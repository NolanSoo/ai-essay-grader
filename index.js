      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. In other words, teachers believe students should continue learning after the school year ends.Â Some might argue that summer projects should be teacher-designed so the student will have the ability to learn over the summer.Â Summer projects should be student-designed because this will allow the student to have more free time, it will allow less stress for the student, and they should decide for themselves stuff relating to the project.\n \n Summer projects should be student-designed because this will allow the student to have more free time.Â For example, the student will be able to catch up on sleep or exercise.Â Students would be able to relax a little more and enjoy their summer off.Â Students will feel more energized and healthy.Â Students will feel better about themselves. Students will feel more relaxed instead of stressed. Students will feel more calm.\n \n Summer projects should be student-designed because it will allow for less stress for the student. For example, the student will feel more calm and the assignment will not be as hard for the student. The student will be able to concentrate more. The student will most likely complete the assignment as this will lead to less procrastination.Â They can work with a friend or group. This could lead to the student not having as much stress as they will be working with a friend. This could help relieve stress.\n \n Summer projects should be student designed because they should decide for themselves stuff relating to the project. For example, the student could decide if they want to work alone or with a friend or group of friends. This may allow the student to have more communications with their friends. This will help the student complete their assignment at hand. This could help students think about what they wanna present for their project when they return to school. This allows the student to make their own desicions. This will help them learn to be independent.\n \n In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed because this will allow the student to have more free time, it will allow for less stress for the student, and they should decide for themselves stuff relating to the project. Some might argue that summer projects should be teacher-designed because this could help the student learn. If the summer projects are teacher-designed, then the student will not have any free time. Overall, this will give the student a lot of free time.",

      "Letting teachers design the project is the most ignorant design ever. Most students would hate to do a teacher design project. The projects should definitely be student design. I strongly believe a summer project is an intelligent way of letting students retain the information. However it should be student design because they'd be more likely to do it, they'd understand the project more, and it gives them responsibility.\n \n Firstly, students would be more likely to participate in a student-designed project. A whole of of students won't be pleased doing a summer project, so the least schools could do is let the students design the project. Also some teachers make projects way too boring. So if the students design the project it'd probably be less boring for them. It'd be much better to let the students could be as creative as they want. When people find something boring they won't do it, especially young people. So letting the students design the project would increase the chances of the student passing the project.\n \n Secondly, the students would understand the project more. Some teachers make extremely confusing rubrics for the project. When teachers make confusing rubrics it causes a negative reaction to the students trying to complete the project. Some students would lose confidence in themselves on the project, which will increase their chances of failing. That would be a horrible startÂ to the new school year. The goal is for students to pass not fail, and teacher design projects would really increase failing chances. Students will have a hard time passing something they don't understand, because like I said earlier; some teachers make really confusing project-designs.\n \n Lastly, is it gives the students more responsibility. Responsibility is one of the most important things a young person can learn. It helps with maturity & being a better adult. So the student would be responsible for the project & designing it. I know it's very little responsibility, however it does help.\n \n Projects should definitely be student designed. Student design projects teaches students more responsibility. Also it would make students more likely to complete the project. If schools do make summer projects, I hope that they are student designed.Â",

      "Some schools implement a summer project to continue the flow of learning, and to ensure that the students' brains retain learned information. When asked to take a position on whether students or teachers should design these projects, I chose both sides. The reasoning behind my decision was quite simple: one side is more knowledgeable when it comes to the information, and has years of experience in teaching on their side. However, nobody knows the experience of living as the secondary group more than they themselves do, so it makes sense that they would have a part in this idea.\n \n Allow me to begin by playing devil's advocate against my own thinking. One may refute my statements with the simple argument of, \"Well, students don't know how to teach, so why should they have a part in this?\". One may also describe my thinking as ineffective by stating along the lines of, \"Well, nobody knows how to plan exciting experiences better than the ones who have to endure them\". Now, both these arguments are well rooted and difficult to counter, however that in and of itself is what lends them to my cause. The first argument supports the idea that teachers are more experienced, thus more prepared to enact such ideas and projects; the second argument then supports my secondary belief, that the students better know themselves, and can lend more than a simple helping hand in the creation of such activities.\n \n Now that I have finished counter-arguing and rebutting, I can begin my statements. I would like to begin with the teachers. My standing on the subject is that teachers are more experienced and better suited to plan the informational aspects of a summer's project. Why, if a student knew the subject matter well enough to plan such an activity, and knew how to best teach and explain it, then they would be in no need of a project or a teacher! Yes, it is the job of the teacher to... well, teach, and it is the job of the student to learn. However, this does not exclude the student from the planning process all together.\n \n The student is quite important, because they are the target audience. They will know, better than anyone, how to reach out and grab hold of their demographic. The student knows what is fun, boring, enticing, and annoying to them as a whole. While it is true that not all students are made equal, and what is fun to one may be dull to another, a democratic poll can be issued to help even the playing field. Alternatively, multiple projects can be issued out to different types of student, or a simple skeleton plan may be issued, with which the students may piece together their own project. Perhaps all three can be issued as a choice, with students choosing which \"flavor\" of project they would find easiest to follow. Yes, the student is an important piece to project design, with the teacher serving a bigger part in project management. Let the demographic choose their product.\n \n As I finish, allow me to restate my core ideas. The teacher is an important utility in the informational and managerial parts of a summer project; however, the student plays just as important a role in the design and creationalÂ aspects. Both sides are nearly equal in importance, and choosing just one as the end all be all is not dissimilar to how American politics are carried out. Yes, it is important to have a fair balance of both sides, with each person playing to their specific strengths. Too much equality and you have a democracy that will never move forwards. Too much freedom and you have a form of communism in which there is no order to help guide everyone to the correct paths. Yes, a balance is much needed; a balance, mind you, that will never be truly found.\n \n That doesn't mean we shouldn't try, however.",

      "Would you want to waste your summer on useless information, or getting a head start on what you are going to learn next year? Teacher-designed summer projects usually prepare you for what you will be learning. So, why not take that chance and have a head start. Teachers make these assignments for the students benefit. It is always better to be prepared, than to be struggling. Summer assignments should be teacher-designed, because the teacher would relate it to what they are going to learn, they could give the students a challenge and choices, and their topics could be more relevant to society.\n \n Although, teacher-designed summer assignments could be more relevant, student-designed assignments would be more fun. The students know what they are interested in more than teachers do. Students could create and design summer assignments that they would enjoy. Doing something fun and entertaining to the students would make their summer not feel like a waste, even though it is for school. However, it may be more fun than if teachers made the assignment, but it would be a waste of time and effort. Students could make the assignment whatever they want and not have it benefit them in any way.\n \n Having a summer assignment about what you are going to learn could help you prepare for that class. Teachers know what their students will be learning, so they should make summer assignments related to that. The assignment would then prepare them for that class next year, and their summer would not have been a waste after all. This could help many students, because everyone learns at a different pace. Students who need more time than others to comprehend the information would be getting a head start. So, when they come into school, they will not be struggling or behind everyone else.\n \n Students could get a challenge or a choice to choose what they want, benefiting them and their interests. If students came up with the assignments, they could be too easy. Teachers know a students limit by their academic skills. If students had a challenge in the summer, it could be something they have never experienced before or thought about. Students would be learning and enjoying their summer at the same time.\n \n Summer assignments should be relevant to society and not useless information. Teachers are usually aware of what is going on in society, whether that is economically or politically. They could make a summer assignment about an issue in our society. If there was a summer assignment like that, there would be many online resources to help the students since it is a current topic. This would also benefit the students by enlightening them in the problems of their own society and community.\n \n In conclusion, summer assignments should be teacher-designed to benefit the student. Not all summer assignments are boring. They might require you to read a book or do some research, but it would help you in the near future. Students who do summer assignments are less likely to be confused or behind in class, since they had a preview of what they were learning. Teacher-designed summer assignments benefit students by giving them a head start on what they are learning, the assignment could be a challenge or a choice, and the topics could relate to society making it more relevant.Â",

      "During summer break, it's a time in which the majority of kids are outside enjoying themselves at the pool,beach, an amusement park, or a new country they've been waiting to visit all year long, but for some kids, however, they are required to complete boring summer long projects that are designed by teachers in order to further develop their education.\n \n When you think about these summer long projects, many of them are designed in a way that makes them a struggle for students to enjoy doing themselves while they're on break, the majority of teachers design these projects as a way of continuing with the development of their students education, but don't put into thought what a student might be doing over the summer and how their project can relate to the activities they do. Some teachers may say that no matter what the students do over the summer, the main goal is to continue with the development of their education, which is completely understandable, but what point is there if these projects are designed in the interests of teachers and not the students.\n \n A summer project isn't something many students enjoy doing, mainly due to all of the months spent in school, but when they're allowed to work on a project with the topic of their choice, or on a project that reflects their summer break, many students would feel enthusiastic about doing their summer project and at the same time, students would feel better with themselves when they make their own decisions in a project rather than have a teacher make the decisions for them and have to follow their guidelines in regards to the project.\n \n In a student's perspective, a summer long project that's designed to improve their education may sound boring to them since they just got out of school, but if students were able to design their own projects and freely decide what their projects would be about, it would be a whole different story. When students are given the freedom of deciding what they want their summer projects to be about, they are capable of understanding the way they express themselves,see their true potential, and further understand how to develop their education based on their strengths and weaknesses.\n \n Schools should consider letting their students design their own summer projects, as a way of helping them develop their education and learning skills. When students are given this opportunity, it's more likely that the student will enjoy working on their project, complete it, and see their academic advancements as they continue to work on their projects.",

      "During the school year, classroom instructions and lessons are prepared and taught by the teachers, so why wouldn't the summer assignments that keeps kids prepared for school, be made by teachers ? Summer assignments allow students the chance to stay ahead of their classwork and curriculum while they are away from school. These assignments help kids in many ways, whether it be to prepare for the SAT, ACT, or just a little head start for an advanced placement class. Teachers know the curriculum of their classes better than some principles, so it is only right that these assignments be prepared by the teachers themselves. Teachers need to be in charge with making their summer assignments because they may have specific ways they want their incoming students to learn, they have the most experience in the subject they teach, and students may be exposed to new styles of learning that could help them far beyond just school.\n \n Teacher-made summer assignments are great for preparing kids for the next chapter of school. With that being said, student-designed assignments would not be such a bad alternative. Students only grasp knowledge and lectures when they find interest in them. What better way on finding out how summer assignments can interest students, then to just let the students come up with the layout of the assignments themselves. Nobody can relate to students more then themselves. Some students are hands on learners while others are more visual learners, students could come up with multipleÂ assignment designs that meets the needs of physical and visual learners. Summer assignments that are made by teachers in one way may not help a physical learner but aid the visual learner, or vice versa and that would not be fair to either student.\n \n At all schools, teachers have a required curriculum they must teach to their students in a certain time period. Allowing the teachers to make the projects would greatly reduce the time spent in the classroom on going backwards in their curriculum to catch students up, and allow them to move forward faster. Many colleges around the world look at the scores of students SAT's and ACT's. These two test have a certain amount of curriculum that is covered through all years of learning. Unfortunately, many teachers do not have enough time to cover all the material on the two tests. Summer assignments give kids that extra needed practice and knowledge to do well on the tests.\n \n The SAT and ACT are not the only test students have to take while they are in school. Students also must take subject specific test and quizzezs for their individual teachers. Since, teachers are responsibleÂ for making their own test for the students, they may have a specific way they want their students to study or look over the material, summer projects are no different. Teachers are human, each one of them has a different method of teaching and testing. By allowing the teacher to design their summer project, it allows for kids to be ready for the methods their teacher uses to test and lecture. Not only could the methods of learning be new to the student, but they also could prefer their teacher's new ways more than what they used in the past.\n \n Summer Projects should be teacher made because they cover materials that students will need to use in the classroom and also show's the student kinda how the teacher likes to teach and deliver the curriculum in the classroom. Teachers go to college for 4 years just so they can teach people. They are the most qualified in helping any person succeed academically. If you are a parent, tell me honestly, would you trust your own child in coming up with their own school assignments ? Â Â Â Â  Â",

      "Why are student-designed summer projects beneficial?\n \n School is important for everyone. The law is that everyone who is born in the United States must attend school. School is a time where you study to get good grades, develop strong bonds with teachers and friends, and having a fun time. During the school year, students get to choose what classes do they want to take. After students select what classes they want to take for next year, they usually get summer assignments or summer projects to prepare them for the upcoming school year. In other states, summer projects or summer assignments are either teacher-designed or student-designed. I always preferred that summer projects should be student-designed because it allows the student to have creativity, an easier way to self-study, and it engages the student's learning.\n \n Doing a project brings astonishing ideas to a student. When the teacher gives a simple task to do a project by using tri-fold display boards, construction paper, and color; it gives the student the freedom of what they want to create. Students grow a mindset of what will help them. Some students do well by being creative because some of themÂ are visual learners. Visual learners understand materials by looking at a specific picture to capture the concept, so it can be a part of their memory. When creative students start coloring; it gives them less stress. Less stress causes to work faster and gives relief, and it helps them to make a nice presentation. Creativity also brings the teachers attention when it's time to present. Teachers will see that these creative students took their time to make a neat artwork and helped them to understand their assignment by designing it themselves.\n \n Self-studying prevents the student to be behind. Self-studying can be hard at first, but once you understand how to do it and manage it; therefore, it becomes easier. Studying by yourselfÂ doesn't make youÂ re-read, highlight, and memorize the textbook the whole day. UseÂ different ways to study such as doing projects, making flashcards, or teaching it to a friend. Most of these self-study learners make detailed projects to make it enjoyable for them, and it can make them motivated. For example, you are taking an biology class in the fall. Your assignment says to make a project that makes you notice nature. You come up with a brilliant idea and make a bird feeder. You use creative ideas along the way such as making a bird feeder out of an old milk carton. After that, you put half of the seeds inside and the other half on the ground.Â To observe your data, you would see which type of birds came to your feeder, what time, and what day of the week. This shows that you noticed nature by motivation and self studying by making data.\n \n During the summer, students learn new material for their future classes. When learning about new knowledge during break, it makes students more engaged. Students don't have a deadline when they can study, so they take it easy by doing it step by step. Since some students get bored over the summer, they get curious to find new things. There are students who make their own projects to see how intelligent they are in that subject. By making projects, students have the will to discover their learning path. They have the time to go out to different museums or national parks for ideas for their project. They notice what they can establish in their future life by observing areas, so then they research more to make their summer project even better. The students designed their own projects by having the time to explore around themselves, making experiments, and taking risks. All of this helps them to engage their learning.\n \n In conclusion, projects should be student-designed because it allows the student to have creativity, an easier way to self-study, and it engages the student's learning. Making summer projects that are student-designed helps learning grow and makes teachers proud of what their students can accomplish. Student-designed projects give no procrastination, spend more time with friends, and manages your time easily. This is why student-designed projects are more beneficial than teacher-designed projects. Â Â Â",

      "The idea of summer projects for students is a great way to assure that they are continuing to learn outside of school independently. This is true when the students have the freedom and responsibility to choose which subject they want to deepen their knowledge about. Although teachers have the ability to design specific projects that relate directly to the curriculum, students would find completing their projects more enjoyable if they had the freedom to research a topic that they experienced first hand, as well as displaying an opportunity to those who travel and may research different cultures.\n \n Schools that allow the students to design their summer projects may include a list of topics provided by teachers to assure all students remain on task with the curriculum as well as develop a passion for their topic. With a list of examples provided, students may get creative with ideas and become passionate about their work, which should be the most important goal schools attempt to get their student to achieve. With passion, students become motivated to continue studying even when it is summer break.\n \n Moreover, those fortunate enough to travel have endless possibilities when designing their projects: from the chemical makeup of jet planeÂ fuel to the traditionsÂ and customs of villages in third world countries, there is no limit. By being able to experience new cultures, examine pieces of art work, sight seeÂ great monuments, etc..., students may design extravagant projects that expose others to what they have experienced. When students present their project at the beginning of the following school year, those who did not get to travel may learn about topics they weren't able to experience themselves, making all students inclusive in eachothers summer activities.\n \n Although some may believe that teachers should design the student's projects, this should not be the case if schools wish for their students to learn to be responsible and independent. If teachers were to design the projects, yes, it would be guaranteed that it follows the curriculum, but there will be a clear lack of passion in the student's work. Forcing a topic students have no interest in or are unable to experience first hand will bring the students to resent learning during their break. And for those traveling, some may not have access to specific requests the teachers assign, forcing them to either return home to complete their project or to produce something mediocre. Students being able to design their own project that works best around their schedule would benefit everyone.\n \n Schools who allow students to design their own projects are giving the opportunity to be creative, independent, and responsible. With passion mixed in, possibilities for greatness are endless. Schools that have teachers design projects should reconisder and follow the schools that allow students' footsteps.",

      "Education is, without a doubt, a necessity in order to ensure a successful life- and it is the school's job to give the students exactly that. During the school year, they do so with classes and homework, but what about when school is already over? Many schools opt to let the students rest during these times, but some schools decide to take it up another step with summer projects. How the projects should be conducted, though, has been a matter of debate recently, and many are taking different positions and stances on the issues, largely divided into two different sides: teacher-directed and student-directed. The teacher-directed side believes that the teachers should take the lead and decide what they expect from the project, while the student-directed side believes that giving the students more freedom in what to do will allow them to learn more in the process. While it is easy to see how students would like a project designed by themselves, school projects should still be primarily designed and directed by the teachers.\n \n To start, teacher-designed projects allow for a more intuitive and in-depth project that students could not develop on their own. A human's brain does not develop fully adulthood; it is immature, and as such, leaves students prone to make decisions that may harm their own education. Furthermore, teachers have gone through rigorous training and have an intimate knowledge of their own subject, and thus can create projects that are on topic and beneficial to a student's education; on the other hand, students are only beginning to learn their subjects, and do not have the proper training or the knowledge required to create a project that allows them to learn.\n \n However, some may think that teacher-designed projects limit creativity and make the projects overall less enjoyable for the students. It is easy to think that way, but by limiting some creativity, teachers are actually ensuring proper education during the summer. If a student designed a project, for example, they could deliberately make the project simple, giving themselves an easy grade when, in reality, they learned nothing. To continue, the students could derail the project, straying away from what the teacher or school intended for them. All of these and more make the projects pointless and a waste of resources and time, but teacher-designed projects ensure that students stay on topic, while also raising the quality and benefits of the projects by requiring a bare minimum.\n \n Finally, teacher-designed projects allow for a standardized rubric that makes grading easier and simpler for teachers. Student-designed projects can be anything, especially since the teachers do not have control over them. Consequently, the teachers must adapt in response to the varied project types and qualities, making a rubric harder to define. This means that teachers require more time and effort to grade each project, making an already exhausting task even more arduous. However, a teacher-designed project is the same for every student, meaning everyone makes the same thing about the same topics. This lets the teachers focus on assessing more important skills and the quality of the project instead of checking solely completion.\n \n In short, a student-designed project simply cannot provide the in-depth education that a teacher-designed project gives. Summer break, while it is indeed a break, does not mean education ever stops. It is up to summer projects- and teachers, consequently- to keep it that way.",

      "Summer projects can be a helpful tool for both teachers and students to ensure that students will be ready for the next school year and not forget what they learned the previous year. Summer projects should be enriching, creative, and fun for students. While a student-designed project may be creative and fun, it would most likely lack the enrichment component which is the whole point of having summer projects. Ultimately, teachers know better than students how to prepare for the upcoming school year, which is why these summer projects should be teacher-designed rather than student-designed.\n \n Student-designed projects may sound like a good idea at first, but students would not be able to create a project that would prepare themselves well enough for the next year; at least not the same way teachers can. Students are already unmotivated to do any summer homework let alone projects. However, there is definitely an appeal to creating your own projects, which would help motivate students to complete and do a good job with the project. Most likely though, if students were given free reign to design their summer project themselves, they would take advantage of the opportunity and make a project that is too easy and in the end, unhelpful. This outcome would be even worse than just doing a teacher-designed project which would actually help students.\n \n Teachers know exactly how to prepare students for the next year, so although their project may be harder and not as fun, it would pay off in the long run and help students develop important skills they would need for the next year. Because the goal of summer projects is to make sure students are learning over break, teachers tend to focus too much on the content of the project and often do not make the project creative or fun. Often times, a teacher-designed summer project will be to read a book, analyze it, and write an ESSAY about it. These types of projects are not fun for students, and the result would be a clear lack of effort from the student. I myself have experienced this, and know firsthand that students need to be interested in the project to ensure quality work. In order to avoid this and cater to students creativity, teachers should design multiple projects for students to choose from incorporating various skills such as art, writing, or research. This way, students have a choice and can pick whichever project they would have the most fun doing.\n \n Ultimately, teachers know what they are doing better than students, and can make summer projects fun for the student while also helping them continue learning for the next year. Teachers can always get feedback from students and implement new ideas on how to improve the same project to make it better for the next year, whereas students would not be able to do this. With having more experience and knowledge, it is best that the design of summer projects be left to the teachers.Â",

Knowing some of the knowledge will make the students dive deeper into the material and learn new things. Creativity allows students to think outside the box and explore beyond technology. Giving students the responsibility of choosing their own subject would make them interested into doing their project and enjoy making it.\n \n Students should do their projects based on what they are most familiar with. It would make it easier for them to do a project based on what they already know, so they would most likely start it immediately. They could also search through the web for new information. They benefit from it because they get to learn new material and are able to use it for the project. Although searching through the web is easy and fast, they could also visit places related to what their subject is about and collect new information from the place they visited. They can learn by being physically there and understand deeper by doing hands on work.\n \n Creativity allows them to think outside the box. Depending on the subject, they could experiment new things. They could use their mind freely and do whatever they would like to do. For example, teachers would be strict about what they would like the students to do and use but since you are free to be creative; you would be able to organize the information however you want it to be organized and how to introduce your project.

      "Certain schools make students complete a summer project to make sure students are still learning over their summer break. There is an ongoing debate over if teachers should design these projects or if students should. Some believe that the student should design the project because it is their summer break and it gives them time to be creative but this is not true. Teachers should design the summer project, not the students.\n \n There are a variety of reasons why teachers should design the project. Teachers purpose in this is to make sure the students project is educational and will benifit them in the long run. A teacher is a professional and will most likey pick a topic that will help them through the summer untill they get to school. Students might pick a topic or design their project on something that might not benefit them significantly educationally. Along with teacher design would come clear and formal instructions. Provided the teacher designs the project the instrustions should be crystal clear and students will be on the right path and most likely less confused than if they had to do it all themselves. Teacher design will aswell booost the project in looking more formal provided rubric can show expectations that need to be met. When teachers provide a project for their class, everyone has the same assignment, and it not only makes it easier for them but the students. This makes said project still formal but everyone can add their creative skills making it more personal giving it their own twist. With the same summer project and teachers permission, it would aswell be easier to work with others and share ideas. Teacher design benefits the students.\n \n There are further reasons on why teachers should be the ones designing students projects. Teachers know what will benefit the students, preparing them for their next year. Edcationally they will design a project based to fit their class and that will help their students. This is teachers being hard working and picking themselves what is best for their students. As stated previously everyone having the same project would benefit the teachers aswell. Multiple projects after a long summer is hard to grade but with everyone having the same assignment and rubric it would make it easier for the hard working teachers. The teacher deciding and designing how they would want their project would asvwell be a plus for them. They decide how they want it as well as theirs expectations, which makes it clearer for the student to unerstand as stated previously. Teachers designing the summer/schiool year projects benefit both students and teachers.\n \n The summer project should be designed by the teachers and not the students. There are many reasons why teachers should design it, for example it makes it easier for both the teachers and the students in the long run. those who disagree state that it would make it easier, more creative, and fun for the students but realistically this is not true. School work at anytime of the year should be designed and given by the school, this puts order in the school system.",

      "Schools should have summer projects be teacher-designed because teachers will pick projects that they know will be usefull to students, teachers put their full time and effort, and teachers will also make the project enjoyable to the students.\n \n Teachers have created many projects for many of their students, making them have a lot more credibility than students to construct a project. Teachers will know what information will be on the project makin it easier for them to construct projects that they know will be of use to students in the future. They all have insight on what a student should learn and what a student should not learn because they have been teaching all year long to students. They would take out all the useless information because they know how to filter it out, while students are learning themselves and will not know how to identify usefull information from useless making teachers more credible on the projects that would be assigned to students. Teachers can also make this project very clear and precise so that students will not get confused on what to do, how to research it, and how to write it professionally, unlike students who always go out of their way to make the project more lengthy and the basis of the project a lot more confusing to understand. Teacher know about the main ideas or concepts about these projects while students are unaware of these main ideas because they are yet to learn about it.\n \n So many teachers put so much time and effort into teaching their class everyday for an eight-month period, which makes it easier for them to create projects because they are so comfortable in this type of creative/learning environment. They put maximum effort to make all this information very precise and straight to the point while students usually, when it does not affect their grade, slack the work load by doing creating he project half-heartedly and not with their full time making the learning experience for the students researching the project also not as fulfilled to learn. When people make it seem like they put their full effort into teaching you about something, that sense or feeling that they invested a part of time into making your learning experience a lot more impactful, you are more compelled to study and learn about what they are teaching you and telling you to pracitce, which is what teacher do and are meant to do. Teachers will always have the time to give out and make projects because that is their job and they have to take it serious unlike students who either creating the project is not fulfilled to do their part or students just do not have the time of day to invest their time into projects. If students do take an investment of time to create these projects, they will not be able to focus on the other important things that they have to get done.\n \n Teachers also have a way of making learning a lot more fun and interactive on their daily teaching schedule, therefore, making them have a way to encapture a students attention into making these projects a lot more enthusiastic and enjoyable to research on. Teachers also make the projects a lot less objective based learning, teachers want to make sure that you understand the content to its fullest extent while also maintaining a curiousness towards the basis of the project, unlike students who make the project seem very boring, uninteresting, and very objective based learning which will make students to never research anything about that certain topic again because they could not learn anything fun about it or there was no interactiveness between the students and the project they were assignes to.\n \n In short, teachers have a better advantage and a lot more insight on how to design these projects because they know what information that will be of use to students, they put the maximum amount of time and effort, and they make the learning experience more enthusiastic and enjoyable to the students doing research on them. Teachers always seem to have the upper hand about how to pass off knowledge and wisdom because of these reasons.Â Â",

      "As a student, the summer projects should be teacher-designed projects. Summer projects should be teacher-designed projects due to the fact that teachers know what the students need to learn in the next grade. For an example, in first grade you learn how to add and subtract using double digit number, if the teachers designs the project for the summer you will have more knowledge about adding and subtracting. Also, teachers know the material to help you succeed in school. Not to mention that if the student designs it how would students gain knowledge of it? As students, they would rather have easier homework and easier projects rather than homework and projects the will benefit you. Lastly, teachers know what is needed to know in the upcoming grade; So the teacher-designed can help them prepare for the next grade.\n \n Student based projects are not a good idea for several different reasons. The student-designed projects are not beneficial to students due to the fact that students don't know what is going to be learned in the next grade level, so how they going to know how their own project is going to benefit themselves? As for teachers, they are going to know what is coming up in the upcoming grade. Another reason is due to the fact that students are going to do a easy projects. Not all easy projects benefit you to have more knowledge, therefore teachers design the projects so that students could gain more knowledge off the project. Lastly, the teacher-design project is going to prepare you for the next grade, so you will be more advanced with subject when you get in the class next year.\n \n To sum up, Teacher-design summer project benefit you in many different ways. It can benefit you by working to learn upcoming material. Teacher-design projects also benefits you by teachers knowing what is needed to know in the next grade. Finally, it benefits you because teachers know what is coming up in the upcoming grade level, so it helps you prepare for the next grade level. Student-designed can also benefit you in gaining knowledge, but not as much knowledge from teachers-designed projects.",

      "Most students look forward to the last few days of school, those last few moments when the bell is about to ring and they can all go and hang out, or just go home and relax. After a whole school year's worth of work they are ready to take a nice break. But then those hopes are ultimately hurt a little when a teacher announces that the students are to complete projects over the summer. These projects should be student designed because of the work being assigned over vacation, giving the students a chance to self-govern themselves, and because they will have extra free time to work with.\n \n Some teachers would agree that if the students were to assign themselves projects, nothing would get done, or the students would not learn anything new. This really should not matter in the long term as the teachers already have enough control during the school year, and the students really should be allowed a break from all this learning. If the students do not get the break they might need, than what is the point of a vacation?\n \n Speaking of that vacation, students need that time to relax and unwind, preparing themselves for the next year. Some parents might even have big vacation plans over the summer to take their families interesting places. This means that a student will have to work his or her summer homework around the vacation time, which, in some cases, can be really challenging. One student might have a big project to get done, but their parents announce that they are taking a family vacation to Germany for a couple of weeks. Of course, this might not seem like a lot of time, when school stops, that does not mean everything else does as well. These students might have jobs to keep up with or other responsibilities outside of school, these projects just make things even harder than they need to be. When you give students a larger window to finish something, they get the chance to improve their leadership skills, either in a group, or with themselves.\n \n Students who design their own projects will get the chance to self-govern themselves, meaning they have more time to make creative decisions that can improve the project, rather than just having a week or so to finish it where they might rush it, or cannot dedicate enough time outside of school to get it done in time, lowering the overall quality. When students get to make these creative decisions, they can make the students think in new ways and bring out more interesting decisions to make the projects stand out a little more. All of this culminates in the extra free time the students have to think, execute, and produce a well-made product.\n \n The extra free time gives students more freedom to try more ambitious projects without the pressure of all the work that needs to be done within a week. The project will be able to develop naturally over time. If teachers assign these projects, then either the student will feel less compelled to do it, or it will not turn out as well because the student might not want to do that type of project in the first place. This extra free time is a great source for creativity and good student led projects because the students will be more compelled to do the work right, rather than just get through it so they can actually enjoy their break.\n \n Overall, these students would really feel bummed if they were required to do extra work over the summer for seemingly no reason at all, other than to continue learning. With student-designed projects, students will still get to enjoy their vacation, while learning more about self-governing, and making good use of their extra free time. Going to school is not something that everyone in the world enjoys, but is required, so if the teachers are really going to strip away some of the student's free time, at least let the students be in control. If you give the children more freedom, the creative results may be beyond anything you have ever seen.",

      "Summer school projects should be student lead because they allow students to keep their brain fresh, achieve a goal, and understand new concepts. School projects over the summer should be student designed. This allows students to keep their brain active, have a goal to accomplish, and learn new things. Projects to complete over the summer are a good tool for schools to use to keep their students ready.\n \n Some students might think a project for school over the summer is tyranny, however, keeping your brain thinking is very important. An interesting project, that should be mainly student-designed so completion is high, is a good brain helper. A benefit of the project will be once the students go back to school, it'll be easier to jump back into familiar topics because your brain has had a refresher recently. Freshman year of high schoolÂ I had an English project over the summer on Mythology which greatly helped me when I returned to school and Mythological stories was our first unit. Overall, keeping your brain up-to-date is an excellent way to be confident in your schooling career.\n \n During summer break a lot of kids end up being bored at home just watching TV or playing video games. A project, designed by students so the kids can stay engaged and interested, could shake this monotony and give the student a goal to accomplish. Goals are important and they lead to the person feeling good about themselves once they complete said goal. On the other hand, a student might say how they don't need a goal to stay active during the summer but they can always benefit from something to hold them accountable so just in case the student starts heading on a downward trend, the goal can lift them up and set them back on track.\n \n Learning new things is an important task to do often. Having a student lead project is a great strategy to allow kids to find and learn new things, explore new concepts, and complete tasks efficiently. Kids learning new things over the summer with a rigorous yet interest-grabbing project is an excellent way to expand the classroom horizon once school is back in session. It allows the teacher to make new teaching decisions such as what projects will look like in the future, what kind of strategies to teach with, and if said teacher can branch off into side topics that they usually couldn't branch off into.\n \n In conclusion, school-assigned projects should be student-designed so interest and completion is high, goals are made and completed, and the students' brain is kept in top shape. The ability a kid has to learn by themselves over the summer should be tapped into by schools more often. Projects to complete over the summer are a perfect tool to keep kids fresh and ready for when school starts back up.",

Students are constantly given assignmentsÂ of which they have chosen and yet, some still never take the addictiveÂ to do the work to help them succeed.

Students should have a teacher-designed project because it would encourage them, there would be guidelines and less stress on choosing a topic.\n \n Firstly, some people doÂ not that have the motivation to do a projects and they need something to help keep them on track and push them to do it. Some students have a problem withÂ procrastination when it comes to big assessments such as projects, an ESSAY, or even a simple PowerPoint. For example, they have a 600 word ESSAY due in 2 weeks and its worth 30% of their grade. They will wait 2 days before it is due to finally take time and do it. If a teacher were to have something they have to work toward that they would really want to would drive them to do their best.\n \n Secondly, when there are guidelines to a project it gives that sense of urgency. A project or any assignment should be done without some source of instruction or direction on what to do. For example, if they were given an assignment and just told to do it would come out extremely unorganized. Teachers being in charge of a summer project is much better than students handling it because they have deadlines for each part of the project\n \n However some students want to do a project on something they chose and feel as though they need help with. For example, there is a student who has aced every single lesson that the teacher has taught but, the last lesson that they learned they really had a hard time on understanding it and its time for the projects the be assigned. They were assigned something that they knew with their eyes closed. Although, that may be true having a teacher-designed project is a lot easier because all they would have to is do the work instead of stressing about what they can do their project on.\n \n In conclusion, when an assignedÂ is monitored by a teacher it is more likely to go smoother than leaving the responsible to get their work done up to them to decide.

      "Summer projects is an excellent way for students to continue learning and to grow academically during breaks while having fun doing it. When teachers assign projects which is designed by them, it decreases the student's motivation to complete the project because students find it amusing to design and create their own projects and not the other way around. Another reason why summer projects should be student-designed is because students are able to research many topics which they could potentially be interested in. Summer projects during the break should be student-designed because it increases student motivation to complete the project, students are able to gain knowledge on something they came up with themselves, and they are able to have fun while conducting research on their own topics.\n \n The first reason why summer projects should be student-designed is because of the increase in motivation. Students are motivated when they are interested in what the project is about. When the project is teacher-designed, student's lack the motivation to complete the task as they could be uninterested in the project the teacher had assigned them. Some students might assume the project will be tedious because the teacher is assigning it and as a result, feel unmotivated. For example, When the teacher assigns a project, it can be difficult to research and come up with ideas which leads to the students feeling stressed and confused on what to do regarding the project. But when a student designs their own projects, they probably already have an idea or information on the topic of their project. Another example is when students are assigned a project, and there is a choice to organzie and create your own project for extra credit, students are motivated to perorm well on the project. That is why schools should have students perform research on their own project topic because it motivates them to get it nicely done. An increase in motivation means an increase in the quality of the project and the thought of satisfaction while completing it\n \n The second reason why summer projects should be student-designed is because students are able to gain a tremendous amount of knowledge as they are coming up with their own ideas on researching, creating, and completing their own projects. For example, during the break, multiple students travel out of state or out of the country. When the students go on vacation, they will locate lots of great topics and ideas to research on. Therefore, increasing the student's knowledge on the topic or idea of the project. This causes the students to become more erudite during the break and when they return back to school from the break. Although the students will still gain knowledge on a teacher-designed project, they do not gain a much broader view on the topic of the project. Another example is when a student works at someplace he or she enjoys working at and decides to do their project on that particular job. This is going to increase the sudent's knowledge as the student is researching more information about the job whilst also learning more about the place he or she works at.\n \n The third reason why summer projects should be student-designed is because students are able to have fun while conducting a research on their topic. Students always want something fun to do; therefore, by designing their own projects, they are able to make it as fun as they want. When the teacher designs the project, the students would probably assume that it is dull. For example, when a student does something for fun over the break, they could do their project on what they did instead of doing a project on something they have never done before. Another example is when a teacher-designed project is assigned and the teacher is extremely facetious about what and what not to include in the project. When this happens, the students won't find the project to be amusing or interesting.\n \n In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed as it greatly benefits the students in many ways such as motivating them, allowing them to gain more knowledge, and having fun whilst working on the project. When teachers design projects for their students, they are not allowing the students to fully expand into many areas but allowing them to conduct a research and work on their project in a way they want it to be done, which limits the students ability to be motivated to work on the project, to gain knowledge on the project, and to enjoy working on the project.",

      "In some schools, projects are given to students to be completed over summer break. The reason a vigarious assignment is given is to assure students will be continuously learning over the summer when schools are temporarily closed. However, should summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Teacher-designed projects should be required for all students. Why should teacher-designed projects be a requirement instead of student-designed projects? Teacher-designed projects expand learning and the teacher is aware of what the students will be learning.\n \n To begin, teachers will be aware that all students are obtaining the same information. For example, a project was given by a teacher specifically on the topic saving and investing in today's economy. The teacher knows that all students will be researching and learning the concepts of saving and investing today. All students gained identical information and knowledge on one specific topic. On the other hand, if projects were student-designed there will be little unity of knowledge amongst students who are of equal age and grade classification.\n \n To continue, teacher-designed projects will expand the knowledge of students. If projects were student-designed they would more likely focus on a topic they already have prior knowledge about rather than stepping outside of their comfort zone. Teacher-designed projects tend to include circulum that students need to know that will help them grow academically. For instance, a group of girls in a high schoolÂ class were given a black history project. They did their project on Misty Copeland, an African-American ballet dancer, who they had previously researched before. They had information instilled into their minds and had already known about her accomplishments and struggles. They did not learn anything about her, because they had done projects before. With that being said, students will not willingly learn anything new if they designed their on projects. Teacher-designed projects would have a more positive impact, because it is being given by a teacher who can academically prepare students for the next school year.\n \n Last but not least, teacher-designed projects enforce specific directions and learning criteria. The projects will less likely be done incorrectly. Directions and criteria is specific, so it will not be off topic and the students will not be learning unnecessary information that will not help them. Teacher-designed projects are more focused on criteria that students need to know.\n \n Conversely, student-designed projects can be more engaging for students who like to be creative, or do things in their own manner. The options are limitless and researching what a student wants to learn will inspire them to obtain more knowledge to share with their peers. Students will be more interested in a project they can create themselves and that leads to results such as less cheating. On the other hand, teacher-designed projects should be required, because some students will focus on what they already know rather than willingly learning something new. The projects that are teacher-designed will less likely be done incorrectly.\n \n In conclusion, teacher-designed projects will not limit students to what they already know, but will help them grow academically. The projects that are teacher-designed will less likely be done incorrectly,Â because the teacher specifies instructions and limits the topics for their projects. Students will flourish more when projects are teacher-designed rather than student-designed. Schools should require summer projects that are teacher-designed.Â",

Summer projects designed by students would more efficient than ones designed by teachers.\n \n There are various reasons why student-designed are better at promoting learning during Summer. Students will have more choices of what they can learn about instead of being restricted to what a teacher assigns them for that class. This means students can research subjects ,outside of the curriculum,Â that they may be interested in for their project. Learning about what interests them will motivate students to work harder on their task. Students will want to put more into their project in because it's personal to them, unlike projects designed by teachers. In addition, students won't feel like their time is being wasted on something they see no benefit in. Teacher-designed projects such as research papers, posters, and presentations can be mundane and seem utterly pointless. Students will want to prioritize jobs, relaxation and their social life over a project that they don't have any interest in.\n \n There are additional reasons as to why summer projects should be designed by students. Students will have to complete the project they made on their own free time. This will prepare them for the future, where they have to be responsible enough to set up and accomplish goals independently, without anyone demanding them to. Teachers often make projects that require students to reach very high standards. Failing to meet these standards usually results in failure of the project, which can be stressful. Student-designed projects allow students to reach their own standards, which can make Summer break less stressful. Finally, student-designed summer projects give students something to look forward to. They can be productive and learn without feeling like their summer vacation is being intruded by school work.\n \n Projects assigned during summer break would be more beneficial when designed by students rather than teachers. This is because it causes less stress, makes the students responsible for their work, and motivates them. Those who are opposed to this state teacher-designed projects encourage critical thinking, and learning during Summer, but this is not the case.

      'Should summer projects be designed by teachers or students? Some schools require students to complete summer projects to make sure they are still learning during their break. The most simple thing to do, is to have the teachers design the projects, but why not let the students think for themselves. My take on this, is that students should have to put a little effort in, for once. Summer projects should be student-designed because they deserve some freedom, can show off their intelligence, and will help them develop life skills.\n \n Some may say teachers are more educated and have more experience; That might be true, but how are the students supposed to get a real experience if they never get to design their own project. My friends like when a teacher gives the class a project that is already planned out. The reason they enjoy this is because they are lazy and do not have to do any work. Teachers know a lot of information which should be passed on to their students. Although, that statement is true, when do the students get to pass their information to the teacher?\n \n Student-designed projects give the kids freedom in what they choose to do. At my old school, the students would have to read one book in the summer and then write a report on it. All my classmates would be so happy because they had the choice to read whatever they wanted. A teacher once told me, "freedom is a gift; We do not get that gift often and it is a mistake." This means, students are rarely given any freedom and all that does is limit them.\n \n Student-designed projects would help teachers see how intelligent their students are. In\n \n Kung Fu Panda , Master Shifu learns from watching Po move around the kitchen, that he has plenty of skill. In that scene, the master learns how much potential the student has by watching him do his own thing. In middle school, we would do our summer projects based on any news topic we read. This allowed the teachers to not only get an idea of who the students are, but also show them a baseline of how smart they are, as well.\n \n The projects that students self-design will help them develop life skills. A student creating a project on their own teaches them responsibility and problem solving. The student will have to find a solution to their topic, which shows responsibility by being able to complete this task well enough, to receive a good grade. My father believes summer projects he had to create on his own assisted him to where he is today. My dad thinks this because it showed him time management, which is a life skill students will need forever.\n \n Summer projects are meant to help students continue to learn over a long break. Although, why not make summer projects have more value? Instead, schools can help the students do more than just learn over break. Summer projects should be student-designed because they should have choice, will show off their intellect, and assists them in developing life skills. The school systems need to work together, to take action on making student-designed projects a priority, for getting students the best education.Â',

      "Should summer projects be Teacher-designed, or Student-designed? I believe that summer projects should be mainly Student-designed, with teacher approval. I believe this because of my own personal experiences. Students that I've seen who receive summer projects are not very interested, if ever interested, in the project assignments they receive. A way to get them more engaged is to have them pick a topic they would be interested in. As long as it pertains to the class of course, this is where teacher approval would take place.\n \n I believe summer projects should be Student-designed. One of the reasons I believe this is because I've seen students struggle with assignments they don't like, so much so, it can come to a point where they either give up,Â or don't even attempt it. My second reason is because it adds a level of involvement from the student, that ensures they're aware of how the assignment is to be done, as well as, their own personal spin on what their project is going to be.\n \n Summer projects should be Student-designed because prompts given by teachers can be quite boring, causing a lack of drive to finish the project, let alone attempt it. Some kids partake in summer jobs, or leave for vacation. The situation concerning the varying student should be reflected in their summer projects as being individualized. What I mean for this is, a student who is busy all the time doesn't always have the time to do a project. Even if they enjoy the content. The form of their project should also vary due to their location. Weather they're traveling all the time, and can only complete the project on an airplane, or maybe they live in an environment without constantÂ Wifi. Giving the student the opportunity to form their own assignment can add a level of enjoyment, to an already chaotic lifestyle thatÂ any student could be living with. Rather the alternative. A standardized project that only 65% of students are likely to turn in.\n \n My Second reason is the level of involvement shown by a student who gets to choose their own topic. Not only will they be more involved, and in sync with what they need to accomplish, they will be able to complete it faster, if not better than they would without their own involvement. Showing this type of involvement can help the student have a better understanding on what their end goal is, and how they can accomplish it, resulting in better work. As well as readiness in the classroom when they come back from summer break. Seeing as how the students don't receive teacher guidance over the summer, if they have a full understanding on their own project, it can result to having a better understanding for the transition into the next year.\n \n Someone who would disagree with my statements would believe that Teacher-designed summer projects are much better for the student. Some reasons for this would be, an extra workload on the student, or possible inappropriate content chosen by the student. In a students life there can be little free time, as life is different for eachÂ student, and adding on the creation of their own project, just adds onto the workload for both teachers and students.\n \n In conclusion I believe that summer projects should be student oriented. A student can show more interest in a personalized project. Secondly a student can gain a better comprehension on what theyre trying to learn from their own project that they enjoy. While some would say that it's an extra burden on teachers to add individualized projects, I believe that the American education system needs to be less standardized. and more individual. We all learn differently, and not every method of teaching is helpful t'words a students education.",

      "As summer starts to roll around, students usually start taking their school work less and less seriously. WhenÂ students are in control of what they are doing, or working on, they are more likely to complete what they started. When a student gets assigned to complete something its harder for them to finish, or to start at all.\n \n These summer projects should be student-designed because students tend to do better when they enjoy what they are working on. When teachers assign work for students to complete, they design it in a more complex manner rather than taking a simpler approach. Many students have more ideas which interest them, that the teachers might not consider, or think of when designing these projects. When teachers design these projects they lead to no benefits on either side. Students should be able to use their imagination and creativity while being on summer break as wellÂ as their knowledge.\n \n Students are always limited when it comes to teacher-designed projects. Such as when a student is assigned something that does not pertain to their life or the real world. This always leads to inactivity or procrastination which then leads to no work being done at all. This also almost never interests the student which makes the work harder, and less easy to focus on. Over the course of a month or two, people in general tend to get bored of things quickly, so it is always good to be working on something that interests them, or that they enjoy.\n \n Teacher-designed projects can also be a good thing as it can guide a student on where to start. It can also give them ideas on what to do, but it is also a gateway for them to not get as good of a grade as they could have gotten if they used their full potential. For example, when a student gets assigned to write a persuasive ESSAY, they would most likely not incorporate any of their own ideas, but rather things they read from other sources. If the student wrote an auto biography on themselves that would spark their interest because it pertains to their own life. They would not have to go out of their way to use sources on something they do not care for.\n \n All in all students should be in control of what they are working on in their own free time, a time especially like summer. When something like a summer assignment is assigned to a student they should automatically have the right to design their own project. They should be able to base their work off their own ideas. When a student is designing their own project they have the best way of knowing exactly what they are doing, which will lead to better results. Lastly they should not have to worry about meeting someones' expectations but their standards,so them designing their own project will lead to less stress as well.",

    ESSAY:
      "Summer vacation offers a wonderful opportunity for adventure, creativity, and imagination often needed during a young adult's adolescence. However, many children and teens often lose their sense of work ethic during the summer, something that they worked so hard to achieve throughout the school year. To retain this sense of work ethic during the summer, many schools often require students to complete summer projects for a grade. Summer projects should be teacher-designed as opposed to student-designed in order to ensure the project is on the right topic and to leave no room for error during grading or cheating.\n \n Firstly, summer projects should be teacher-designed as opposed to student-designed in order to leave no room for error during grading and to eliminate the possibility of cheating. When teachers design their own projects for their students, they have a clear picture of what is required of their students and how to grade them to a high standard. To ensure this, for example, teachers create rubrics that match exactly how they want projects to be done. This leaves no room for error in student projects, as they can follow word for word what the rubric says with no confusion. When students do not have rubrics and are tasked at designing a project for themselves, it is more time consuming for the teacher, as they have to grade each project individually, leaving more room for error as the projects are open-ended, and unfair as each student is then held at a different standard due to uniqueness of projects. Another example of leaving no room for error is a teacher's use of the website\n \n Turnitin. com. Turnitin is a website that teachers use that examines grammar, spelling, use of proper citations, and plagiarism. This Einstein of a website ensures that every project, paper, and presentation that is written online can successfully be graded without the worry of plagiarism, something that lazy students often turn to as a result of desperation after a long period of procrastination. Summer projects that are teacher-designed can use\n \n Turnitin as a grading system to make sure that there is no plagiarismÂ or cheating between students in the school or county, as it would be hard to do if each project was student-based, because many students often prefer to submit their projects using paper-boards or by printing them. Even though the students could have easily plagiarized or cheating on their presentations, teachers will never know unless they use\n \n Turnitin and design the project for themselves. Summer projects should be teacher-designed instead of student-designed because it ensures that every students' project will be on the same topic and graded the same way to ensure fairness, accurate grading, and more time efficiency.\n \n Secondly, summer projects should be teacher-designed as opposed to student-designed to make sure that every student is doing a project on the right topic. By letting teachers design their own summer projects, students are introduced early to what they will be learning throughout the school year in order to get back into the groove of schoolwork and school. An example of these projects are advanced placement biology courses that require summer projects. These advanced placement biology projects are teacher-designed, meaning that the topic, type of presentation, and rubric are already picked for students. When the project is teacher-designed, students are able to better grasp the details of the project and have an insight on what they are going to learn in the actual course. This also helps students come to school prepared, having foreknowledge of the topic the course starts with, which boosts confidence and ease in the class, as opposed to when students design their own summer projects, which may not even be about the core topics learned class, and eventually proven to be unnecessary. Another example of how teacher-designed projects ensure that every student is doing a project on the right topic is by requiring the student to do required reading and research before the class begins, such as in literary courses that require students to read specific books throughout the course. When students are required to read specific books, such as\n \n Lord of the Flies in tenth grade and\n \n The Great Gatsby in eleventh, students are less likely to read the book, instead opting for reading a summary of the book and spoilers online, and in some cases, watching the movie. When a student is tasked with designing their own project for a book or other topic, they always choose an easier, more simple topic that requires no effort or actual understanding of the book. However, when teachers design projects, they ask for specific knowledge of the events that happened the a book, requiring students to use quotes or examples from the text, essentially forcing them to actually do the reading and create an understanding for the book themselves. This is a good thing, because it ensures that the students are actually learning, as opposed to taking the easy way out of things and barely putting effort into their project. Summer projects should be teacher-designed as opposed to student-designed to make sure that every student is doing a project on the right topic because it gives students an understanding of what the course will be like to better prepare students for the fall and because it leaves no room for low-effort projects or mistakes.\n \n Though the summer is often associated with fun and adventure, it should leave no room for procrastination, a monster that eats at your work ethic and feeds on laziness. By having teacher-designed summer projects as opposed to student-designed ones, this eliminates procrastination and cheating, room for error in grading and student confusion, and gives student's an opportunity to get a head start in the course and come into the fall with a foreknowledge of the course at hand.Â",

    ESSAY:
      "I personally think these summer projects should be student designed. Over the summer a student such as myself is so focused on vacation or summer activities we forget whats going on in school. We as students and growing teens need to keep our brains active and focus on education even if it is during the summer. Although teachers may need things to keep their brains or teaching skills active it is more important that the student knows given information due to the fact that teachers have already been through the school system. Over the summer I find myself getting very distracted and losing lots of information doing a project based on school related subjects can help me stay on track.\n \n When a student is on summer break or vacation the burden of school is lifted from their shoulders and their brains become less active. Students can go to bed later and hang out with friends more. These distractions can cause information gained during the school year. In my personal experiences with losing information I find myself learning simple concepts again taught to me the prior year. Keeping your brain active is one of the most important things that can be done by the student in school. Even though teachers need to do the same students are held more accountable.\n \n Even though retaining information can be difficult it must be done to obtain the greatest amount of success. This is exactly why a project can be so useful to keep information fresh in their minds. Growing teens need some type of mechanism to reserve and retain information. Teachers have already done this many times considering that they have been through high schoolÂ college and completed all the requirements of becoming a teacher.\n \n Also teachers have finished school they no longer need to do tasks such as projects. Though they also can lose information it is way less likely to happen. Teachers have already made their way through the education system. A project to them would be to easy and simply pointless. The said project could be made more difficult for the teachers to give them an actual challenge but overall teachers would easily surpass them.\n \n In conclusion I strongly think that students should be given a project to turn in the following year. Some teens just dont hold information as well and need something to keep their minds set on school subjects. Teachers would easily complete this task so I dont think the assignment should be necessary for them. Im sure almost any student can complete said project with ease as wellÂ due to the amount of time given.Â",

    ESSAY:
      "Most schools in the United States require students to complete a summer project. Projects are assigned over the summer to assure students are learning over the long break. Most students want to enjoy their break without any school workÂ and wait until the last week of summer break to complete summer projects. This is why summer projects should be student-designed. If summer projects are student-designed, students will be more creative, it gives students a senses of independence, and students will be able to explore areas of interest.\n \n However, some may disagree and say summer projects should be teacher-designed. They argue for this because if projects are student-designed they may off topic. This is a valid argument because it would make no sense if a student in a science class did a project about Fredrick Douglass. This could be avoided if teachers made guidelines for students to follow. Nevertheless, their are other view points to consider.\n \n On the other hand, if summer projects were student-designed they would be more creative. Students would not be restricted and could express themselves in unique ways. In the last few decades or so, the government has made standards for students to meet. With theses standards in places teachers have to follow a very strict curriculum. More than ever before, teachers are teaching to the test which limits student creativity. With student-designed summer projects, students can express their creativity which they are limited to in the school year.\n \n In addition, allowing summer projects to be student-designed would let students to feel independent. As most students are restricted during the school year to a classroom, allowing students to design their own projects could mean they go to a local park and explore their community. In Tara Westover's memoir\n \n Educated , as a young girl she did not explore her community as a child due to her parents beliefs. As she grew up she wanted to go to college and experienceÂ something new. When she went to college it was very rewarding. This is because she was not restricted any more. Allowing students to design their own project could be a very rewarding feeling for them because of the independenceÂ they gain through it.\n \n Finally, if summer projects were to be student-designed it would allow students to explore areas of interest that may not correlate to a specific subject in school. If a student wanted to do a project about fast fashion, it does not make sense to do it in a world history, algebra, biology or band class. That is why it is beneficial to students if they design their own summer project. A student-designed summer project allows students to research a topic they might not be able to do in their classes during the school year.\n \n To conclude, letting students to design their own summer project is beneficial in more than one way. Students will be able to show off creativity that they might not show off in school. Student-designed projects gives students a sense of independence because they are not being told what to do. It also allows student to explore topics that are not taught in school. Student-designed projects have many benefits and could even lead to a careerÂ path in the future.",

    ESSAY:
      "Sometimes over the summer, teachers will assign summer projects to students. This can put a damper on some students' summers and overall make them unhappy. However, if students were allowed to design their own summer projects it would improve upon their learning and enjoyment of their break.\n \n A lot of the time when students are assigned a project on something they don't know much about or aren't very interested in, they'll be less inclined to do the project. For example, in third grade, I entered the science fair. For the competition we were able to choose our topic rather than be assigned one. My partner and I were much more excited after finding out we could choose because that meant we would get to do our research on something we were interested and passionate about. Our passion drove us to get first place in the science fair. I don't think we would have worked as hard or been as diligent if we hadn't had the ability to choose. Another time I think of choice impacting achievement is in eighth grade. My English teacher conducted an experiment without telling any of her students. In the first quarter of the year she assigned us a paper that we could write about any topic of our choice. Later, in the third quarter, she assigned us a paper with a prompt. Even though we had learned more writing skills and were more skilled authors by the third quarter, most of the ESSAY scores from the first quarter were better. She said just by reading the two different ESSAYs you could tell which subjects students were passionate about, and the grades reflected that. If students were able to design their own projects, they would be able to choose their topics, therefore inciting passion and improving upon grades.\n \n The main reason teachers assign summer projects is to add on to students' learning, right? Well, a lot of the time, if students are not interested in what they're learning, they're less prone to absorbing the information. Taking it back to my third grade science fair, a lot of my peers did a topic that their parents chose for them. Without that passion or drive behind their work, many of them did not take in any of the information they put on their tri-fold. My partner and I on the other hand, were very interested in our topic and wanted to learn as much as we could about it so we worked and studied hard. To this day I could still tell you how to make the best all natural carpet cleaner, and it was because we got to choose what our project was about. A more recent example from my life is my grades in my junior year courses. I'm personally enrolled in four classes this year, the two I see the biggest difference in grade are my film class and my math class. Film is a topic that I'm very interested in and makes me very happy. Math on the contrary, not so much. The two classes are polar opposites in the realm of stress vs. enjoyment, and my grades reflect that. It may have something to do with the course rigor, but in my opinion it has everything to do with interest and motivation. I'm much more inclined to do a film project because it brings me happiness while also engaging me and helping me receive good grades. When I look at a math assignment I'm nowhere near motivated to do it, which in turn brings down my mood and my grade because I don't put my all into the subject. Therefore I don't take in any of the information, whereas in my film class I could write you a paper on everything that we've learned since day one. Such is true for a majority of students; where interest and enjoyment peaks, so does information intake.\n \n If you ask the average student what their favorite time of year is, they'll probably answer summer. No school, warm weather, free time, fun. But when there's a project lingering over their head that they have no choice over and no interest in, it can really throw a wrench in their mood and plans. An unhappy student brews an unhappy school year, and I'm sure no teachers want that. Upon talking with many of my peers, I've come to realize that a summer assignment with no choice and no fun involved immediately creates resentment and a general dislike towards the class and the teacher involved. If students are obligated to do an boring project where the teacher has put strict guidelines, they're going to walk into the class with a preconceived notion of a boring, uninteresting course. This is going to weaken classroom morale and overall diminish scores and productivity in the classroom. However, if students are able to create their own project and do something their passionate about in relation to a course they're taking, it will ultimately make them excited to be in the class and increase their ability to succeed. I remember in my chemistry class last year, I was able to make videos for my labs. It made me excited every day to attend my science class and increased my desire to learn about chemistry. With choice comes happiness, with a happy summer comes a happy new school year.\n \n When it comes to summer projects and assignments, choice is always the route to follow. With a student-created project, students are more driven, ascertain more information, and overall have a better summer, which leads to a better school year. By comparing grades from class to class, paper to paper, or even just asking a student, it's not hard to conclude that with the ability to choose comes success in school.Â",

      "Obtaining a strong and rich education is a very valuable thing that many children across the world have access to. The school year can be very stressful due to a variety of different things, but summer is the gem that motivates many students to move forward. This three month break gives students an opportunity to prepare for the next school year, but the rate of learning during this time decreases. In order to continue a learning at a constant rate, schools have introduced summer projects. These summer projects can be designed by teachers who are interested, but can also be designed by students. Summer projects should be student-designed, because it encourages teamwork and spurs motivation.\n \n Learning how to work with other individuals is an extremely important quality. A student-designed summer project will encourage kids to communicate with one another in order to satisfy the project requests of the students as a whole. Also, communication can spur relationships and bonding among individuals. Working with others and using teamwork to achieve a certain goal creates unity. Next, teamwork is not only seen in school, but also seen in the workplace. As adults, knowing how to work together and have good communication skills with others can make ones work atmosphere more enjoyable. For example: doctors have to work together everyday to save others through sharing their knowledge and conversing with one another. Lastly, teamwork can create a decrease in social anxiety and an increase in social skills. Many students experience social anxiety while meeting new people and having conversations with others. Although anxiety can not be fully defeated, teamwork helps push kids with social anxiety to make new friends and bonds. Having students design a summer project results in more unity among the student body, social structure, and life skills for the future.\n \n Summer is a very popular time of year that is beloved by many people, especially kids. A student-designed summer project makes the perception of schoolwork in the summer more enjoyable. Having fun while doing something increases the likelihood of continuing the behavior. If a student enjoys the project they are working on, they are more likely to complete it and submit quality work. On the other hand, if the project was teacher-designed, students would most likely find the topic boring, procrastinate, and submit a poor project. A student-designed project assures that it is a topic students find fun and is more enjoyable when compared to a topic selected by a teacher. Next, having students pick their own topic also holds them more accountable to complete their work without complaints. Students who tend to procrastinate may be more motivated to complete a project that they enjoy. An enjoyable project will motivate students to do well and will not decrease the level of happinessÂ they have throughout theÂ summer.\n \n The brain is an endless archive of knowledge and memories that is always eager to learn more. Actively learning throughout the summer increases education and pushes children further on the path to success. A student-designed summer project results in the formation of unity among the student body and creates a structured work ethic.Â",

      'There is a concern that students come back to schoolÂ not being ready to learn. Matter of fact, according to\n \n Generic_City Times, 88% of students coming back from summer break are not mentally ready for school. Students and their families take vacations to free their mind off of school/work. Being off for three months for vacations/ free time, can be difficult for the students, as they come back to school. Students come back "rusty"Â orÂ not ready, because their mind is still set on having a good time with friends and not doing any homework. To solve this problem (of students not being ready for school), school boards are deciding to require summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. The question the school board is asking is, should summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Summer projects should be designed by the student because students will pick a topic of interest, will not get a topic that they don\'t like, and teachers may give students challenging projects students are not capable of doing.\n \n Picking your own topic for a summer project can lead to better grades. According to "Academic Awards", students achieved better grades when they work on a subject of choice. A student said at the awards, "When I got to write about Hockey, which is my favorite sport, I put so much effort and time into my paper. I loved to write about how great of a game Hockey is. I truly believe that if you are allowed to write about a topic that you have true passion for, it will lead to great success. This aspect does not only apply to school work, but also the real world." There have been many studies on how "doing the thing you love" will bring you great success. That same aspect goes with school, students learn and perform better when they are learning a subject of interest.\n \n Normally, students do not like the topic of research a teacher assigns. People who went through school know that we have always had projects/ papers that do not fit our interest. Students slack on this aspect because they do not have true passion into what they are writing (not interested) or learning. One student from Generic_School states, "My true passion was history, I loved to write about the challenges, wars, and new changes of the world. I was looking forward to writing papers about history because this is the topic that ultimately interested me, but when I had to write about a science paper, I had absolute no interest writing about it. I would make up excuses to myself on why I shouldn\'t write this paper." Teachers teach about mandatory subjects that are either boring or not interesting. If summer assigned projects are brought to the attention, then teachers should not give out their own idea of what the student has to complete.\n \n Not only do teachers pick uninteresting topics to research about, but they also pick topics that may be to challenging for the writer to complete. Teachers give out topics of study that are challenging for the student to learn about and can bring a student down (not wanting to complete the assignment). A student from Generic_City said, "If I got a paper that was teacher-designed and difficult, I would not be up to do it. We already had to go through a whole school year doing what they teacher wanted us to do, why can\'t we choose our own topic for the summer?" If a student gets a topic from a teacher that is to hard for them to achieve during summer, then they will procrastinate to finish it. Teachers have the whole school year to give out challenging projects to students, but for summer projects, a student should not be assigned hard and rigorous work.\n \n Students should design their own summer projects because they will value their project more, won\'t get a bad topic (get to choose own topic), and don\'t have to deal with challenging topics teachers hand out. There have been many factors that have been in place to deal with students not coming mentally prepared on the first day of school. Should summer be shortened? Should schools give out homework for students to complete during the summer, so learning will be longer lasting? At the end of the day, no matter what the belief is about school work being done over the summer, student should be able to design and apply their own project.Â',

      "Most students don't enjoy getting projects assigned to them to complete over summer break. If students got the opportunity to design their own projects, it may be a more enjoyable experience for the student. Students tend to forget information they've learned during the school year once summer hits. A way a number of schools attempt to prevent this situation is simply assign projects for students to complete over break. Students should have the choice to design their own projects for summer break because they are more likely to complete a project on a topic they enjoy and they will have better time management.\n \n There is a higher chance of students completing an assignment if they enjoy the topic the assignment is based on. When trying to complete a project students have no interest in, often times the motivation factor runs low. Low motivation tends to lead to unfinished projects. There is a greater chance students will complete a project they've self-designed because they will most likely be more interested and better engaged in the topic they have chosen for themselves. For example, like reading a book, a person that does not enjoy reading has a higher chance of enjoying a book if it is based upon a topic they are interested in.\n \n With a self-designed project, students will obtain better time management. During the summer, many students tend to have a packed schedule. Therefore, causes students to not make time for projects assigned to them. Leading to why having students create their own project, follows with the task of the project being completed. Better time management has a great chance of leading to a completed project. For example, a student that is joyful about an assignment they have toÂ complete, will make time for the project. Students then will have no excuse on why they couldÂ notÂ complete their projects because they have the ability to design it in a way that fits their schedule.\n \n Overall, many students don't enjoy getting assigned projects to complete over summer break.

      "Summer projects are a great way to keep students learning over the summer. Some students may find them tedious, but they are actually very beneficial by keeping the students' minds working over their extended break. But, when teachers assign such projects, sometimesÂ they are not interesting nor engaging for the students. Thus, the interesting projects over summer break should be based on the student's interest in a subject, and not determined by a teacher, who may choose a topic that the student is not interested in.\n \n Often times during the school year, students take classes on subjects which they are not interested in in order to improve their college applications; this should not be the case for summer projects. The summer is a time for students to take a break from the rigorous math and English classes they took during the school year, and relax and do the things that they love. Therefore, to keep students engaged in their summer projects, they should determine what sort of work they do. For example, a person who has read all of the Percy Jackson novels would be very interested to learn about the classic Greek myths, and would greatly enjoy their spending a portion of their summer break reading Greek mythology. But if their English teacher assigned them a reading about the plight of the Native Americans, the student would likely not do the project until the last week of summer break, and would not retain any information and would receive a poor grade to start off the new school year. It is essential that a student researches what they like, and not something that is forced upon them by a previous teacher of theirs.\n \n At Generic_School, ninth-grade students were assigned a summer reading about the civil war, in which many students did not do, and thus started off the school year with a poor grade. They were not interested in the subject and thus did not want to waste a portion of their summer break doing something they do not enjoy. Some students did well on it, though, and that is where the issue is. An individual student would likely receive a grade for this project based on their interest in the subject, instead of their abilities as to do research and make a final product out of it. This is because those who were interested in the civil war or who had abundant previous knowledge of it would get a one-hundred percent on the project because they were either very interested in it or did not have to do any research to write the ESSAY. Those who were interested were motivated to learn about it and did lots of research. On the other hand, there were students who did not care for researching the Civil War as they did not find it interesting. Some of those students were the brightest in the class, and received a poor grade. The issue is that teacher-assigned summer projects cater to the interest of few, if any, of the students in a certain class, which causes grade discrepancies based on previous knowledge and interest, rather than ability to perform a task. Thus, if each student could choose their own topic to research over summer break and have the teacher approve it, there would be less unfair grade discrepancies between students of equal intelligence.\n \n Research projects are of the utmost importance in the later stages of student life, thus students should learn how to write a good paper early on in their careers, and there is no better way to do that than to have them research a topic they are intrigued by. As previously mentioned, many students who were not interested by the topics assigned by teachers would often times not do the project or do the whole thing the night before school starts, and thus start the year off with a horrible grade. There is a more long-term effect of this issue, though. summer projects are not assigned solely for the purpose of learning the material, teachers also want students to learn how to research effectively and write good ESSAYs. In order to do this most effectively, though, the students must have an interest in the topic, and if their topic is their choice, they will pick one that peaks their interest and will most likely perform better on it compared to a topic which they did not choose. This will improve their ESSAY writing and research abilities in the future, and help create a more interested and intelligent student body.\n \n To conclude, students who are required to complete summer projects should be allowed to choose the topic they will research over the summer. Summer break is a time for relaxation and fun for students, thus when they must work it should be interesting, and allowing students to choose their own topics for research would make each individual more involved in their work. The issue with teacher assigned summer projects is that they cause grade discrepancies between students of equal intelligence based on their previous knowledge of a subject. Grade discrepancies should derive from a student's ability to perform the task at hand, and not their previous knowledge or interest in the subject, and that is what happens with teacher-assigned summer projects. Finally, students develop research skills when they do well on a research project, and having students pick a topic interesting to them will increase their chances of doing well.",

      "Summer! Often described as a time to sit back and relax, a summer vacation can be seen as the antithesisÂ to any opportunity for learning. However, summer projects allow for learning to continue throughout the year. Summer projects should be student driven, due to the fact that they allow for self-motivation and individualism, as long as teachers are able to monitor the progress and quality of the work being done.\n \n A teacher-designed summer project does not allow for the same amount of individualism that could stem from a project designed by a student. Giving specific requirements for a summer project for an entire class of students will produce a number of cookie-cutter responses with no variety from student to student. This is because forcing students to fit into a mold limits any possible chance of self-expression. The entire point of creativity is to be outside of the norm, but that is impossible with a teacher-designed project, because 'the norm' is exactly what it is designed for.\n \n Furthermore, in a standard educational setting, students are not able to pick and choose what interests them, and this can lead to a lack of motivation during the normal school year. Finding a subject that one is passionate about is integral to continuing the joy of learning and of new discoveries that is so often lost in the later years of formal education. This is not anÂ issueÂ for student-designed summer projects.Â Allowing students to pick what interests them for a summer project would solve this issue. With no parameters set by teachers, the educational possibilities are endless for a student.\n \n However, regardless of how much a student is willing to learn on their own during summer vacation with a student-based project, teachers still have their place in this system. Checks and balances are necessary for any system like this to function, and summer projects are no different. Some parametersÂ for these summer projects should be set by teachers. Otherwise, there is no way to ensure that actual learning is taking place during what is supposed to be a learning experience. Teachers also need to have the ability to grade any given project, which would be difficult to do objectively if no parameters were given to the projects.\n \n Learning does not stop at the end of high school, and it certainly does not stop at the end of a school year. Student-designed projects allow for creativity and individualism from each and every student, and allowing teachers to have a guiding-but not controlling-hand in the projects can lead to fantastic academic results.Â",

      "Did you know the 75% of high school studentsÂ do their summer assignments in the last week of the summer. Some even do it in the first week of school. This percent would decrease if the students projects were self chosen. It would help them by giving them the choice of doing what they want to do. They would be able to be more creative, be able to do it faster so they can enjoy their summer and some families money is a struggle and they can't afford the teacher directed projects so they can do what works for them.\n \n When a project is student directed they have the freedom to do what they want and be creative with it and actually enjoy doing the project. I have had hundreds of projects in my eleven years of schooling and some of my favorite ones were in my cooking class last year. My favorite one in that class was a food truck project. My teacher said you have to make a cardboard box food truck, make a menu, and make one item on the menu. Otherwise we were free to do what we wanted. I ended up making some really good food because she said just do what you want. I alsoÂ ended up getting a good grade because I could be creative on that project.\n \n One major problem with summer assignments is that students either forget about them and don't do them or they pushÂ them off until the last minute. I am one of those students that procrastinates until the last minute to do my AP summer assignments. It makes it very challenging to do them when there is only one week in summer left and I want to have fun and enjoy the last parts of the summer. I have friends that are worse than me and either don't do the AP work at all or they do them at the beginning of the school year, but if they were self chosen they would not have the issue of not wanting to do them because they can do what ever they want and make it what they feel is good.\n \n My final reason is more on the extreme side but I have seen it happen. It is where the teachers summer work is a large project that is simple but costly and some families that I have seen do not have enough money to do the project. They normally end up failing the project because they never did the work, but if they could do what they want for it they could've passed. Where if they were short on money and it was limiting them on what they could do if they needed to they could do a less expensive project and save their money for other things.\n \n There are many other reasons that students should be able to do their own thing for their projects over the summer but here are just a few of the reasons that people say that they should remain teacher directed. It's that it is a lot easier for the teacher to grade based on what they are looking for because they can grade on their scale of how close it is to what they want. But when it is student choice they can be creative and have fun, the project can go faster and they can enjoy their summer for what is it and it can be more cost effective for the families that have lower incomes.",

    ESSAY:
      'Summer projects should be student-designed as long as the teacher is still in control of the overall process. This system engages the students more, while also ensuring that they continue to learn over the break.\n \n As a rule, students are more likely to complete an assignment and enjoy doing so if they have control over the parameters of the assignment. If a student is interested in a certain field of study, they should be able to freely explore and learn about it. Designing their own assignment would allow them to do this. For example, one student might be fascinated with astronomy and another student with biology. Allowing them to create their own projects to study these fields would pique their interest in learning and may also help them understand which career field might suit them best.\n \n However, with a student-designed project, it is possible that the student will "slack off" and design a project that does not truly benefit their learning. For example, a student might design a science experiment that with the research question of "what is the effect of temperature on ice?" Although this question sounds valid, it is not since it is easily answered. Most people already know that ice melts as the temperature increases. Therefore, the student will not have to put in much effort or even conduct the experiment in order to know the outcome.\n \n In order to prevent this from happening, teachers should supervise the designing of these projects. This can be done before the students leave school for the summer or the students can submit project proposals to the teacher over the summer. If teachers do this, they will be able to verify that their students\' projects are possible and refine them. Often times, students have good ideas, but do not know how to execute them or are unable to because they do not have the necessary resources. Teachers will also be able to catch the projects that are too "obvious" or easy.\n \n Although student-designed projects can go awry, they can also be very successful if they are created with the guidance of a teacher. Students should be given every opportunity to learn on their own and explore their individual passions.Â Â Â Â',

    ESSAY:
      "Over the summer, many student spend their time doing nothing to keep their minds active and engaged in education. Many schools and teachers want children to continue creating learning experiences and mentally developing over the summer. One way they can do this is to assign a summer project for a student. While many of these projects might be created and outlined by the teacher, I personally think that Students should design and create their own individual projects because it would help them to grow as independent learners, it would allow them to create something that they would be enthusiastic about and would put more effort into. and it would also help the teacher see more clearly how effectively a student is progressing as a learner.\n \n One important reason that summer projects should be student designed is the fact that creating a whole project from scratch would help a child to become a far more independent learner, and would prepare them for their later stages in life. When a student reaches college, it would be pretty overwhelming for them to have to take a bunch of classes that were all almost completely independent if they had never been given the opportunity to grow in their independence as a person in middle or high school. A student designed project might be quite scary for many students, but I think that it is definitely necessary in order to be set up for long term success in their personal endeavors throughout their later years in education, as well as their career afterwards. Many jobs are highly independent and require for somebody to be diligent in their own efforts. For example, my dad is an engineer, and he has deadlines that are agreed on by him and the people that pay him for completing work for them, and if he doesnt meet a deadline, the client would most likely not be happy and never come back to get more work done from him.\n \n Another big reason that summer projects should be student made is that it would allow for students to be more creative, and work on something that they are very enthusiastic about, which would in turn make it easier for the student to work hard and do well on the project. If a student is assigned a topic that they completely hate, they would be extremely unenthusiastic about the project, and would definitely not want to work on it, especially during the summer months, when there are so many other things they would rather be doing. It would probably lead to procrastination on a project that would leave a student with not enough time to properly do the project to the best of their abilities. A project that a student is enthusiastic about could also lead to a student feeling confident in their abilities, and they would be encouraged to try their best and do well throughout the year to keep their positive momentum flowing.\n \n It would also be extremely helpful for a teacher to be able to see how a student is functioning and is progressing on their own terms. At the end of the day, the teachers job is to guide and lead us until we are independent enough to thrive on our own. If the projects were self designed, it would be an extremely helpful tool for future teachers to look back on and guage how much work a student needs on their independence journey before they can leave without facing struggle or uncertainty throughout their life. These self designed projects would help a teacher to clearly see each level of assistance needed by each and every student.\n \n All of these reasons that argue that projects should be student designed revolve around one thing: independence. I think that independence is the single most important thing that you have to prepare for in order to be ready for college. If a student was not independent in college, they would flounder around without being able to properly learn and develop the skills they need to succeed after college. Middle and High schools need to take steps towards challenging their students with independence to create self-sustaining, educated people that can truly help to make a positive difference throughout their communities and make the world a better place.",

      "Generic_Name\n \n Are take home projects for students over summer vacation necessary? Yes, students should be given some sort of summer project that corresponds with their class for the following year. students spend roughly eight months in school and once summer comes all the academic knowledge they acquired over the school year is lost the day they walk out the school doors. students should stay in some sort of school environment so they do not fall behind or lose as much prior knowledge about the subject. students could connect with their teachers for the next academic school year and receive their project from them, to turn in the first week of school.\n \n Many students need the extra summer project to keep them in the flow of things. Some students don't need the extra project they are always in a school mindset and keep there grades up. However, that is not the case for every individual student. A summer project would be no ones favorite summer activity but, it would benefit students for their next academic school year. therefore, students would already be in school mode and be more prepared and less likely to fail a semester due to lack of knowledge.\n \n Students should be able to come up with their own creative idea whether it be for a science project or an English ESSAY. Student would be more prone to do their work if they could do their own topic. Students would do topics that they are interested in, maybe a sport they play or the history of a vehicle they like. But, when students receive a prompt or a project of any kind they are not as interested as they could be if it was their own topic. The topics could be submitted to the students teachers to be approved prior to summer and starting the work.\n \n It is necessary for students to receive a take home project or ESSAY over the summer. It will keep students on their feet and in a school like environment. It will also build responsibility, and let your teachers know how dedicated you are to school or how important it is to you. Students would also have something to do over the summer, because most students sit around at home and do nothing but play video games and watch television. So yes, schools should send home summer projects and the students should be able to make a creative topic with his or her teachers approval.",

      "As the school year ends and summer break begins, many students cease to learn or do any education-related activities. Some schools require their students to complete summer projects to assure that the students continue to learn over the duration of their three-month summer break; however, there has been an ongoing debate on whether these summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Those who disagree state that these summer projects should be designed by the teachers, but this not true. Although some may disagree, the summer projects that some schools are requiring students to complete should be student-designed.\n \n There are a variety of reasons that the summer projects that some schools are requiring students to complete should be student-designed. One reason that these projects should be designed by the students is that by allowing students to design their own projects, the students are able to demonstrate their ambiguity. For example, a student may have interests in a particular subject and may do a project that is displayed through an ambiguous media platform. That project format would not be able to be displayed if the projects were designed by the teachers. Another reason that these projects should be designed by the students is that by allowing students to design their own projects, the students are able to be creative with their projects. A student may want to be creative and show their ability to carve marble statues, or their ability to do ventriloquism. In another instance, a student may want to be creative with their project topic and may want to conduct research on a rarely known species of insects that they learned about while visiting South America during their summer vacation. In addition to the aforementioned reasons, students should be able to design their own projects because it allows students to learn more about a topic that interests them. A teacher designed project may inquire about a student's knowledge of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus or Newton's Laws; however, these topics wouldn't interest many students and the amount of precision and thought put into the projects would be lackluster. By allowing a student to control their project's topic, the teachers are giving the students freedom to roam and think about what they are going to learn about.\n \n There are further reasons that the summer projects that some schools are requiring students to complete should be student-designed. When a teacher allows a student to choose a topic for a project, it allows the teachers to understand a student's level of learning, as well as a student's level of thinking. Most students will be appreciative of the fact that they're able to conduct a project of their choice and will give their best effort while completing the project. As a teacher grades a student's project, that teacher is able to gauge what the student was thinking as they created their project. Another reason that these projects should be designed by the students is that when a student is given the freedom to conduct their own research for a project topic, that student is able to give a demonstration of their innovation. Many students have strong innovation skills, but during the school year they are assigned different assignments that prohibit students from using their innovative nature. For example, if a student has an interest in airplanes, they may want to do a project pertaining to airplanes; teacher-designed projects would not allow a student to explore this area of innovation within themselves, which may cause them to lose interest in the topic. One more reason that the projects should be student-designed is that by conducting one's own research and designing one's own project, a student may explore new topics that may peak their interest. For example, while researching the hardships and difficulties of underwater welding, a student may learn about another profession that they did not know existed. This simple occurrence may sway a multitude of that student's life choices: which major they will pursue in college, which profession they may want to pursue after college, or if that student may still want to go to college after high school instead of going to a trade school.\n \n Although some may disagree, the summer projects that some schools are requiring students to complete should be student-designed. Those who disagree state that the summer projects that some schools are requiring students to complete should be teacher-designed, but there are a plethora of reasons that this is false. These projects should be student-designed for a multitude of reasons: students are able to be more creative and ambiguous when choosing their own project design, students are able to be more innovative when choosing their own project design, students are given the opportunity to learn about new topics, and when students are given the chance to design their own project, teachers are able to gauge students' thinking and cognitive skills levels. By allowing a student to design their own project, that student is bound to become a more independent thinker and innovator; thus, creating a brighter future for the generations to come.",

    ESSAY:
      "When summer finally begins, the last thing a student even considers thinking about is anything that is school related. The infamous summer project stands to change that. This topic, the summer project, coupled with my predetermined ideologies to what summer should represent lead me to the conclusion that if summer projects are to be a requirement for students, they should be designed by the student, for the student. The reasons students should have the right to design their own projects include, but are not limited to, the fact that giving students a say would let them express, and learn about, themselves creatively, the fact that students can make something they are passionate about, and the idea that summer is not a time to be doing school work.\n \n If students acquire the right to design their own summer projects, they would most likely make the project in a manner that would be both fun and educational at the same time. This is exactly what I did in the 10th grade, when I was assigned a video project in the class Driver's Education. I had never recorded a video for school purposes, and I never learned to edit either. The video project made learning to edit a necessity. I not only learned how to edit because of the video, but I also learned that making and editing videos can be extremely fun! It showed me that I love to make people laugh, and honestly, I may want to pursue making and editing videos one day. Students could choose a video project, or any other way to channel their creativity through this project. In doing so, in choosing how the project is designed, they may learn something new about themselves, and it gives students a chance to show, or maybe even find, their creative side.\n \n By giving students the right to design their own summer projects, you are giving students the chance to make something with the passions they have. This would have an extremely positive effect, as they would now be working on the project with an unconventional mindset, at least in the context of school work. This change in their mindset would make it easier for the project to be done, as the unique things each student loves are being incorporated. This would also drastically increase the quality of work, as they are doing something they love. Allowing students to incorporate their passions would also show teachers how each student is unique in their own way. Student designed summer projects may also create a new interest for whatever topic the project is on, as students would be more inclined to make a cocktail of their interests and school-related topics rather than isolating the two.\n \n Over the 10 months that make up the school year, students are in a constant state of stress, due in part by the work that they must do. Summer is a time for students to unwind, and to forget what it means to be a stressed out, overworked, and sleep deprived student. A time to relax. A time, for once in a student's life, to put the work, and the stress that comes with it, down for an extended period of time. If students are to be required to complete a summer project, they should, at the very least, have a choice in how they will design said project. As it will ease the sting of having to do school work in a time where no school work should be done in the first place. One may say, \"Anytime is a time to do school work!\" And while I see where they are coming from, school is out of session for a reason. Summer vacation is a time to be away from school and all of the psychological endeavors it brings with it. Which is why I know, definitively, that school work should not be issued out during the summer in the first place, and because of this, if school work is to be issued, the school, at the very least, should give the students the right to design their summer projects.\n \n In conclusion, students, without a shadow of a doubt, should be given the right to design their summer projects. Through designing their summer projects, students can learn about who they are creatively, they can incorporate what they are passionate about into the summer project, and finally, students can feel better about having to do a project during the summer, as they will at least have a choice in what that project is. All of these benefits are extremely valuable, as they will have a positive effect towards a student's life, as they can learn new things about themselves, and show people a bit of who they are. These positive effects would be an impossibility if the flexibility that comes from giving students the right to design their summer projects is not given in the first place. Â Â Â  Â Â Â",

      "Most students try their best to avoid learning over the summer. As a result, they forget the knowledge they learned in the prior school year and aren't prepared for the upcoming school year. To get used to learning again, student's brains need to be refreshed and stimulated in the beginning of every school year.\n \n As an attempt to solve this problem, teachers assign summer projects. Students, often times, despise these projects because they are boring and stressful. However, these projects are neccessary because they ensure students don't forget about school. To make the projects more enjoyable for students, they should design the projects instead of teachers. Student-designed projects would be better because they focus on their interests, have higher quality, and be less stressful.\n \n In most cases, students don't find school work interesting because the topics aren't based around things students care about. Students get tired of learning about the same meaningless things that have no value in their lives. The things they are taught in school can't be applied to the real world and are based around a broken system that focuses on grades and memorization, not learing. Student-designed projects would focus on their interests. Students would actually want to learn compared to falling asleep in their history class listening to something that happened 900 years ago. Students could assign themselves a project based on a book they enjoy or a phenonom they find mysterious. Students would work and have fun doing it. The projects would still be educational and purposeful, but students wouldn't feel forced to do it.\n \n It is a known fact that if people love what they do, they will put more effort into it. When people don't enjoy their work, they don't care as much and don't try as hard. This concept can be applied to student-designed projects. For once, students would be excited to work and learn because they get the chance to do something their passionate about. Students would put more effort into their projects. As a result, their quality of work and overall project would be much better compared to if they had to work on a teacher-designed project. They would get higher grades and teachers would be impressed with their work.\n \n School is extremely stressful for students throughout the school year. The workload is intense and hard to manage. Teachers give difficult test and assign massive piles of homework that students have to complete for typically seven classes. Students feel pressure to attain good grades. This can lead to terrible sleep patterns, mental breakdowns, and anxiety attacks. Outside factors can also add to their stress. Students have to deal with their social and family problems, which can be emotionally traumatizing. Students also partake in clubs and sports or have jobs that just add to their workload. Summer is a much needed break for students because they can escape from the stress that the school year brings. On their break, the last thing students want is another stressful project. Student-designed projects would reduce their stress significantly. They wouldn't feel as much pressure to meet their teachers standards and would wouldn't procrastinate as much. Student-designed projects would encourage learning for students without incorporating the factor of stress that comes along with school work.\n \n Some might say that student-designed projects wouldn't focus on real topics or be taken seriously by the students. However, teachers could approve the designs to make sure they are educational. Teachers can also grade the projects like teacher-designed projects to make sure students don't blow the project off. Students will enjoy these projects much more because they can have fun with it. These projects will also help them learn over the summer break and prepare them for the school year. Student-designed projects are much better than teacher-designed projects because they focus on the students interests, increase their quality of work, and take away stress. Student-designed summer break projects should be implemented into more school systems around America.Â  Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â  Â Â Â Â",

      "Many schools require students to do projects in the summer. These projects can be designed by teachers or students. The projects are created so the student can continue to learn over their break; but can become a problem if the student doesn't like the type of project given to them by the teacher. This is why students should be able to design their own projects. Students should be able to design their own project because they will be able to be more creative and comfortable; but teachers should design the project simply because the teacher is more knowledgeable than the student when it comes to the topic.\n \n First, when students can design their own project, they will be more creative and will be more likely to show what they know. The student being more creative on their project will show that that they understand the topic and don't have to follow a simple and easy format. For example, personally, I have had summer projects like my \"Of mice of men\" book project that was just flat out boring and not fun because the teacher gave us no room to be creative in anyway. Many students want to be creative with their projects, but when the project doesn't look appealing or will not let us be creative, we don't get a very good chance to show what we know. Then compared to my personal reading book project, where I had the freedom of being able to be creative and could show my understanding of the book. It showed the difference between being able to designing your own project or being given a teacher designed, simple project.\n \n Furthermore, personally, when a teacher has given me a specific format; there is the feeling of uneasy because I feel if I don't follow the format, the project will be completely wrong. This example doesn't let the student feel comfortable and makes the student feel that they can't be creative in their own way. When a student gets the chance to design their own projects, the students will naturally be more comfortable. This can be shown by the students work and effort put into their projects. Being comfortable with a project for the students is a big deal because if the students don't feel comfortable, how will the students show what they have learned during their projects. A student designed project helps because it is based off of what they want to do and not something they were given.\n \n Although, when the teachers design the projects, the teachers will know more on the topic rather than the students. This can make it to where the teachers specifically designs the projects to the topic of choice. Since the teachers design the projects, they can create and use different kinds of formats. The teachers can also choose the type of projects the students can use. This can and will give the students more options on their projects than just one, and the students can choose the type of projects based on their strengths and weaknesses. Since the teachers know more on the topic of the projects they can use that to be creative themselves by designing a project for the students that isn't something most of the students have seen before.\n \n In conclusion, since many schools require students to do projects over the course of summer. Students should be able to design their own projects based off of them being able to be more creative and being more comfortable; but teachers should design the projects simply because the teacher is more knowledgeable than the student on the topic. Work shows when a student is comfortable with their project. When they're comfortable the can aslo become more creative. After all of these statements and supporting evidence this is why students should be able to design their own summer projects.",

      "Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Summer projects should be student-designed to keep it simple. Teacher-designed projects are usually time consuming, boring, and complicated. The summer projects should be fun, easy, and less time consuming for students. Students wouldn't want to do a project that could take up their entire summer break; they don't deserve it. The summer projects should be student-designed because they are able to decide how much time they want to spend on it and how easy or creative they want it to be.\n \n Summer break is the time students are off from school. If they were to have teacher-designed projects, it'll make them feel like their still in school. Students are supposed to enjoy summer break, not be focused on a project given by a teacher that could stress them out. Most times, students don't do the project at all for reasons like: \" Oh it's boring\", \" I didn't have time\", \" I couldn't understand it\", or \" It's too much work\". Teacher-designed projects are not right for students, especially since it's over the summer.\n \n Student-designed projects will allow students to have an enjoyable summer. If they create their own project, they have control on what they do. Students will still be learning by themselves with what they decide to create. If the student does not want to spend the whole summer working on the project, it will be okay because they're the one making the decisions. The students can make their project easy and fun with things like: Colors, Pictures, and Glitter. Students will be able to enjoy their summer break because their project will be fun and easy for them.\n \n Everyone has their own opinion for these two choices. If it were to be discussed by teachers only, they would most likely choose teacher-designed projects. If it were to be discussedÂ by students only, they would most definitely choose students-designed projects. Between teachers and students discussing it, it would basically be a 50/50, but the teachers should really give students the chance to create something and learn on their own.

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects as a way to make sure they are still learning during their time off. To some students this sounds not ideal because if their getting a break from school then why would they want still be responsible for school work. While others may like keeping their mind stimulated while they are on break. Even in both cases the projects being required should be able to be student-designedÂ projects. Most students like having a choice of assignments or work so they can pick whats best suited for them and their strengths. The student-design offers more to the student then the teacher-design because the students are the ones who have the greater idea on what they are doing. Student-designed projects would get the students more interested in the projects which then more students would complete the assignment in its entirety.\n \n Being interested in a particular subject or idea would most likely increase the effort and time you put in to what pertains to the subject. Even thought its during the summer more students would completeÂ a assignment that appeals to their interests rather then a standard project that teachers have assigned for years. For example if a student who likes Rap or Hip-Hop music is assigned to a research paper about all the major wars that the United States fought in they might not feel an appeal to do the project or at least not put in a lotÂ of effort in ; if that same student was allowed to research the same topic but create is own song or rap about it would increase the interest about the project and the effort put in. There would be guidelines and rules about how the student can complete the assignment and the subject matter but as a overall the project would be student design based. Although some students might not have a preference on any type of assignment or if the teacher assigns everyone one universal project most would use their interest to create a project they would enjoy doing. Letting student summer projects be student-design would increase the interest in the project.\n \n Students are going to to what they want in most cases so making the summer projects student design based will help have larger completion rate of projects. If what a student is being told to do is not something they agree with they will most likely not do it or turn it in or halfway complete it so it is not to its full potential. However if a choice is given or if the project is student design based it will more likely get done and done well. As an example if the teacher design based project was a four page paper then more then likely people are not going to do it because writing is not their personal strong suit, but if their was a choice of a four minute video project about the same same topic it gives student who have different abilities to excel just as much as others in their own personal way. While the student design will increase the amount of students who do the project their will always be students who just don't do it but at least for the students who do it,Â a bigger outlet is givenÂ so they can complete it in a way they they can understand or what they excel in. The student design gives student a bigger window so it can help them complete the assignment and have it done well.\n \n Student-designed projects would get the students more interested in the projects which then more students would complete the assignment in its entirety. The projects assigned are ultimately for the benefit of the student in the long run so having the assignment be student based would greater benefit the student. Some think that since the teachers are mastered in their subject matter it should be a teacher design based project but then the student might feel smothered or boxed in by how they feel about the whole project in general which would be doingÂ the opposite of benefiting the student. A student design based project would be the best way for the student so succeed.Â  Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

      "School is stressful. Not only during the school year but now during the summer. From extracurricular activities to preparing for the upcoming year, the summer can also be a time of stress. Students from all over America are forced to participate in summer projects designed to reinforce the information they learned during the school year. While this idea makes perfect sense, one must evaluate how these projects are designed. Summer projects should be student designed because this can improve creativity and eliminate stress; although one could argue that eliminating structure would result in a poor learning opportunity, teachers must think positively about every student's potential.\n \n In school, almost every project is teacher-designed. This occurs so that teachers can assess a set of skills a student can perform. However, implementing a student-designed project would help students find their true passion in a field and help them become more creative individuals. For instance, when a student is forced to create a science experiment on a specific wild plant, there is no creativity involved in selecting what to study. However, if a student could choose which plant to study and what experiment to do, it could improve a student's creative thinking skills. This student-designed project would also help students find their passion for science by having them discover a plant that truly interests them. Summer projects should be student-designed because of the increased creativity and innovation when students can choose what to study.\n \n Nowadays, stress is apparent with almost every student. The stress of pleasing teachers is often what forces students into a hatred towards school. When a teacher designs a project for a student to complete, it can turn a potentially fun learning opportunity into a dreadful and stressful assignment. For instance, if a student is forced to complete a history project on Abraham Lincoln, a student may see this as just another thing to be completed. However, if a student is given the opportunity to complete a history project on any president, he/she may find it entertaining to research one of their favorite people in history. This can greatly benefit the student because many students learn best when they are not stressed out about a specific goal. The lack of stress causes them to have a relaxed time while still obtaining valuable knowledge.\n \n While summer projects are valuable to ensure that students have retained information, they should not be teacher-designed. The summer should be a time where students can choose what to work on in order for them to truly find their passion. This can help to improve a student's creativity by allowing them to participate in an activity they are truly interested in. Similarly, this can help a student to eliminate stress by finding enjoyment in their project.Â",

      "Summer is a time for students to take the stress off of school and to have fun with their friends. Some schools think kids should still have projects throughout the summer to continue their learning. Each school is different, some schools have the teachers come up with the project, while others lets the students make it. Schools should have teacher-designed projects for the summer because it would get students ready for what they will learn that year, teachers could count it as a grade once school starts, and it would be an easy project that would not take too long to do.\n \n If a teachers got to come up with the project they make it on the one of the topics the students would learn that year. They know what they will be teaching, so they would make the projects on specific units to prepare you for the class. Doing this is great because it will get the students ready and interested into the subject early on. This will help the students for when they start school they will already know a littleÂ about the topic. The more students know to start with the better they might do in the class.\n \n Another great thing is if the teacher designed the project, then they could count the project as a grade to get the school year started. This is good because right off the bat the student could have a good grade if they do the project correctly. Knowing this more people, for sure, would do the project. Starting the year off with a good grade can help benefit you later on, if you start to struggle a little bit. The project would be easy, so it would be easy to get a good grade, which is a great way to start a school year with. The more students doing the project, the more students you will have thinking and getting involved in school during the summer.\n \n The teachers would make it a fairly easy project that would not take the whole summer to do. Summer is the teachers vacations as well, and they know as much as the kids do that they want to relax. Lots of kids travel and hangout with friends during summer and teachers know that, so they would make it a pretty fair and easy project. Doing projects like these kids get more involved and excited to do them. If teachers did a simple, and maybe even a little fun, project it would keep the kids thinking and yet not stressed out.\n \n Some might say that the students should design the project. They think this because they say the students could make it their own and they would be more interested if they got to choice what they wanted to do. Although some people say that, if a student got to choice their topic or how they want to do their project they would do it too easy for themselves. Summer projects should be designed by the teachers because it would be on a subject they will learn later that year, the teachers could count it as a grade, and they would make it a simple and fun project to do. Everyone benefits more if the teachers made the projects rather than the students.Â",

      "Imagine summer break coming to an end you would want to make memories with friends and family, but you can't because you have to do your summer project. When it comes to summer assignments many students will put it off until the last moment. They will do this for a number of reasons maybe they were on vacation, had trouble with their family, or just didn't like the assignment. Regardless of the reason in the last moments of summer they must rush to complete this assignment for the next school year. Summer projects should be student-designed because of students interest, schedules, and emotional health.\n \n Summer assignments should be student-designed because of different students interest. Some students may be interested in math while others might like scienceÂ or history more. If a student likes math but is required to do a history summer assignment they will not want to do it because they are not motivated to do something they do not like. Some may say that regardless of what classes students like they will do the assignment anyways because they have to. While that is true it would be better to let the students choose what they want instead of trying to force them to continue learning over summer break.\n \n Students schedules are not always as simple as teachers think so giving a lot of work to do over the summer might not be best for them. Students have a lot going on in their daily lives spending time with friends, sports, religion, and family emergencies. These are some things that constantly impact students lives on a daily basis, and if they are dealing with a lot over the summer they might have difficulties finding time to do the assignments teachers give them. Although most students have a lot going on so it not a valid reason for students to put off their work or not do it. However students know their schedule better than teachers they could design a project that they could fit into their schedules and complete on time.\n \n Students in their teens or lower are often feeling many emotions through the year but teachers probably don't think about that as they assign summer projects. A student getting a projectÂ they don't think they can handle while they are dealing with a lot at home could push them to make a bad decision like doing drugs or getting in a fight. Students could be feeling stressed, angry, or sad and getting an assignment they might not think they can handle could make them act out in unpredictable ways. Some may say that getting a project has no impact on a students emotion health. However the fact is all students have different conditions that they live or grew up in so when teachers assign projects they can't assume that all students are fine. If students could chose their own summer assignments they could chose something that would not feel so overwhelming to them.\n \n The whole point of summer break is so students get a chance to relax and prepare themselves for the next school year. While it is important for students to do a little work so they don't forget what they have learned so far, teachers should not force the work on them and they should not feel like it is too much to handle. In the past teachers designed the summer projects and students just had to deal with it but that system is flawed. Does it really help students review what they have already learned? What's to stop them from copying the assignment from a friend. Going forward students should have the choice to design their own summer project with the help of a teacher. While it is best for them to feel comfortable and want to keep learning over the summer teachers need to make sure that it covers the right material and that it is not too easy.",

    ESSAY:
      "Since the birth of the internet and social media, the world has shifted to greatly favor the innovators and the free-thinkers. Society no longer demands students to find one subject they are good at, go to college to study that subject, and then get a middle class job in that field. While performing one skill at a very high level still holds value, the most successful people are those who can think ahead of the curve, those who can think of the next Amazon, the next Netflix, the next Uber, the next big thing. So, how does that relate to whether we have student-designed or teacher-designed summer school projects? Well, letting students design their own projects gives them more freedom, allowing them to think outside the box, which aids the development of valuable skills that are applicable in the real world. Instead of teaching students how to follow directions on a rubric, we should be teaching them to think creatively and how to collaborate with one another.\n \n Allowing students to design their own projects gives them far more freedom than a teacher-designed project ever could. Keeping students on a leash forces them to wear a one size fits all education. Each student is different; they all have different strengths, different weaknesses, different motivations, and different goals. That is why we need to give them tailored education. Giving students this freedom would allow them to create a project that works well for them, and more importantly on a topic they are actually interested in. If we let students do a topic they enjoy, the results will be far better compared to when they are forced to learn about something they have no long termÂ interest in. The freedom students gain from designing their own projects is far more valuable than just following the directions their teachers gave them.\n \n Making students design their own projects encourages them to learn how to think creatively. Arguably, the most valuable skill in today's society is the ability to be able to bring a new unique perspective and thought process to any discussion. That is not a skill that can be obtained by constantly being told what to do and how to do it. Students need to learn for themselves how to go to the drawing board, find out which ideas are bad, which ones are good, and then create a plan to execute the good ones. That is not something that can be spoon fed in the classroom. That's why student designed summer projects are the perfect opportunity for schools to do their part in teaching students how to think creatively.\n \n When forced to come up with their own ideas and think creatively students will develop and enhance skills they would have never had the teacher been the one designing the project. For example, if it is a partner project these two students will have to learn how to collaborate together to design a project, designate jobs to each other, and hold each other accountable for their share of the work. That kind of collaboration never would have occurred had the teacher done all that for them. When students go on to college and into their professional career they will have to learn skills like collaboration, because they won't have someone doing it for them. That is why it is important we take the time to prepare them for than now.\n \n A wise man once said, \"don't follow where the path may lead, but go where there is no path and leave a trail.\" I believe that quote perfectly represents how we want our students to think. The skills developed through out of the box thinking which can be achieved by allowing students the freedom to design their own projects is far more valuable out in the real world then anything the teacher could prepare.Â  Â Â",

      "Summer Projects\n \n Summer projects, as a student i'm not a big fan. But in the case of this argument, I don't have a preferred side. Either way these projects stress you out on a break made for not having stress. I will not say they are a good or a bad thing because there are so many pros and cons it'd be hard to really choose. But I guess I have to in order to pass.\n \n To start, I'm going to list some pros and cons of these projects then i'll pick a side. Lets start with pros. Summer projects, if done correctly provide some sort of education during the off school season. But usually when they are designed by teachers. Cons, there are a lot, and I have a student perspective so it makes sense. When a teacher makes the project, it requires me to actually use my brain. Summer projects takes time and energy from me. They take away time from my job that I could be out making money. So that is a pretty big con.\n \n Since I have to choose, If anyone was going to design the summer project it has to be the teacher. They understand the curriculumÂ and how to apply it to students. Yea, it'd be awesome if students did it. Then there would be a lot less work to it. Personally it's hard to think of a reason to where a student would want to design it other than personal benefit. I'm not saying that all students would do that. But a large majority would. Students wouldnt even know where to start. They would make up some fake assignment that would take like 10 minuets to complete. Which is great and all but there would be no information transmitted over the course of the summer.\n \n Honestly how can students design a project on information that they don't fully understand. That would be chaos. I understand why summer projects are in place. But if i'm going to be completely honest here, I don't want some kid designing what my task to do over the summer is. I see two things happening, that person will be my best friend or I'd hate their guts. There is not much more to be said in this argument. Hands down, with out a doubt teachers should design the summer projects.",

      "A student's life should be lived by a student's choice. While there are a select handful of students who yearn to increase their knowledge day in and day out at school, the majority despise it. Due to the lack of free time students are left with after their school day, weekends and breaks are their knights in shining armor that will save them from the prison they call school. One of the breaks most looked foward to is summer break. This three month halt in tests, note taking and projects is sheer paradise in the eyes of students. However, some deem it neccessary to continue the assigned curriculum into this break to ensure the adherence of crucial knowledge to the students' brain. With that being said, these summer projects should be devised in a manner that will benefit both the teacher and the student to the maximum. And so, to assure their continued learning during their break, summer projects should be student-designed rather than teacher-designed in order to maximize productivity, to enhance their leadership skills and to allow for students to enjoy their project, and hence, giving them a break.\n \n The majority of students innately have a distaste for following directions and taking orders from higher authorities. As a result, when students are constantly ordered to work on numerous projects throughout the year, they will complete it with reluctance. Furthermore, their lack of desire to complete this project will lead to a lack of favorable content, meaning the students will not complete it to the best of their ability. While the teacher may need to put forth guidelines, in order to prevent the students intentionally procrastinating their assignment and turning in mediocre work, the students should be able to partially lead the prompt for the project. When the students are presented with a project they find interesting they will be eager to present their optimal work despite the activities they may be doing during the break.\n \n Taking leadership and making self-guided decisions are skills that students must acquire at an early age in order to succeed later on in life. Although the teacher may portray a leadership role in the classroom, it is quite difficult for the students to replicate the actions they see until they are given the chance. Allowing for students to make the decision on how they will plan their summer project gives them this chance. Simliar to a teacher constructing her lessons, with a student-designed summer project, the students will have to form an agenda based around curriculum and time provided in order to successfully complete it in due time. Ultimately, students will have to make decisions for themselves and organize their daily life giving them an advantage.\n \n Students grow rather lackidasical when dealing with a mundane routine back to back. During the school year, students spend eight to ten months being bombarded by the same tests and the same ESSAY prompts and the same book entries. Summer break, to them, is an escape from all of that pressure. Although it is neccessary to make sure that students retain the information they acquired that year, the students should be able to decide how the reestablishing of ideas and topics they learned. With guidelines and rules given by the teacher, the students can potentially produce work they are proud of and enjoyed working on.\n \n While it may seem rather bizarre to let students decide their own projects, the idea can be fruitful and beneficial for the students and teachers in the end. When the last bell rings for the year released them for summer break, the students bolt out of their school doors and practically forget all that they have learned. In order to prevent that, many teachers have implemented summer projects to assure the continued learning and retainment of their knowledge. However, during the summer when students are on vacation and living in paradise, the last matter they want to worry about is another project assigned by their teacher. Consequently, the students may potentially complete it without care to discard the thought of having work to do. This is ultimately counterintuative to the purpose of said projects. To fix this possible mishap, students should be able to design their projects with guidelines from their teacher so they enjoy the process of completing it while still enjoying their break, ehnace their organization and leadership skills and produce work to the best of their ability, With this method, the students can retain the information deemed neccessary by the teacher and the teacher is able to see this effort and productivity they put into it throughout the school year.",

      "Summer break for most students is a time when they can relax and enjoy a break from school and socialize with friends and family. While it may be in the students best interest to continue learning during the break while not in school, most times students are very reluctant to do their work if there is no in school motivation. If teachers insist on requiring students to complete a project over summer break they may receive better results if the project is student-designed. Having the students pick a teacher-approved topic that they are curious about would make them more interested in learning about their topic, give more effort to the project, and enjoy learning.\n \n When students are interested in what they are learning about they pay more attention, and that is very important in the learning process. Letting the student decide what they get to research would not only motivate them, but keep them interested. For example, over the years I myself have been assigned homework over summer break, usually reading, and my classmates and I were much more inclined to complete the homework when the teachers let us choose what books we wanted to read, rather than forcing us to read something we didnt want to. This translates to almost any age of student, if they are given choices, they feel less forced to spend their summer break completing a project, and are more likely to complete the project.\n \n As most students know, homework is not enjoyable most of the time and we procrastinate until the last possible minute to get our schoolwork done, and most of the time when we do this the product is sub par. This is not because of the lack of intelligence, it is because of the lack if interest and effort. When students do not care about the work they are creating they will put very little effort into what they are doing. While if it is something that they are passionate about they will put much more time and effort into what they are doing. Say there is a student who loves to learn about plants and animals and how they live and survive, giving them a project on the Civil War would not interest them, and therefore they would produce a project created with little effort, bare minimum. If this same student was allowed to research plants and animals over the summer, their project would most likelyÂ be something they are proud of not only because of the effort that was put in, but because they would feel accomplished that they learned something new.\n \n When students enjoy learning it makes them more curious about learning new things. When Students are told what to learn and are kept uninterested, they begin to associateÂ learning with boredom. This can be detrimental for the the growth children, if they no longer want to learn. More times then not, when a student feels defeated, or unintelligent they give up, and that discourages them from learning in the future as well. While it is a teachers job to guide and teach the essential information in the curriculum, it is also their job to foster creativity and instill the love for learning within their students. Teaches giving students freedom of choice would not decrease the teachersÂ authority, it would simply give variety, especially during the summer when students are not particularly wanting to learn. A summer project where the student gets to pick their own topic would be a good opportunity to instill within them that learning can be fun and enjoyable.\n \n A teacher-approved Student-designed project over the summer would be the superior choice over a teacher-designed project. This would not only produce better results but produce better retainingÂ of the information that they learned, to be used in the following school year. Overall giving the students control over what they learn during the summer, would still assure that they are learning over their break while also keeping them interested in learning, allowing them to give more effort to the project, and enjoy learning.Â",

      "In my own opinion, as a high school junior at Generic_School; to further your education during the summer, schools should allow student-lead projects to take place. The pros of allowing students to design their own tailored made educational projects out weigh the cons. When you are able to design your own educational project you put more heart into it, then if it was teacher-designed. That extra passion allows for students: to explore different interests, connect with colleges, explore research foundations, and to participate in community service.\n \n Nudged deep in every student thoughts, especially teenagers,Â is the fact that college is right around the corner. Allowing students to use creativity to there advantage, instead of being left in a box doing a research paper. Gives them a positive opportunity to explore different careers and the majors attached to them. Lets say for a thought exercise, that a high school junior named Generic_Name is going to college, but sadly doesn't know what he's interested in. A student led project, gives him the perfect opportunity to pursue different career fields, to find out what excites him. By the time he graduates from high school, Generic_Name already has a generalized idea of what he wants to major in.\n \n Asking questions is essential in helping to find the right college or university. Creating a student-project for the summer, allows students to connect with both research foundations and professors at different colleges; enabling students to network earlier not later. To better explain my thinking behind this, think for a minute that your Generic_Name, and your doing a project on DNA. By contacting college level professors and other professionals in that field, you not only helped yourself by getting an A on your report, but by networking; when your ready to apply to college and the professors already know you, your chances for getting in just doubled. As a bonus when Generic_Name is looking to get a job or internship; by already knowing professionals in the field, he's more than likely to get his desired position.\n \n With passion comes community service, it's a saying I like to say, time to time. It works like an equation: passion plus creative project, equals community service. The more excitement that you have for a project, especially if you thought of it yourself, puts students in an unique position to voluntary get downed into the trenches of learning. When your learning, you often make the community better than how you left it in the summer. For an example, I recently met a young college grad named Generic_Name; he told me that in high school, his history teacher told him that a team of archaeologists needed volunteers to map an old Civil War battlefield. Sadly though he couldn't, because his English teacher over the summer made him write a mandatory research ESSAY on Jane Austen.\n \n All in all, students should be in charge of there own educational projects during the summer. It's like the old saying, you attract more with honey then with vinegar. Connecting it to a real world application, allowing someone to think rather then to be given; encourages someone to use passion, educate themselves, and put there heart into it, rather then sigh. Plus it's the summer, who wants to read a boring book from the eighteen hundreds! Â Â",

It can apply to here as well, students can learn what they are doing and use their learning to see how things are able to do what they do.

Since a lot of schools do require a summer project for students so they will have some type of work to do over the summer, it is much better for the teacher to create the summer project. Teachers are trained to give work they know is somewhat suitable for the students. For that reason projects should be teachers designed because they know what type of work to give their students, they usually would not assign something outlandish, they also would not make it as easy as the students will make it be.\n \n Some may argue that students will challenge themselves and not make it easy. People may also say that some teachers assign are a little outlandish and could be very hard for them. some may also say that students have a lot of things to do over the summer like jobs and sports and maybe even both. But not every student has those responsibilities and the others who do should find a little bit of time for their projects. Next, a reason for why teachers should design projects are because teachers know what type of project to design for the students\n \n First reason why summer projects should be teacher-designed is because teachers know what type of project to assign. Reason for that is because teachers most likely having been assigning projects for years know what type of projects may be to hard or maybe to easy for some students. Most teachers by the time it teachers summer will have a good understanding of what some students can do and can not do, and they know if they should make it challenging or make it somewhat easy. Teachers will try their best to not make the projects too hard for the students to complete for example a teacher would not tell their students to read like say ten books and then summarize them, reason being is because they know not every student has the time to complete it if they have other things going on in their lives. Secondly, teachers wold not assign something that seemed very outlandish or bizarre.\n \n Secondly, teachers would not assign a project that was outlandish and bizarre. Like for example a teacher would not tell you to writeÂ 5 full ESSAYs in MLA style have it hand written and also typed. Reason for that is because even though summer may seem long it can actually go by very quickly and many students have things to do over that period of time. For example a student may have a sport that has practice everyday or may have a job that requires them to work everyday. With that in mind teachers would make it challenging but will try to not make the projects very outlandish. Another reason for why teachers would not assign a bizarre project could also be that not all teachers want to grade a lot of papers. For example if they were to assign something like a few ESSAYs and a reading project all the grading they would have to do is much greater than the work the students had to do, just because their are a lot of students who may have done the work. In addition to teachers making the projects outlandish and bizarre they would also not make the project as easy as the students might make them.\n \n Lastly summer projects should be teacher designed because teachers would not make the projects as easy as the students may make them. Students usually like to not do anything over summer because they think of it as their break from work and projects, so if the school allowed the students to make them the students might make it very easy so they do not have to do much. Students would take advantage of them being able to make their own projects for example, students may make a a easy project like read a comic book or something like that and not do that much. The teacher however will make it somewhat challenging like for example they will assign a project that would not be very easy but will make it somewhat hard. Not all students will make it easy their are some students who will challenge themselves to do good and make a good project. But it would be better and more efficient if the teacher were to design it. Lastly, in all it would be more efficient if the teacher were to design the summer project\n \n In conclusion teachers should design the summer reading project because they know what to assign to their students, they not gonna make it outlandish or bizarre, they are also not gonna make it as easy as the students might make it. Teachers get paid to each students so it would make sense if the teachers would assign the summer projects because they know what type of assignments to give for the students. After all of this is done i want you to,look back and realize why teacher should make the summer projects and why students should not be able to. Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â",

    ESSAY:
      "Do you really think student's would like to complete summer projects over the summer? Me personally i would hate to even think about having some type of extra work in the summer, why? well here are my three reasons. I know sometimes in the summer, were bored and can't wait to start school. Secondly there's times where we want summer to hurry up and come around, because were drained mentally, physically, and emotionally because of the thought, we have work to finish up, make sure you turn it in on time before the due date and focus on maintaining to keep your grades looking good and not disappointing,. Thirdly, no teacher nor student would like to do a summer project over the summer.\n \n Although, in the summer, were sometimes bored and can't wait to see are friends so were excited for school to start back up and hang out with are fellow peers. Because i know some people can't go out, hang out with friends because their parents are too stricked; or they're furious about letting their kids out at a certain time even though they can have a bed time but some parent's just can't risk anything i'm talking out of experience because my parent's are like that, it's not fun at all. But honestly you'll thank them later on as you get older or when you have kids because, how society now days is set up is crazy! , i tell you.\n \n Then, we started school, for example \"September 4, 2019\" is the first day we enrolled in school then give it a few months into the school year \"January 11, 2020\". let me tell you, the first day of school was memorable, seeing the pleasant faces of missed friends and teachers was probably the best, but as soon you get later into the year it's not so jolly anymore, your're DRAINED the feeling that you just want to drop out, give up, you dress like you don't love yourself because of the amount of stress on school work, the end of year state test's, so you can't help but to say \"I can't wait for summer\" out of your mouth. You feel so relived when the word \"summer\" comes out, you start thinking about all the things you can't wait to do.\n \n After, when you are finished with school, who wants to go home and wants to start on a summer project?? most defiantly not the teachers nor the students, we have been learning for months and i know teachers are sick, tired and cant wait to catch a break, don't get me wrong we need to gain knowledge everyday but after all the months we've been learning and teachers staying after to grade our papers and assign are next assignment when we come in class is a call, a call that we need a break.\n \n To sum it all up. The moral of the story is no, no i don't think teacher's nor student's should be required to complete a summer project over the summer, it's too much for them and i'mÂ pretty sure their brain needs some type of break, you know? vise verse. I hope the schools that require this assignment should think about there decisionÂ a little more. Respectfully. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

      "The Sun is blazing, the sky is blue, and school is out. What more do students want? Once summer starts school books are thrown to the back of the closet, never to be seen until the next year. This worries schools since when students aren't learning during the summer then classes have to be provided for students to relearn everything they forgot. This led schools to develop summer projects so that their students will learn during the summer. However, issues started to arise of how they should be designed. Some say teachers should design it and others say that students should design it. Although teacher-designed summer projects would help set guidelines so that the students can learn as much as they can, student-designed projects will let the students showcases their creativity.\n \n When designing the summer projects, teachers most definitely would set guidelines for students to help them, when they get stuck. However, what teachers don't realize is that by setting guidelines they are really restricting the student's creativity. They are limiting what the students can do and for the students to get a good grade on the projects, they would base their entire project on those guidelines. Which would mean they aren't really learning. These set guidelines would correspond with the topics that the teacher assigns. The assigned topics would focus on the materials the students need the most help in. Which in reality is forcing the students to learn. When someone is forced to do something they aren't interested in doing, they wouldn't usually put their full effort in to completing that task. This is the same for students too. By forcing the students to do these projects and not letting them chose what topic to do, the students wouldn't put all their effort in the project. This represents that the students aren't actually learning. This would be theÂ oppositeÂ effect of what the summer projects were intended to do.\n \n If the students were to, however,Â design the projects instead, then the issue of them not learning would be avoided. By making the students design their own projects, they are able to showcase their own creativity and develop new skills. Most students, during school, have a difficult time demonstrating what creativity they have. However, by giving them this chance to design their own projects the students can really put their full heart into it since they would actually have interest in the topic. By being able to design their own projects students can also develop new skills, like leadership. Leadership is when someone is able to take charge in a difficult situation. The students would be able to represent this when they have to take charge to develop their own project based off the topic they chose. Having the ability to showcase their own creativity and develop new skills, students would be able to fully grasp what their learning. Schools then wouldn't have to worry about assigning classes so the students can relearn everything they forgot, since when school starts in the fall students would be ready to tackle new topics.\n \n When it comes to demonstrating why students should design their own projects, schools should look towards the science fair. The science fair is a student-designed project that every student has to do, at least once, in their high school or middle school life. The science fair makes students pick a topic that their experiment would be based off of. When picking the topic, the student is showcasing their creative side since they aren't restricted on what topic to pick. During the experiment process, students are able to develop research skills for when they have to write their background paper on their hypothesis. Since they would need to find respectedÂ articles that relate to theirÂ hypothesis.Â Students would also be developing their leadership skills since when doing their experiment things can go wrong and they have to take charge and figure out why. At the end of the science fair process, students can then really grasp the understanding of the scientific design process and how to develop a well done experiment. This would all be possible since the science fair is a student designed project. If the teacher were to design the project and pick the topics, students would have never been able to fully understand the scientific design process.\n \n Schools should make the summer projects student-designed since it allows students to showcase their creative side. Even if having them teacher-designed would help set guidelines the students can look back at when stuck. By having teachers design the projects, students are going to be restricted and aren't going to be able to really learn since they won't be putting all their effort into the project. This would all be avoided if students were to design the projects themselves, because they won't be restricted and instead they would put all their effort into the project. At the end, students would be developing new skills and getting to actually learn. A perfect example is the science fair, where students are made to design their own experiments so that they can understand the scientific design process and how to properly make a experiment. Schools should trust their own students for their own learning at certain times.Â",

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. These projects range from all sorts of different styles and designs. Some people argue that these assignments should be teacher-designed so it is more detailed and challenging. Others argue that it should be student-designed so its better for the student. Summer projects should be student-designed because students will learn better from it, students will be more passionate about it, and teacher-designed projects take away freedom.\n \n Summer projects should be student-designed because students will learn better from it. People learn better when they do things themselves. If students have the ability to choose how to do their project, then they can learn from their mistakes. Mistakes are the best way to learn which makes student-designed projects the best way to learn. Furthermore, its helps students overcome obstacles. When students are doing their projects they will run into troubles. If the project is student-designed, they will have to overcome these obstacles themselves and help them grow academically. To sum it up, student-designed projects help students learn from mistakes and help them overcome obstacles.\n \n Summer projects should be student-designed because students will be more passionate about it. Students will do their project if they can choose what its on. If students can choose the subject of the project they will be more likely to do it because they are interested in what it is about. If the project is something they do not care about, they will not complete the assignment. Students will have more fun doing the project. If students can choose the subject of the project they will likely choose something they are interested in. If the subject of the project is something the student enjoys, they will have a great time doing it. To sum it up, student-designed projects will encourage students to complete the assignments and students will have a good time doing it.\n \n Summer projects should be student-designed because teacher-designed projects takes away a student's freedom. Teacher's get to choose everything. Teacher's get to choose what assignments students receive throughout the whole school year. Students should get the chance to be free and choose what they want. Furthermore, Students should get the choice of how the project gets done. Students have to take time out of their vacation to complete their summer project. Since they're using their own time, they should at least get to decide how to do their project. To sum it up, student-designed projects give students the freedom to learn what they want to learn.\n \n Student-designed projects are better than teacher-designed projects because they help students learn better by making them overcome obstacles. Students are also more passionate about it and it gives them the freedom to do what they want. Students don't get the chance to choose many things, but summer projects should be something they get to complete the way they want.",

      "Spring break is lots of fun for students that are in school. Students get one or more weeks of school off to do what they want to do. During spring break there still should be some learning going on in the students spring break. Whether that be ESSAYs, projects, or book reading, students should be doing work through break. Some schools require students to complete projects during spring break week. Students should design the project that kid wants to do so they can remember it better and learn from what that student is saying and doing in that specific subject.\n \n First, students would benefit more from making their own projects from scratch. So many kids can not always comprehend what the teacher is teaching them so the kids try an put the knowledge into his or her own words. Teachers should not be responsible for how the students do the projects. Kids and teens that are in school can retain more information when him or her are doing the project based on what they think is right. Also, the students should be able to choose what the project that student is going to do because, the students are more likely to agree, be able to compare with that project, feel more connected with it, and interested.\n \n Second, learning during break is a good thing for students to do for themselves without the teacher present. If the kids put his or her own effort into doing a project without the teachers outlines, the students will be way more successful in learning and retaining the information those students have just done in the project. In some cases, having a student make up his or her own projects is a gigantic help to the grade and to the teachers. Students would benefit more from making the project something that student loves to do or a special hobby that kid has.\n \n Some may say that, a teacher designed project is better for the students. Students would be able to go back and reference what is supposed to be on the project that the teacher has given that person. However, student designed projects are better for the class. The kids will be willing and able to do a project thatÂ him or her want and desire to do.\n \n In conclusion, kids should design the project so that him or her can remember what that student is learning in class. Some students have a hard time grasping what the teacher is teaching them. The kids tend to learn more and pay more attention at home or somewhere other then school. Projects over spring break should be student designed.Â Â  Â Â Â",

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break.\n \n Completing a summer project allows students to refocus more quickly when school starts again and ensures that skills students learned during the previous school year remain sharp.\n \n Additionally, the completion of a summer project provides for a phantasmagoria of success throughout the upcoming school year.\n \n However, most of these summer projects are teacher-designed rather than student-designed.\n \n Summer projects should be student-designed because students learn differently, can explore their passion, and can show off their unique skill set.\n \n Obviously, students have different learning abilities and may learn differently from their peers.\n \n For example, students who are classified as auditory learners would not succeed on a hands-on project to continue their education because they prefer verbal explanations or videos to learn.\n \n Additionally, some students are visual learners; they may require to see another person's work in order to complete their own.\n \n Therefore, assigning these students a hands-on project would not be beneficial to their education.\n \n When different learning styles are taken into consideration, it is evident that each individual student is aware of how they learn; consequently, they should be able to devise a project that fits their unique learning style.\n \n Furthermore, assigning a student a project that does not interest them would make completing the project seemingly unbearable.\n \n Students would choose topics that interest them if given the chance to design their own project.\n \n For example, a student who is particularly interested in automobiles would not wish to complete a project on the effects of cow manure on the pollution of waterways.\n \n They, in turn, would not take this project seriously, which would be detrimental to their grade.\n \n Additionally, giving students the opportunity to design their own project would allow the teacher to see each student's passions.\n \n This would benefit both teacher and student because the teacher would learn about the student's interests on the first day of school rather than through awkward \"getting to know you\" activities.\n \n Giving students the ability to design their own projects would allow each student to be excited to explore their interests and present their passions to the classroom when school starts again.\n \n Some would say that allowing the students to design their own projects would cause an issue for the teacher to grade it because each student's project would be different.\n \n However, allowing students to design their own project would give them the ability to show off their specific set of skills.\n \n For example, students who are gifted in vocal music would not succeed on a project that involves woodworking, and vice versa.\n \n Students should be given the opportunity to share their gifts with the teacher so that future projects could be set to their strengths rather than their weaknesses.\n \n On the issue of grading these projects, teachers could evaluate the amount of time and effort that appears to be put into each project rather than using a cookie-cutter rubric.\n \n Students would be more successful on a project that showcases their skills than if a teacher designed the project for them.\n \n Grading these projects would simply take a more evaluative angle from the teacher.\n \n When one considers that students have individual learning needs, wish to complete projects based on their passions, and are more successful completing projects that emphasize their skill set, then one can see that students should be able to design their own summer project rather than complete one that is teacher-designed.\n \n Allowing students to design their own summer project would, consequently, prepare and excite them for the upcoming school year where they would be able to present findings that are unique.\n \n This would then build momentum for the remainder of the school year.\n \n Although projects would prove to be dampening to the students' summer break, completing a project that explores their interests would be less gruesome than a teacher-designed project.Â",

      "Summer break is for students to have fun and enjoy the long warm days, however, school requires for students to continue learning. The way they want you to continue your learning is by making projects. Schools want to know if they should be teacher-designed or student-designed.\n \n In my opinion if students are going to be required to make these projects they should at least be able to be student-designed. Since it's summer, students are not going to be pleased having to make a project espescially if its teacher-designed. If students were allowed to make the project their own way they would be able to make anything that involves what is going on with their summer break. They would have also more options and ideas than if the projects were to be teacher designed. Student's would have a greater chance doing extremely better if they went based on their own creatation.\n \n Students would maybe struggle a little because then again they are only students, so they wouldn't know if they did it right or if they have enough work done. If it were to be teacher-designed, student would have an idea of how much they would need to include. It would take longer but a student would know what the teacher is looking for and what they would consider a good grade. As a student myself i overthink a lot on the work i do on my own; i ask myself \" does this look right or is it missing something?\". Which leads me to try and making it better.\n \n Overall, i would prefer if the school would allow the projects to be student-designed instead of teacher-designed. It would take less time if students had the choice to have our project made the way they think is best. Students work faster when given something to do on their own because it opens their mind up to more than one thing. Since the project is a requirement i feel as if it should be fun and made however students feel is right, this way they spend more timing doing it and getting the work done.\n \n In conclusion, students should be allowed to have the choice to make their summer project just the way they feel is right. Teacher-designed projects don't let a students be as creative as if they made it with their own ideas.",

      "Having a summer project to do may seem like a bad thing byt what if you got to choose the project you wanted to do or would you let the teacher choose, these summer projects should be givien by teachers.\n \n The teachers would know what projects and what to expects from certain kids. While knowing what kids she has she would not give the kids to mush work or to little work. Then from there on the teacher would give the right amount of work to the kids so they can still be ready for school but also have fun on their vacation. As of this choice is the students decide to do it or not it won't harm the teacher, but for the kids that do it they might have a extra credit put in or maybe even help them pass a class.\n \n More reasons for teachers to assign these projects would be, cause the have more time on their hands.\n \n Students get out before the teachers and teachers still have to work extra few days for planning for stuff. When they do this they can take some extra hours to make this project depening on the subjects they are doing and what they are doing it might take a while, but they can get it over as soon as possible. The teachers that already do summer programs could also help with making, creating, and grading the projects and the teachers would probably get it done in enough time for the student to finish\n \n While on the aother hand;, students may think that if they go tot plan it that it wouldbe alot better. Students wouldt attempt to probably cheat and get veryone the same project ao that they all can do it together.\n \n The kids would not take their own project that serious seeing that most kids barely take school seriously. Student would make short little projects about what they did for summer or something tghey wouldn't really pick something that would keep them educated out of school. They wouldn't really care about something they have a choice for they wouldn't taoke it serious. Teachers will get it done in enough times; on ther other hand the stiudents might not, also some students may have a different influence on other students but some may not so they might not like the projects that they get given to them by certain student. Students will listen to their own teachers but the only problem is will they do it.\n \n In conclusion, teachers should create these sumer projects instead of students cause they are actually going to make them educated and well-shared; while on the other hand students don't have the same influence as teachers.Â  Â Â Â",

      "Summer assignments are known to and disliked by every students that has had to complete these tedious tasks. Schools assign summer projects to assure that their students are still learning during their breaks. However, as you grow up the tasks that are assigned tend to shift from something that is teacher-designed to student-designed. Some people may say that teacher-designed assignments are more beneficial to a students learning, because teachers know the material that should be learned and these project are easier to understand.Â However, they are wrong because student-designed projects have a lot more benefits that are necessary to a students learning and growth. Summer projects should be student-designed because they ensure that the subject of the assignment is relevant and interesting to the student and they teach them important skills.\n \n To begin, student-designed projects let students pick subjects that are most likely to benefit them. Teachers dont know what field every student wants to study in, and so they cant make a project that will be beneficial to everyone. For example, the most common summer assignment is to read a book and then write an ESSAY on what the student has learned, which helps kids in their reading and writing skills. However if a student wanted be a scientist, although this project would be somewhat useful, it wouldnt help them get closer to achieving their goals and dreams. On the other hand if the project would have been student-designed the future scientist could have chosen to conduct experiments or learn more about what interests them. Also, student-designed projects motivate kids to continue learning and so they wont lose interest. When a student picks their own assignment, they will be more likely to finish it and more than that they will actually want to finish the project. An example of this in a different context from my daily life is myself doing some cleaning. If my parents told me to clean, i will most likely put it off or do a sloppy job, because i didn't want to do it in the first place and at that point i am being pressured and forced to do the chore, but if i chose to do it on my own terms everything would get done in an orderly fashion. I feel like students use a similar mindset for completing project. If it was student-designed, they would be motivated to keep working and in the end they would produce better work. Some people may say that teacher-designed projects are better because, they focus on material that students should know for every career option, but they are wrong because what is important to learn in one field might not be as important to learn if they chose to pursue a job in another field.\n \n Secondly, student-designed projects teach students very important life skills. It teaches them to be self-reliant. They have to come up with their own project and set out their own rules and criteria. They cant look back at the instructions and follow what the teacher said, and they cant ask specific question about how to do the project, because everyone has a different project specific to themselves. This type of project makes it necessary to think on their own and not get help or take short cuts from others. Learning how to problem solve and understand things on your own is something that will be crucial as an adult so it best to learn it at a young age. Also, self-projects help you stay organized. When you are doing something completely on your own, with your own ideas you cant lose or forget things because it is detrimental to your project. Unlike something that is assigned where you can just look back on the website or check the paper to find the answers, you have to keep track of everything yourself or else you wont have the answers. Lastly, student-designed projects help with time-management. During my personal project, since i had trips and activities planned during the summer, i had to set out a specific time lineÂ with goals that i wanted to have complete by each week. Before this project, I was very bad at completing tasks because i would always put it off until it was the very last minute. With this project, i was forced to do everything in a process or else i would fall behind. Students would not learn all these skills if everything was laid out by a teacher in a teacher-designed project.\n \n Although teacher-designed projects are easier to understand and the teacher know what material is important, student-designed projects are a lot more beneficial to every individual student. Having a student design their own summer project ensures that what they are choosing to learn is beneficial and interesting to them. It also teaches students life skills that are important for everyone to learn at a young age. The point of summer assignments are to keep the student learning even when they are out of school. I think if the main goal of the school was to have students just learn information during the summer, then a teach-designed project would be acceptable. However, if the schools wanted their students to not only learn but grow and develop as young adults, then havingÂ student-designed projects are the better options to go with.Â",

    ESSAY:
      "In today's world, the competition for higher education is ever increasing, with the requirements for test scores, GPA, and extracurricularsÂ growing exponentially each year. To help keep up with the competition and separate students from the general masses, some schools are beginning to require summer projects to ensure students are continuing to learn, even when out of school. While this practice is becoming more and more common, many schools are struggling to decide whether these projects should be assigned by the teacher or created by the students. Although some say that teachers should assign summer projects because they will be more suited to helping students learn, summer assignments should be student-designed because they will excite students to learn, be better suited for the students' lives, and encourage creativity.\n \n First, student-designed projects are superior because they inspire and excite students. In a learning environment, passion and excitement are paramount to student success. Often times when teachers assign projects and assignments, they have little regard for the interests of the students, causing the class to dread working on the assignment and putting it off until the last moment. Also, when students choose their own project, they can ensure they are relevant for their future plans. For example, if a student wanted to become a banker in the future, they could base their project around the world of economics instead of wasting their time on a project about the Civil War. All in all, student-designed projects would encourage success because students would be more invested in completing the projects and they would help them in their future careers.\n \n Additionally, student-designed projects benefit students because they are better suited for students' lives. In any given high school, there are students who live drastically different lives, from students who have to work two jobs to teens who have nothing but free time after school. Because of this vast diversity, not all students reap the same benefits from a teacher-designed project. If students were able to design their projects, they would create projects that work best with their schedule and do not cause any undue stress. In addition, some projects are not economically feasible for all students. As an example, if there was a teacher-designed project that required all students to build a robot out of costly circuit boards and 3-D printed materials, not all students would be able to afford the materials, causing them to take short cuts and hurt their grade. Student-designed projects would ensure that students can design an assignment that fits their budget and would help to close the disparity in success between wealthy and working class students. To conclude, student-designed projects benefit students because they ensure that the assignments fit in with students' busy schedules and tight budgets.\n \n Finally, student-designed projects help ensure out-of-school learning by helping to spur student creativity. When students are assigned a project by a teacher there is little abstract thought needed to complete the project, all they have to do is follow the teacher's directives and they will get an acceptable grade. When students create their own projects, however, they are forced to think deeply throughout the entire process, from formulating the topic to deciding upon the presentation methods. Also, student-created projects encourage creativity because it opens the door for the study of more abstract topics instead of the mundane, ordinary topics that teachers usually dwell on. For example, music is shown to increase creative thinking, so if a student wanted to learn about the French Revolution, they could create a topic like, \"The French Revolution and its effects on the Romantic music of the day,\" instead of an ordinary topic like, \"The effects of the French Revolution.\" In summary, student-created projects encourage learning by requiring students to use their creativity.\n \n In conclusion, student-designed summer assignments help students learn because they interest students, fit students' lives, and inspire creativity among teens. If schools began to implement student-designed summer projects, they would begin to see an increase in passion and preparedness come August when students go back to school. As a result of the increased drive shown by students, schools will also begin to see more and more students attending accredited, well-respected universities upon graduation. Schools must start allowing students to design their students to design summer projects, for it will create an educated, passionate, and happy school community.",

    ESSAY:
      "Many students and teachers argue over the question of whether or not students should be able to design their own summer break projects. There are mixed answers over the quality of the work, the amount of creativity that should be allowed in the school building, and how well this ensures students learn the material. Teacher led projects, however, take away all of the potential positive effects associated with those concerns. Summer projects should be student designed to increase creativity in students, make sure students know their classroom material well, and increase the quality and student interest of these projects.\n \n Summer projects should be student designed to boost creativity in students. When a teacher designs a project, it takes away the opportunity for the student to design and create their own representation of the assignment. When students get to choose their methodology of presentation, there are often more creative outcomes. For example, in an AP Government class at Generic_School, the students were given the opportunity to create a project on one of the departments of Congress. This led to numerous different types of projects: songs, raps, creative videos, etc. Had the teacher mandated they all do a PowerPoint (or other mode of presentation), the students would not have had nearly as much fun or been as informative in their projects. School should be about learning, but there should also be an element of creativity and expressing oneself in the classroom. Letting students design their own projects leads to much more creativity and student interest in the classroom.\n \n An additional reason that summer projects should be student designed are to ensure student comprehension of the topic. When a student has to generate their own mode of presentation, this ensures that they fully understand the classroom material, because the expectation in student designed projects is that students have to not only understand the material, but know it well enough that they can pick an appropriate way to present it to their peers. In the AP Government class, when the students were able to present their own projects to the class, many students agreed that they learned the material better than they would have if they had just done a generic presentation. It is common knowledge that when someone knows something really well, that they can teach it, and this kind of presentation enables the student to show exactly how much they know. Student designed projects make sure that students know their class information very well, and can teach it to their peers as a result.\n \n Some might argue that having a teacher designed project is better because when students are given the freedom to do their own project, the quality will not be as high. This, however, is not the case; although there are always counterexamples, the vast majority of students put more work into their presentation when given the opportunity to choose what it looks like. Referring back to the AP Government class, classroom presentations where students had the liberty to present how they chose were always of higher quality than projects where the teacher chose the mode of presenting. This is due to lack of interest in students; if a student is not interested in their project, they will not put as much effort while when students are given a creative outlet, they tend to put more of themselves into their work. Teacher designed projects are not the better of the two options due to their lack of freedom and decreased quality of work as a result.\n \n Summer projects should be student designed to boost creativity, ensure student comprehension, and increase the quality of their projects. When students are given the freedom to express themselves, it improves the learning environment and encourages more students to come to school. Teachers should be able to give their students more freedom in assignments such as summer projects.Â",

      "If I was to receive work for the summer break I would rather it be student designed work and not teacher designed work for many reasons. Theres the fact that if my work was designed by a student someone with a similar mindset as my own I would be able to understand it more clearly than if it was designed by a teacher. Plus theres the fact that student designed work has a possibility of being more simplistic, although teacher designed work is good for challenging the mind and stimulating brain cells im sure students would much rather enjoy there break much sooner. For example if your teacher gave you the choice to have the person to your left choose your summer project for you or have a five page ESSAY on a prompt she gave you which one would you rather do not that hard of a choice is it.\n \n One of the main reasons why I prefer work made by students over work made by teachers is because its easier to comprehend for those who have a harder time understanding more than others. With students making the work It would challenging without being to difficult to the point were it would consume a large amount of time to complete and not anytime to do anything during summer break. Unlike if you got an Teacher assigned project which could have the possibility to consume a large amount of time to complete. Like for example: if hypotheticaly speaking if the person to your left only give an assignment to write one to two paragraphs about a entire country and there culture or get an a your teacher gives you to write a four to five page ESSAY about the history of schoool and how it started.\n \n If I were to have a choice between simple work and complex work I would choose simple almost everytime because of one main reason is it takes less time to do. With the student designed work you would finish faster allowing you to have more free time to enjoy your summer break and relax away from school. Theres also the added benefit of getting more simple work done in a short time frame than you would complex work. I conclude this by saying that it would be more logical to have students design there own work for the summer break rather than have a teacher assign them some work for the summer break.",

      "Good morning Educators of Generic_City. Have you ever wanted your student, who seems to be disengaged or just not interested in class, to actually feel like they have a choice to make their learning experience more exciting? Then, maybe, you can consider this solution. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. As a student, I believe that students don't need summer projects ; it causes a high level a stress. However, if I had a choice then I would consider making summer projects student-designed. Teachers, this could quite literally be the answer to your prayers! Giving your student a chance to design their own summer project would give them a sense of independence that they need. Not only that, but I can guarantee that your student will have the desire to learn by the time summer break is over.\n \n It's not a surprise when students go to their teachers ; not knowing how to complete their assignments. Although, there is absolutely nothing wrong with students asking for help, but I know teachers get tired of repeating themselves. That is why giving students a student-designed project would increase their independence. Back in middle school ; when I went to Generic_School. My English teacher assigned a winter break project. The only requirement was to be creative. My English teacher had come to the conclusion that giving out a rubric would stress out the entire class. Since then, I've been more open to design my own projects. No more : \"How do you do this?\" or, \"Could you repeat that please?\" I am fully aware of what is needed to be done on my own. That independence is just the thing students need to succeed. Some may argue and say that giving students independence would only stunt their work performance. They could even say that students need that sense of reform. However, trying to reform your students would only be in vain. How are students going to fully understand if teachers don't give them the space to be independent? In fact, their work performance would gradually increase. Students take extra time to complete their assignments whenever they get up to ask their teacher a question. Now would you rather have your student waste their work time? Or, would you rather have your student independently do their work?\n \n It may be difficult to believe, but most students do enjoy coming to school to learn new material. If teachers want all of their students to be excited to learn something new ; they should consider how student-designed projects couldÂ possibly help. Its been proven, that half of the student population feel more engaged in a lesson when the have the artistic freedom. Students could write a song about Math, or maybe come up with their own screenplay about the evolution of rocks. Giving your students the power to designing their projects would, soon enough, catch their attention. Teachers could argue and say that it would only be a waste of time. It might be a waste of time, however, your students will feel more engaged with the subject. If you don't want your students to be interested in the lesson, then you might just lose everything you want your student to accomplish.\n \n Creativity is key in todayÂ day in age. Change is inevitable ; you can't hide from it. People desire to learn new things, but want to be creative when doing so. Teachers must be willing to change the way they want to teach their students. Students need a chance to prove that they are capable to be independent. Independence is one of the main things we, as people, try to achieve in the future.",

Finally Students might forget about and not do it at all.\n \n Teachers who design their projects for students knows how they want the students to do their assignment.\n \n Teachers that design their projects can be easier for students because they will know what to do and how to do it.\n \n Teachers that design the project can me more professional becasue students may make a mistake and not know what they missed and can look to see and fix it.\n \n Students who are busy during the summertime might be harder for them to come up with a projects on their own.

      "Many students would like to be the ones deciding what project they will do over the summer instead of having it assigned by a teacher. However they may not make wise decisions and they are very likely to choose the easy way out. Therefore, Students should not be allowed to design their summer projects because students will choose something that's too easy, students will procrastinate if they know it is their choice, and students will choose something they're already familiar with and will not learn anything new. Teachers need to assign these summer projects to ensure that students are having a positive and helpful learning experience over summer break.\n \n One reason students should not design their own summer projects is because they'll choose something that's far too easy for them. For example, If Generic_Name tells Generic_Name that he gets to decide what his summer project is, Generic_Name will be very happy because Generic_Name is a good teacher and probably would've given an assignment that he would consider \"too hard.\" Instead, Generic_Name will now go home and take 20 minutes to write about Spongebobs marine life and get an easy A. This will not benefit Generic_Name in any way, shape, or form because Generic_Name took 20 minutes out of 9 weeks to write about non-sense he knows will be an easy A. Therefore, teachers should assign projects in order to assure that students are actually putting their brains to work over the summer.\n \n Another reason students should not design their own summer projects is because many of them will go home thinking they have plenty of time to complete a simple project. This will lead to procrastination and many students will end up forgetting they had a project to do. For the students who procrastinate this will teach them bad habits and for the ones who forget and didn't do it, it will not benefit them at all. By letting students design their own projects in a 9 weeks time span, teachers are opening the doors to bad habits their students may learn. Therefore, teachers should assign these summer projects in order to keep students away from learning bad habits.\n \n In addition, students should not design their own summer projects because teachers know exactly what the students need to learn. The teacher should choose something important, that's not too easy, and that will help the students out in the long run. For example, If Generic_Name assigns Generic_Name to 3 ESSAYs about Oceanography , Generic_Name may not be happy, but it will help him a lot years down the road. When Generic_Name gets to 11th grade he will be an ESSAY master, he will get an A in English class, he will score a 600 on his writing SOL, and he will even be an excellent Oceanographer! Generic_Name will look back and be so grateful that Generic_Name gave him that assignment that he hated so much. Generic_Name will now realize that importance of having good projects assigned by qualified people. Teachers should assign summer projects to their classes in order to help them learn useful information that will help them throughout their lives.\n \n In conclusion, it is best to let teachers do their jobs and be the ones to decide on the summer projects. It is always interesting to see what different students choose for their projects, but the most beneficial to students would be the teacher-designed projects. For students it may not be fun but it is what's best for them and it will surely help them a lot more than the easy projects that they would have much rather chosen. Teacher-designed projects is the way to go!Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â",

      "Summer Projects\n \n By: Generic_Name\n \n Students are in school for 7 hours a day, 45 hours a week, 180 hours a month, and 180 days a year which is a very long time. Many schools in the United States require students to complete a project/assignment to assure that they keep learning over the summer. Students usually feel overwhelmed and stressed about these summer projects because of having to do assignments during their break. I believe that summer projects should be student designed because it allows students to freely choose a topic and not be stressed or worried throughout the whole summer.\n \n When students get assigned summer projects they usually ignore or not do them because the topic might be too boring, hard to do, takes a long time, etc. That's mainly because our teachers don't let them be student designed projects. Student designed projects are when the student gets to choose their own topic, do the work they want to do, and do everything based on what they want. Students hope that it could be student designed projects so it could take some weight off their shoulders and making it a topic they are comfortable with.\n \n Counter Claim: Summer projects should be teacher designed because not all students have great decision making abillities and don't have the skillset to do a project without the teachers help. If it were student designed then they would most definitly go off topic or show poor work and effort on the project. Teacher designed projects are when the teacher is in control. For example, they choose the topic, they choose what research you need to do, they choose if its an ESSAY or a presentation, etc. Teacher designed projects help students get ready for the upcoming school year and what they are gonna be learning in class.\n \n Student designed projects can help the students by learning how to do things on their own, help them gain amazing decision making skills, and gain experiences to help them later on in life. When the teacher's in control for everything then the student may lack in motivation or the will to even do the project. These projects can't help a student grow and learn if they are restricted to certain things that they can and can't do. Students should have the ability to do summer projects on their own with no stress and/or no restrictions.\n \n In sum, students get assigned projects or assignments to take home over the summer so that they could keep learning even during the break. Schools usually make these projects designed by the teacher(s). I believe that these projects should be student designed because summer is meant to be our break, we shouldn't have to have stress or anxiety because of these projects during our summer. Student designed projects can help us gain experiences as a student that we would never learn if they were teacher designed. They also help students feel that they are in control and it could help a student thrive to higher expectations.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

      "When someone says the word summer, people don't generally think about classrooms, or tardy bells, or chalkboards. Rather, about freedom from all of those things. Summer is a much needed break from the stressful conditions of school, however, whenever summer is ending and it's time to start heading back to school, students sometimes find themselves forgetting most of what they learned the year before. Some schools are requiring students to complete projects over the summer to ensure that they keep learning outside of the classroom, and to keep what they have learned the year before, fresh in their minds. These projects should be student-designed because summer should not be a continuation of school, students are more likely to do a project if they get to choose what it is, and it gives students the opportunity to excel and be given more trust.\n \n Summer is the time of year where students generally feel stress-free. There's no due dates, and no pressing homework. If these mandatory projects were teacher-designed, summer would feel more like school, and then students would have a bad connotation with the word summer. Sometimes people brush under the rug how stressful school can actually be to students, and summer is a much needed break. Though students do need to continue learning, it would be hard for a teacher to assign a project that fit everyone's specific needs and was appropriate for all students outside of the classroom. Summer break was installed for a reason, because if students go to school for 12 months, they'll more than likely get burnt out and will lose the motivation to learn. If students are allowed to design their own projects, they won't see it as school, but as fun.\n \n Students-no matter what age; kids, pre-teens, teenagers- haven't fully developed yet. They don't know who they are, or what they want, or what they believe in, because all they've known is their parents and the little bubble they live in for the first 18 years of their life. They try to find themselves everyday, they try to discover what their identity is. If students were able to design their own over the summer projects, they would be more likely to do it. There comes a point during childhood when people start to question authority, and start to become rebellious because they think they know what's best for themselves. At some point, kids have to be given that freedom in order for them to fail, gain humility, and then try again. If teachers were the ones designing the projects, students would be less likely to do it, and their grades would suffer.\n \n Teachers will generally tell you that trust is everything. If you don't have trust then you have nothing. Getting to pick your own project as a student, I would be elated. It shows that your teacher trusts that you will make the right decision and that you will get it done. The projects should differ from child to child because if one child wants to excel, then the limitations on the project to make another student comfortable, should not restrict him. Student-designed projects gives the students opportunity to excel in learning and to gain more trust from their teachers. Students usually have breakthroughs at least once during the years they are in school, when they start to realize that what they're learning is important and they start to care about what it is that they're learning, and learning becomes less like a burden and more like a privilege. Designing their own projects could spurr on this breakthrough and help students to realize that school isn't as bad as once anticipated.\n \n Summer should be a break from all the things that cause stress in the everyday lives of students. It should be a time to unwide and relax. Schools are beginning to issue over-the summer projects to make sure that the students keep learning, and remember what they have previously learned. These projects should be student-designed because summer should not be a continuation of school, students are more likely to do a project if they get to choose what it is, and it gives students the opportunity to excel and be given more trust. This will ensure that students stay happy over the summer, while teachers are equally as happy knowing that all of their hard work to educate the students has not gone to waste.Â  Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â",

      "Should these summer projects that students work on during their break be teacher-designed or student-designed? Students should be able to put their own ideas in this summer project and designed it the way they want it to be. These projects should help them make their brains become more active since they will be doing these projects over break. By doing this they won't have to \"refresh\" their brain on what they learned the past school year and will already know what to do when they come back to school after break because of this project.\n \n All students should put their ideas into their own projects and don't have to worry about what the teacher may give them. This can make the students become more active in the world or even school, and actually let them do something over break. They should let the students decide what type of project they want to work on that is helpful for them to continue to learn during break. If the students decide what they want to work on, then they should decide if it's going to take them the whole break or a couple of weeks to finish it. For example, they could do something they love to do over break instead of a teacher throwing any type of project to give them. Some students may be busy during break so this gives them the opportunity to work at their own pace. Since they know what they are doing for their project it shouldn't be that hard for them to manage.\n \n If the students designed the projects then it would let them be more engage on what they are learning and what's going on during their break. The school will have less students who are confused on what's going on and the teacher wouldn't have to keep explaining themselves more than once. Also, it can actually make the students want to do the project, because they are doing something they like instead of the teacher designing something boring. Sometimes the students forget about the project that the teachers designed to them because they don't want to do it or they just didn't understand the idea the teacher was giving them. Therefore, if the students designed it themselves then the school and teachers won't have to worry about who did or didn't do the project.\n \n Some people may think that teachers should be able to designed these projects. They may even think that the kids are not mature enough to do it and it's a teachers job to design them things. I understand it is a teachers job to teach the students, but it wouldn't be fun if all the teacher do is use his or her's own ideas. Shouldn't the students have a right to do things they like with the teachers helping them on the side. If they work together with the students and be more active with them, then that's when the students behave more mature and actually want to do the work. No students likes a teacher who only just talks and only do things their way without the students input.\n \n Students should be able to pick out what type of project they want to do and work it out step by step to complete it. If students do this on their own, then they could learn how to plan and manage things by themselves. They would be learning how to be more independent. This way it can help them later on in the future if they ever go to college and even for their future jobs. This could help the students be creative and have different types of creativity and ideas all around the school. Then, the school will have an idea on what interests their students and know more about them individually as a person.Â",

Summer projects should be teacher-designed due to it be able to benefit them the upcoming school year.\n \n To start with, teachers can give students guidelines for the project. The more instructions the students are able to have then the more understandable the project can be. Getting guidelines can give the students more ideas and can be less frustrating doing the project can be. For example,Generic_Name,a student at Generic_School,is spending time starting her project,she is confused on what to do from the beginning until she opened the guidelines that she was giving, having the guidelines made it much more easier to finish due to having a list on what was needed for the project.\n \n Secondly,having to do projects under teacher circumstances can be beneficial for related times in the future. Many more projects could come and be far more complicated,but using their current knowledge from past experience can make the project less frustrating. For example,Generic_Name has to start an project,now that the students are back in school from break,in the past he would struggle with projects,but by using his past knowledge that he learned,he had finished and reached all the expectations needed. In conclusion,using knowledge that you learned from the same situation in the past on your current ones can very much help in the future.\n \n Some people may disagree due to others seeing it in different ways. Others may see the project as not interesting because the students should be able to do it the way they want to due to them having to do the object during the summer and it not being able to benefit them because the students can not look back on their mistakes. Although, the project not being interesting should not be the case because they are learning not playing around. In addition, the students should know that having ideas on an project can help more so confusing them.\n \n In conclusion,these are my reasons why summer projects should be teacher-designed. The project being teacher-designed,allows more ideas that the students are able to use and makes the project easier.

Giving students the opportunity to create a project based on their own ideas and their own planning, will allow for success later in life.\n \n Another reason why students should be able to design their own summer projects is because it will show the teacher how much of a connection they have to the topic.

      "Hello, reader! My name is Generic_Name. Some schools require student to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. many question if they should be teacher-designed or student-designed? I believe that students should be the ones planning their own summer projects because it will be their summer vacation that they'll have in order to work on it. If the teachers are the ones designing the projects for their students, then teachers will most likely get the same thing from every student. Not only that, we as students may not enjoy doing it as much, because when it comes to doing big projects like these, we desire to put in our own creativity. For these next two paragraphs, I will be talking about these two reasons in greater detail before ending this prompt with my conclusion. They will be backed up mostly by my personal experience, but I will put in my own opinions and reasons. I will also be putting in lots of unique words that will this prompt more interesting. Now, let's begin.\n \n I don't believe teachers should be the ones planning out the project not for the fact that what they would assign will be boring or bad, but because each student might end up doing the same thing for each individual prompt, even if each student does put theyre own unique sense of creativity into them. For example, last year when I was doing Driver's Ed, we entered the part of Health & First Aid. And when all was said and done, we were given a project to do. It had to be be done on a tri-fold and the information had to be a printed out PowerPoint. I'll be honest, I really wasn't a happy chum doing the project at first, although I did enjoy doing the PowerPoint part of the project mostly because I have a love for PowerPoints. When the day came for the projects to turned in and graded, we all showed our own tri-folds to the class. Here, I noticed that we all did similar things in each of our tri-folds. True, we were each given a different topic to work on and many us got a little creative, but in the end we were pretty much the same.\n \n I understand that they do that to make certain we don't procrastinate or do minimum, but in order the project to have some form of uniqueness & full creativity, the student should have complete charge over the what & how of the project. an example of this happened last year in my Spanish II class, where we did a project that was about choosing three Latino recipes and write them out in Spanish. Our teacher, Sr. Generic_Name allowed us to make our project however we wanted, from being a cookbook, miniature tri-fold, PowerPoint, etc. But he also wanted to see our full potential, not just in art but in language as well, so using an online translator was generally unacceptable. And although he was fine with three simple but complete sheets of paper, there wouldn't be any bonus points for that. Fortunately, I paid attention in his class and my mother a Puerto Rican cookbook which she lend to me to use. Also, I don't mean to brag but I'm a great artist who it self-taught.\n \n Overall, I believe that students should their own thing in the project while at the same time, the teachers should receive something of great quality. The two examples I just talked about are my personal experiences & reasons why I believe in the power of the student, although I greatly understand the teacher's viewpoint giving us the basic backbone. So, in a way, neither side is perfect or wrong. But of course, thats just my opinion.",

      "Have you ever had to do summer projects during summer break? Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Summer projects should be students-designed because students could be more creative, students can go at their own pace, and students would be more inclined to complete their projects.\n \n Some people say summer projects should be teacher-designed because it would help them practice for topics that would be discussed the next school year. However, summer projects should be student-designedÂ because students could be more creative with what they do. For example, when a teacher assigns you a project the set their projects to be something specificÂ like: show a graph, create a drawing of this, and/or write a ESSAY about this. When there are limited options like this, students that struggle at something like drawing could be put at a disadvantage and not grade as high as other students. Thats why if summer projects are student-designed students would be able to show off the talents they have and be more creative with what they present as their summer project.\n \n Secondly, summer projects should be student-designed because student can go at their own pace. For example, some projects could require students to do something that they dont understand and therefore they wouldn't be able to complete their project. However, if summer projects would be student-designed the students would be able to complete the project because they could do something that they know how to do and its at their own learning pace and they could also help teacher know what a student struggles at and what they know really well.\n \n Finally, summer projects should be student-designed because students would be more inclined to do complete their project. For example, one of the reasons many student don't complete their projects is because they think that the projects are too boring or are too hard. However, if the students get to choose what they are going to turn in as their summer project then they would do projects that they think are fun or aren't too hard and many more students would turn in their projects.\n \n In conclusion, summer projects should be students-designed because students could be more creative, students can go at their own pace, and students would be more inclined to complete their projects. For these reasons, I implore teachers to allow summer projects to be student-designed.",

      "On that faithful June afternoon, the school bell rings for its last time in three months. Students rush out of their classes and greet the summer with open arms. Of course, once school opens up again in August, many of these students have forgotten what they learned the previous year. Many schools assign projects to complete over the summer in order to keep their students' minds sharp; however, there are debates as to whether the teachers or the students should design the projects. Summer projects should be teacher-designed so students can properly develop the tools that will help them succeed the following year.\n \n Teacher-designed projects will set the rigor of the class so students know what to expect. It is most likely that the teacher that assigns the project will be the one instructing the class. If teachers design the project, they can set the guidelines for the year in their summer assignment so students are not caught off guard. This is especially important for higher level classes such as honors or AP; it is best that all students are aware of the class' expectations so they can develop their skills as necessary for the course. Students can also decide whether or not the class is right for them, whether it be because it is too rigorous, not rigorous enough, or simply because the subject matter does not interest them. This way there is less fuss during the school year as students try to switch their classes.\n \n Teacher-designed projects can allow the students to grow their academic independence. During the school year, teachers are readily available in case students need to answer questions. However, during the summer it is not as easy as raising one's hand in class; students are almost entirely on their own. They will have to develop the skills needed to solve a novel problem independently. This ability is referred to by psychologists as fluid intelligence. One's fluid intelligence decreases with age, so it is important for students to strengthen it while they are young. Students may also find useful academic tools that help them to understand the material of the class. One of the more well known of these tools is Khan Academy. Students often go to these websites to understand what they could not in class. Finding these tools during the summer will prove useful, as they can still be used during the school year.\n \n While student input is important, the teachers are more likely to give projects that are closer in rigor and content to the actual class. Teachers have been trained both in teaching that the subject that they teach, so they likely know the best way to prepare students for what lies ahead. This is why summer projects should be designed by teachers rather than students.",

      'Having to do school work over the summer? Summer assignments is a great way for students to not forget everything they learned over the school year. If a student goes from June to September without reviewing their course material from the previous years, they are bound to forgetting lots of important information. Students have very creative minds and should be able to come up with their own way of studying or going over past information. Teacher designed assignments can force students to do unnecessary research which can waste a lotÂ of time. Summer projects should be student designed because it allows each student to put their time in to something that interests them, teachers can learn more about their future students, and teacher designed projects sometimesÂ dis encourageÂ students to complete them.\n \n There is nothing better in school or in life when you are interested in a subject. It is much easier to pay attention and a lot more information that sticks with you. Doing a lot of research into a topic your not interested in is more or less a waste of time. A project led by a student could influence others to a career choice. Having to do work is never fun especially in summer but if students get to be creative they can find a topic which makes it more enjoyable. Teacher designed projects limits students into following certain formats and structures which limits the thought process being taken into place thinking about the project. Once again interesting topics lead to better productivity and work which is why students need to design their own projects.\n \n Forming relationships as a teacher is something that can change a students life forever. There are many kids in today society who feel like they don\'t belong or fit in. Knowing and appreciating someone the smallest can impact them more than someone can imagine. A student who creates their own project or structure will definitely tell you something about them. Engaging students with each others work is important to show the passion one may have for what they made. Student designed projects open up the opportunity to really show how much a subject matters and what can be done to change a way in society that is failing. Teachers knowing more about their students is important for students to want to come to class and for teachers to know when someone is not appearing to be feeling their normal selves.\n \n Teacher designed projects are usually straightÂ forward. When a student designs a project they complete much more work. Now I would say that if the students are below 5th grade having teacher designed projects is the better option due to most students at that level not being educated enough to think outside of the box. Regardless learning will take place on both sides and that students will dive deep enough into a subject to break the ice. Relationships will form from students bonding over ideas and sharing them with each other.\n \n When the question "should a teacher or student design a summer project?" comes up, I am aware that both sides has an argument but that students designing it is way more impactful to themselves and others. Career choices can easily be introduced while just selecting a topic. Forcing students to be oppurtunitive and aware student designed projects open it all up and enable them to select something that is interesting and important. Teacher designed projects are good when there is not a lot of time but having the whole summer gives each student many hours to work on an design their own masterpiece.',

      "Have you ever got a summer project?Â Summer projects are boring to do when all you want to do is have fun. Although, teachers can make the projects subject based and more specific.Â Students should design the summer projects because some students don't have access to internet, the projects will be unique, and the projects will have more effort and participation.\n \n Firstly, some students don't have access to the internet. Most projects involve research. If the students can't do the research how are they going to do the project? Some teachers expect the project to be done but what if it can't be. Teachers need to realize not everyone has internet at home. For example, a student was given a project on King Henry's life. He doesn't have internet at home and the library is too far to walk. The student never did his project and got a really bad grade.\n \n Secondly, the projects will be unique. The ideas that students can come up with are amazing. Kids have an unlimited amount of imagination and creativity, so letting them express that through a graded project can be really fun. For example, if the students were doing a science project. They have so many possibilities on what they can do. They could put Mentos in a diet Coke and write down what happens. If it was a photography project, the students can express themselves through the pictures and edit them however you want. There's so many more ideas tat students can come up with if you let them.\n \n Thirdly, The projects will have more effort and participation. If the students have their own say, or choice, in what they get to do the project on, there would be more projects turned in. Plus, the effort put into the projects would be greater. For example, one class gets to choose their project and another class do not get to choose. The class that got to pick their project has more projects, and more effort put into the projects, then the class that didn't get to choose. Another example is the teachers choose what students do one year for summer projects. Many students do not put in a lot of effort, just enough to get a good grade, and some don'tÂ even bother turning it in. The next year, the teachers let the students pick what to do for their projects. Most of the students turn in the projects and a lot of effort was put into them.\n \n In conclusion, students should design the projects instead of the teachers. Some students do not have internet. The projects will be unique. Also, the effort put it and the participation of the projects will be greater. If you have a summer project, convince your teacher to let the class design it. You'll see so many cool projects you might have not thought of.",

When teacher give projects, the student is limited to what they can do.\n \n When student are given projects and is able to do their own topic, they don't stay on the topic they choose.\n \n I think summer projects should be teacher-designed. This would be better because the students have a topic, its easy, and is fast to do.\n \n First, the students has topic. When a student has a one topic, they cant go talk about another topic. The student doesn't have to struggle between three or more subjects because they have one given to them. The teacher gives a specific topic because it's supposed to challenging. They want the students to use their brains.\n \n Second, the topic is easy. Some school teachers give their students easy topics because they wants students to enjoy their summer break. The subject should be easy for two reason for example: they had the topic before or its very simple.\n \n Third, the subject is fast to do. The topic should be fast to do because the teacher was able to do it. Their previous students was able to do it with no problem.

      "In a 2019 survey about homework during the summer, it was found that the majority of students said that they were extremely stressed aboutÂ summer assignments that teacher's had required them to do. Many of the students expressed that they had busy schedules and could not find the time to complete the assignments. Other's said that the projects were too difficult and confusing because they were designed poorly.Â While some will say that these summer assignments should continue to be designed by teachers because they are more educational, to be beneficial, the assignments should be student-designed to prevent boredom, frustration, and time consumption.\n \n Firstly, summer assignments should be student-designed to prevent boredom. For instance, the majority of the assignments are question or ESSAY based. This means that instead of enjoying a learning activity that applies to them, students will have to answer dull repetitive questions and write uninteresting ESSAYs about topics that they have no passion for. In result, students will put minimum effort into the assignments and finish them without learning anything. Also, if the summer assignments were designed by the students, they would pick a topic that they have interest in or believe would be enjoyable to complete. For example, if a project was assigned that allowed students to present an issue that they found interesting, the student would more than likely be excited and motivated to write about their topic. Overall, projects assigned during the summer should be designed by the students in order to prevent boredom.\n \n Secondly, students should design their summer assignments to prevent frustration. This is because during the summer, teachers will assign packets or papers that are confusing and difficult to complete, thinking that it will be beneficial or educational. However, this is not the case. Many students will find themselves stuck or frustrated trying to complete something that they have no idea how to do. This results in uncompleted or incorrect work that then starts the student's school year off poorly. Furthermore, if the assignments were designed by the students, they would have the ability to preview and understand what the project is asking. In other words, they would have the correct knowledge going into the assignment and will ultimatelyÂ learn more about the material for the following school year. In the end, a project designed by a student will prevent frustration.\n \n Lastly, summer projects designed by the students will take up less time. This is because many students are extremely busy during the summer. Between sports, vacations, and possible online classes, students find it difficult to manage summer homework. Teachers are not aware of every student's schedule and can assign projects that are almost impossible to complete. However, if the projects were designed by the students, this would not occur. Instead, students would design a project that they could easily time manage and complete in their own time. Also, because teacher-designed projects are long and complicated, this can cause a student to miss out on fun activities. This is becauseÂ of the created stress and limited time that the students often experience from the projects assigned. For example, during the summer, many students are traveling and are rarely in town at the same time. However, when they are, a student with an unfinishedÂ project, could miss out on an opportunity to see their friend because they are too busy with homework. All in all, summer projects should be student-designed because this would prevent time consumption.\n \n Overall, students should design the summer projects. This is because it will prevent boredom, frustration, and time consumption. If students experience these effects, the projects assigned will not only ultimately be ineffective but it will cause unnecessary stress. The purpose of summer is to enjoy a break from school anxiety. If projects do not reflect this, then a student's summer could possibly be ruined. In the end, in order prevent this, talk to your teacher and see if your summer could be saved with an enjoyable, simple, and quick project instead.Â",

      "Throughout a students educational experience, they have the 3 month break at the end of each year that allows them to have time off and have a break from the intense rigor of school. Although, the break can better be purposed by having assignments to further their knowledge during this time period. These projects can best be designed as student led so that students can have more creativity and imagination towards the project, specialize one topic based on future educational interest, and ensures that students have the resources they need to complete the assignment.\n \n From Kindergarten through grade 12, each student is given a curriculum to follow and learn for a standardized test at the end of the year; student led summer projects would allow for a broader outlook on their schooling education and explore topics that would not be looked at otherwise. A student who only learns about their immediate community and ecosystem can gain a broader perspective on society after completing a summer project about an ecosystem in another region of the world. The additional thought and imagination put into a project like this would be hard to complete in an organized project created by a teacher. Furthermore, students commonly bored duringÂ one project that a large group of students have to complete. The rules and rubric which have to be followed deprive the students of exploration and investigation which is crucial for a successful education. Allowing for students to find their choice of exploration and then present it in a unique way brings a complex ideology about interesting topics. Not only is the content of student led projects productive, but so is the way of deriving that information. Commonly, classrooms follow a strict set of rules to ensure each students safety, but those rules come with a cost. The rules cause students to think in one way, act in one way, and test in one specific way. A summer project which gives students space to compete based on their creativity allows them to break out of those boundaries and complete what they want to complete.\n \n A students future college path can also be benefited by student based summer projects due to the option of focusing on their desired topic. As students age into their final years of high school, many already know the path they want to take in college and ultimately their occupations. Giving students an option to focus and research on these topics will not only allow them to understand more about the topic but also build their application to give them a better chance at getting into respected schools. A student who wants to explore the medical pathway might use the summer project as a chance to see what the field is about. That student might shadow surgeons or pediatricians and then analyze and report their findings. The alternate option of teacher led student projects would not allow for this type of unique opportunity. Using the report of their findings, a student can better apply for prestigious college opportunities, scholarships and programs through their past experience that gives them a step up from their competing applicants.\n \n Lastly, the guidelines given to the entirety of the public schooling system leaves students in lower socioeconomic situations to not be able to complete certain projects. The student led project system allows students to find a topic that is accessible for them rather than one that has a large demand for expensive purchases. Certain projects specifically in the science department, require an excessive amount of resources making them hard to obtain out of the school setting. If the teacher led projects would require students to purchase these goods, difficulties would arise in regards to the ability for all students to have access and an abundance of these items. Although supplies may be given through the schooling system, a work spaceÂ might be difficult to obtain as well. Choosing a project that not only gains the students interest but also allows them to complete it with ease displays the benefits of student led projects.\n \n Projects that can be completed during the summer should be led by the students desires and aspirations as it will gain allow for the most success of the student. Student led projects show most effective through the ability for students to use their imagination, research a topic they might study in college, and complete the work productively and efficiently.",

      "Every year students look forward to going on summer break and getting away from school. This three month break often involves forgetting important skills and not learning new information. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to solve these problems. These projects should be teacher-designed to ensure that the project is relevant, has a difficulty on grade level with that of the student, and allows for easy collaboration and communication.\n \n While being able to pick their own topic for a summer project may be more fun for students, a teacher-designed project would insure that the information being learned connects to what they need to know for school. A random project in the middle of break is a waste of time if the teacher cannot connect it to what the students will be learning in class. For example, a physics teacher may want to assign a project to introduce momentum or energy, this will allow students to come into class with a general understanding of the subject. Having a project with a specific learning goal will make students feel as if they are making the most of their time and are learning something that will be useful in the future.\n \n When given the task of creating their own projects, students will often design the easiest project they can get away with. Teachers can ensure appropriate difficulty in the projects by designing them themselves. Projects can be adjusted so they are suitable for different grades and class types; the more difficult the class is, the more difficult the project will be. Students wouldn't be able to complete the easiest project they can or overestimate themselves and design a project too hard.\n \n During the summer it is important for students to be able to contact their teachers and ask for help. If a project is student-designed, a teacher may have difficulty assisting a student if they become confused and need help. A teacher-designed project would make asking for and receiving help a lot easier. If the teacher-designed project were to be uniformly distributed to all students taking similar class, the students would be able to collaborate and ask each other for help as well. Completing the assignment in groups would be more fun for the students and easier to grade for the teachers.\n \n Summer projects need to be teacher-designed so they are on topic, have a reasonable difficulty, and allow for optimal communicate and collaboration. Summer projects are often dreaded by students, but a teacher-designed project is more beneficial than a student-designed project.",

      "After school ends, most children spend their summers relaxing with their friends and family. Not many of us do anything educational on the rare occasion that we may read a book. Because of this, some schools require students to complete summer projects to continue learning during their break. Students should be able to design their own projects because the project itself will be more enjoyable, easier to complete, and more beneficial to students in terms of knowledge.\n \n Many of the projects that teachers assign during the school year are pretty boring. By designing their own summer project, students can have a fun experience with it. Not only that, but students will also be much more inclined to actually do the project. As an AP student, I have been assigned summer assignments for classes, which I ended up doing last minute. These assignments weren't hard, but they ended up being pretty long since we were given two months to complete them. Since I pushed them to the last minute, I was sitting in my house for hours for the last couple of days trying to get these projects done. Now, if I had found a project to do for the class, I would have completed it throughout the course of the break and would have had had a much better time completing it.\n \n Something that we all know is that if you are actually interested in completing the task at hand, you will be much more efficient in completing it rather than a task you are not interested in. Because of this exact reason, students should be able to design their own project because it would be way easier to complete. Not only that, but students will actually feel like its their own task to complete, rather than some random assignment that is assigned by the teacher. Most students, including myself, complete homework for a class the night before its due. Many people think the ideal way of completing homework is to complete it the day it is assigned, but since, most of the time, students aren't really interested in the work, they end up cramming it to a later day. Although, if the student has a task from something that they are interseted in, such as the sport they play, then they will do that as soon as they can.\n \n Another beneficial factor from being able to design your own summer project is that it is much more knowledgeable then a tradtional assignment. What I mean by more knowledgeable is how much knowledge the student actually gains from completing a specific assignment. A particular assignment may require research that allows students to gain a lot of knowldedge, but if the student is bored by the topic, then they will just try to finish the assignment by whatever means possible. They will not try to learn the topic, and will probably end up getting the answers online or from a friend. If we compare this to another scenerio where the assignment pertains less information, but actually interests the student, then the student will definetely walk away with much more knowledge than they did before. Because of this, students should be able to design their own summer projects.\n \n Many people think that if students design their own summer projects, then they will just goof around and try to pick a very easy topic. This is arguable, as teachers can easily set boundaries for their students and have certain requirements such as having a minimum word count, page count, etc. All in all, students can have a good time and gain plently of knowledge if they are able to design their own summer project.Â",

      "Summer projects must be designed by teachers or the whole thing will be pointless. It is said there are many contraversial points that would lead folks to not taking a side on whether students should design summer projects, or if teachers should. However, projects need to be designed and assigned by teachers because it will set the standard of validation, express uniqueness and diversity, and reduce chances of cheating.\n \n First, having summer projects designed by teachers sets the tone on what the outcome should look like and how well a student must do. This prevents student's from simply waiting until the last week of summer and sloppily making a project that is eventually accepted by a teacher. Also, this action will assure the continued process of students learning while on summer break. The whole point of summer projects is so the students keep their minds fresh and ready for the next year, and If the students design the projects, that may not happen.\n \n Next up, teachers will find expressions of uniqueness and diversity in the results they recieve from the students. Every kid is different, and a teacher should be able to recognize that kids best interests and strongest characteristics. With that being known, teachers can design and assign summer projects accordingly. With every kid either working on a project that includes something they are comfortable with, or something they might need to work on more to be successful. This also reveals the different mindsets and creative skills a classroom holds, while a student designed project may just be basic and super boring.\n \n Last, the amount of cheating is bound to decrease when projects are designed by students. If a kid designed his own project over a span of a couple months, there's a big possibility he may cheat. These kids may also \"accidentally\" choose the same topic to work on all summer. There are endless possibilities and ways for a students to get away with the easy way out. Which is why, when a teacher assigns different topics and types of projects to a wide variety of students, it reduces cheating. This ultimately does help the students learn how to try new things, even if they aren't familier with it.\n \n Although this may be true, many believe that when teachers assign and or design summer projects for students, it will come out boring and no fun. People also believe it won't bring out the creative side in a student. But, the understanding of a student being creative and crafty is how they handle something that is thrown at them. The creativeness that lies in a student is how they can transform something out of their interest into something they can enjoy. Teacher designed projects bring out the capability of a kid and what that kid can truly do.\n \n All in all, summer projects are genuinely more productive and useful when designed by a teacher. It gives the students a chance to be creative and show unique skills, reduces the amount of unloyal actions such as cheating and working together, and it sets the standard for a student to meet. To all teachers who will read this, I advise you to keep the power in your hands. Bring out that student's inner strengths and challenge that student. One day, that student will thank you for not letting them take the easy way out.",

If the project is teacher designed then it gives no way for the students to express their creativity. By allowing students to design their own project they will have a way to voice their opinions on something they may be concerned or upset about. It would also allow students to design a project about something that may interest them.\n \n If students design their own project they can voice their opinions on something there concerned about. Say for instance a student was worried about people speeding through his neighborhood. He could make his project about that concern and talk about ways or measures that should be put in place to prevent it from happening. This would also make the student work harder due to the fact that this is a problem that the student faces and would want people to know about that problem so that others can be informed on that issue.\n \n Student designed projects allow students to create a project on a subject that interests them. For example,say a student is interested in becoming a mechanic after they are done with school. If they research and design a project on that subject it can give them an outlook into the future if that is an occupation they are interested in. It can also give them a head startÂ in that career path with the knowledge they would learn from creating the project.\n \n If the project is teacher designed it can help students get ready for next year with school related material.

      "Summer projects keep the mind sharp. However often tedious, summer projects can often be beneficial as it can prepare the students for the following year or preferebly life. Some believe that these projects should be teacher designed so that students have the base kowledge on what will be covered that year, however that's not what learning is about. Learning is a life long journey not a journey to the next test. If these summer projects were student designed, where students had the freedom to choose, they could work on a something they truly found interesting. These projects could give them life experience rather than school experience.\n \n Firstly, these summer projects can be anything from work experiece to writing a noval. For example if a student loved to write and thought they may have a carreer as a jounalist or even an author they may decide their time was best spent on sharpening those skills. Not only would their time be spent to make themselves a better writer but also they would excited to do the work. However what if a student decides to make their project a job or even an internship at some law firm, well that is even better. These students will come back to school with more maturity, life experience and perhaps some money in the bank.\n \n Another outcome of student designed summer projects is rather than coming back the school with dred and resentment, they'll come back excited to showcase what they've learned. For example if teachers assigned a massive work load on everything they might need to pass the tests during the year, students will be anxious, unmotivated and stressed by the first day of school. This would kill students desire to learn and cause resentment towards teachers. However, if students can come back to school with the confidence that they are able to learn and experiece things by themselves, students will come into school postive and inspired to learn rather than being negative and unmotivated.\n \n Finally, there is a difference between schooling and learning. Schooling is a soley a tool to educate individuals however it is temporary. Learning is rather a life long jouney, something that should never stop. There is learning before school such as when you learned to walk and talk for the first time and then there is learning after school when you get a job or simply when you read a book. That is why summer projects should be the students responsibility, so that they can learn to learn by themselves. Sadly too many students believe that learning and schooling are the same thing and their life long jouney ends once they leave school.\n \n In conclusion, summer projects should be the students responsibility. These summer projects should inspire students to learn and experience new things. The goal is to have students motivated when they return to school rather than stressed and anxious for the year to end. Lastly learning is a life long jouney, schooling is temporary.",

      "One of the most truly modern American experiences has got to be voicing one's opinion on a subject they have little to know knowlege or experience with to the world. Unfortunately, today my opinion will not be voiced to the world as this is a SOL test, but it will be a scarecly informed opinion for sure. I have the privilige of never being assigned a project by a school over the summer, but today's prompt has drawn something to my attention that I never quite thought about before- That these summer projects assigned by schools should absolutely be designed by the students who have to do them as they can then be tailored to fit the students interests and schedules, within reason of course.\n \n Starting off positive, the most obvious pro of student designed summer projects is the creative liberty. Students would not only be free to pick whatever topic or subject they like, but the form their project takes. A student could go the conventional route and do a presentation with a trifold or something similar, or go in the opposite direction and hold a workshop explaining why purple light doesn't technically exist, complete with interactive features. They may even incorporate their other summer activities into their project, as a student traveling to France for the summer might research a part of French history and include their own photos that they took that relate to the topic. Speaking of other summer activities, students with jobs, internships, or anything else that may take up multiple hours of the day could then ensure that the project they give themself is something that they can handle.\n \n Now that I've explained all the wonderful pros of student designed projects, lets reign it back in a bit and disscuss the cons and some solutions to those cons along with my mildly valid expertise. I've been a girl scout since I was in elementary school and for the past few summers been doing research for a gold award project, the highest honor that a girl scout can earn. The main focus of a gold award is of course the project, which is designed entirely by the scout, may take anywhere from a couple of months to a year, and a proposal of said project has to be approved by a council.\n \n Granted, this is on a bit of a larger scale compared to a school summer project, but there are some good ideas that could be drawn from this. Approval of the project idea could ensure that the projects have genuine learning value, and could be approved by the student's counselor. Conselors would then also see to that students give themselves proper workloads, ensuring that they don't overwork themselves, or take the easy route either. Putting a deadline on the approval might also help encourage students to at least think about their project a bit before the night it's due. Gold awards also look good on college applications, and allowing students to make their projects something that they would be so proud of to put on a college application could be a boost in motivation for those college-bound.\n \n The concept of allowing students to have this much control over a project as we move towards an education system where the students are being allowed more control and freedom day by day can be truly great when done correctly. Which can absolutely happen, when necessary restraints are given. It simply requires more work on everyone's part, and considering that educational instititions are supposed to be preparing entire generations for life itself, and not just a workplace or university, that shouldn't be too hard? Perhaps I put too much faith in this but I truly do hope to see the day when students are proactive enough to go about these sorts of things on their own, not for a grade or award, but to better themselves and the world around them.",

    ESSAY:
      "Summer break is a long three months away from school for students to relax, learn new skills and enjoy themselves. Most students tend to forget everything they are taught throughout the school year over this break. Summer break to majority of students is time for having the best time of their lives doing all the things they love which hardly ever includes academic work. Teacher-designed summer projects would be a very effective way to ensure students keep receiving knowledge throughout their summer break because education is a continuous process. Teachers would be the best choice to design these summer projects because they thoroughly know the syllabus of the course they teach, they would give realistic projects students can complete on time and teachers would be fair in selecting the type and criteria of the project.\n \n Teachers have all the information about the courses they teach and what their students need to know each year. Teacher-designed projects would entail the necessary topics and lessons for students to work on during their summer break. Other people might argue that the students are also well informed about what they are being taught so should create their own summer projects but most students might just have an idea about what they need to know but might not know about the course in detail as much as the teacher does with all their years of experience and trying new approaches to figure out what works best for their students. Students might also just want to create projects that would be very easy to complete just so they can get it over with. At the end of the day if students are allowed to create their own projects they end up learning nothing new because it was based on stuff they already knew. For example a Geometry teacher teaching tenth graders would not create a math project for tenth grade students based on sixth grade math because that is way below them.\n \n With teacher designed-projects they are more likely to have realistic amount of work and would be possible for students to complete and meet the goal at the end of the break, teachers would most definitely not give too much work to overburden students since they also need some rest or too little work to students but give them just enough work for the break. But if student-designed projects are used students are more likely to create very short and straight to the point projects because most students are lazy and just do not want to be bothered with any work so would not want to challenge themselves to research and do more but would want very few questions that would not need any serious thinking and application of knowledge. A teacher who teaches a 12th grade English class could give a summer project for students to read and summarize a book of their choice and find out the meanings of 20 new words in the book but students would have probably wanted a project where they just write out ten new words from the book they read.\n \n Every student always wants the easy way out of everything so if allowed to create a summer project would just create a project based on what they are very good at for example; a project with artwork, a crossword puzzle or a project about their own sentences and this would lead to a disagreement among the students to pick the best project which would be good for everyone. However, a teacher would not be biased in choosing a summer project for their students, they would assign a project based on skills all their students are expected to know or already have without picking out what some particular people would want in that class.\n \n Ultimately, teachers know the best approaches and methods when it comes to projects for their students because they have worked with many different students over the years and came up with very effective teacher-designed summer projects to help their students keep learning over the break without stressing them.

      "During the school year, a student completes set projects and curriculum in order to pass the classes which they are enrolled in. Over the summer, however, some schools require that projects should be assigned to students so that they continue to learn. I think that these projects should be student-designed because they will allow students to explore new fields, inspire creativity, and take away stress from students.\n \n Student designed projects will allows students to explore new fields that they may be interested in. If students are able to design their own summer projects, then they are able to choose a topic that is interesting to them for this project. This will allow the student to explore, research, and experiment within new fields. This exploration and research of new fields is very beneficial because it helps students find a career path based on what topics they are interested in.\n \n Having student-designed summer projects will inspire creativity. If a student is able to create their own project without need of a rubric or teacher to guide them, then this project is truly coming from the student. This will allow students to really show themselves when completing these projects. If students are just given a teacher-designed project, they are just following a rubric and completing what the teacher wants them to do. This work can be numb and boring for the students who could be using all their creativity on their own self-designed project.\n \n Student-designed projects will take away a lot of the stress that some students have during normal teacher-designed projects. Students will be less focused on doing everything right since the project is designed by them. These students will instead be able to focus on learning the material instead of stressing over getting a good grade. This will improve both the students mental health and the value in learning the student is actually receiving from a project.\n \n Schools should allow these summer projects to be student-designed. Although some may argue that teacher-designed projects are better because it guarantees that a student will learn a specific curriculum, student-designed summer projects have so many more benefits. I believe that these projects should be student-designed because they will allow students to explore new fields, inspire creativity, and take away stress from students",

      "The summer project is something that often looms over the minds' of students. We often find students bellyaching about how they are missing out on fun summer activities. More often than not, it is the teachers who assign the projects, and even though teachers are more educated on certain subjects, it would be appropriate to believe that students should design summer projects. This sort of activity over the summer would promote individuality, entrepreneurship, and personal responsibility.\n \n Some people think that individuality is not necessary in an industrial world, but really, it is the backbone of this nation and student designed projects promote such individuality. In the long term, individuality leads to higher paying jobs in the future. It is well known that if more people have high paying jobs, there will be less homelessness and a stimulated economy. As well, creativity stems from a sense of individuality. Fine arts are the future of the world as we are getting closer to not needing hard labor. The arts also jump startÂ economic progress by putting more money into the system. All this individuality leads to entrepreneurship.\n \n There is an argument to be made that not all students will be entrepreneurs, but it is important to nurture entrepreneurial practices, which can be done through aforementioned student designed projects. Entrepreneurs tend to be better off in the real world. This may sound repetitive, but we really need more people with big ideas so that the world can progress. The loss of this kind of person means the loss of all those years spent building the world from the ground up. As well, the process of designing a project could lead to students designing a business in the future. The process for creating such projects is quite involved, and it leads to more focused adults in the future. In reality though, none of this would be possible without a sense of personal responsibility.\n \n Many people in this modern world believe that the only way to become more responsible is to get a job, and while this is partially accurate, projects such as this will always nurture responsibility. For example, completion of projects lead to the student feeling more accomplished. That sense of accomplishment make students feel like accomplishing more will make them feel even better, leading to them being more responsible with projects in their future. As well, project planning in youth will lead to the individual taking charge within projects in their future. It is important to have students be proactive in their career as it will likely lead to better positions and better pay.\n \n To finish, responsibility will only develop if you let your student take charge, be it in a career or in a project. While some people may disagree, this is the truth, hard work cannot do all the heavy lifting. As a country we need to develop our youths' sense of entrepreneurship,individuality, and personal responsibility or else we will not progress as a people.",

      "Students-designed projects should always be assigned even during the school year. Students-design are more understandable that teacher-design. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Projects should be student-design so they can relate more, showcase your creativity and skills, and be more exciting for the students.\n \n Even though, teacher-design projects will be able to test our knowledge. They are not made for children the way a student- design would be. Student- design projects will relate to students more because it will be base around us. We will have total control, unlike how sum teacher-design projects have rules and guidelines that stop us from being fully open. For, example i had to do a ESSAY about my summer adventures. I chose to write about the time i visited my grandparents in Florida. A few days went by and my teacher wanted to talk to me. She wanted me to rethink my ESSAY because she did not feel any excitement reading it. I didn't agree with her because i always had fun with my grandparents. We would feed the sea turtles, go on night walks at the beach, and go to the board walk's carnival. She still felt as if i wasn't meet the project requirements. This project played a important role in my grade, so i accepted it and rewrote my ESSAY.\n \n In addition student-based projects will show how creative we are. This will give students the opportunity to show off their talent and ideas. Teacher- designed projects do not always allow students to show what they are fully capable of, it only shows what they want to see. Such as, my friend Generic_Name had to do a portraitÂ for her finals in art. She sketched an amazing portrait with a lotÂ of details, so she could show her skills off. This was very risky, to much detail could throw the sketch off. Her adviser thought that she should do something simple to ensure she will get an easy A. Generic_Name wanted more that a easy grade, she wanted her artwork to inspire people and toÂ make a mark, so she went with her idea instead. Now her paint is hanging in the museum of art and is displayed every month downtown.\n \n Next, Student-designed projects will be way more fun and entertaining for students. Every year we receive projects that are boring and does not interest us. Teacher-designed project have no personality and are way to formal. Students-designed projects can be more funny, silly and excited, it can bring happiness back to school projects. For example, two teachers, Generic_Name and Generic_Name assigned the same project. Generic_Name gave her students a teacher-designed project, but Generic_Name didnt. She let her students chose their own project and gave them a rubric of what she would be looking for. Generic_Name class's project still related to science but was personalized. It showed that they really tried and had fun doing this project. She had never seen so many smiles on students faces as they presented their projects. It showed her that she made the right chose.\n \n In conclusion, these are all the reason why we should get student-designed projects. It is showed that student- designed projects can help and motivate students. Projects should be student-design so they can relate more, showcase your creativity and skills, and be more exciting for the students. In the end this will be the best for students.",

      "Most schools require students to complete summer projects. Over the years, there has been a debate if these programs should be student-taught or teacher- taught. Summer projects should be teacher- designed because, teachers have a greater knowledge of the subject, are trained to keep kids engaged, and know how to plan a lesson that students can relate to worldly.\n \n Teachers all around the world study the subject(s) that they teach. This gives them greater knowledge than any student would have. Most teachers are required to graduate college, and get a teaching degree as well, (some teachers even get their masters). That is more years of studying a single subject than any high schoolÂ studentÂ may have. Studying this single subject for many years, gives them a lot of experience, and specific knowledge to help educate a student on the subject. Although students can always learn the material, they may not have as great of knowledge as a teacher on one specific subject. Teachers have at least four years of knowledge that a students don't and thats why they're better teachers than a student.\n \n Along with four years of college, teachers must receive a teaching degree. While studying for this degree, teachers learn how to plan out lessons, and keep kids engaged. A teacher would better keep kids engaged, because they are trained to keep kids focused, and keep them involved in the material they learn in class. Weather this is; keeping kids involved in class by doing a project that is hands on, or having them start conversation to create development of their skills and knowledge. Some may argue that students would keep kids more engaged, due to how they can relate to kids their own age, teachers can relate to students too. Teachers know what its like to goo through schooling, because they had to do it too. Teachers are trained to keep students entertained, and develop their skills inside and out of the classroom.\n \n Most teachers enjoy learning about their subject they teach daily, this keeps their material relevant and reputable. Making sure that the teachers material is relevant, helps kids from around the world be able to relate to the lessons. Mr. Generic_Name, is a second grade teacher at Generic_School. Over the summers he likes to practice his teaching, by traveling the world to see if his material is still relevant in other countries. Many teachers will do this to ensure that what theyre teaching their class is resignatingÂ with each student. Keeping teachers' content relevant is a sure way to keep kids relating to the topic.\n \n Summer rprojects should be relatable, engaging, and well taught. That's why Teachers should teach Summer Projects. They've had years of experince, teachers can relate to kids, keep them engaged, and create lessons that relate to the world. Teachers are the best fit to direct summer projects.Â",

I believe summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to be more involved in what there learning and it also allows students to learn at there own speed and level.\n \n My first reason on why summer projects should be student-designed is that it allows the student to be more involvedÂ in what there learning. For example if a student receives a summer project from he or she's teacher it's highly likely that the project will be focused on everything that the student has learned before the summer. But what if the student dose not need to learn everything what if they only need to focus on certain thing that they are struggling with that's why I believe that student-designed projects would benefit students better; because it give them the opertuntitieÂ to create a project that can focus on things that they are struggling with and improve upon it.\n \n Another reason I believe summer projects should be student-designed is because it allows students learn at there own speed and level. I personally believe that the summer projects that are given to student are pretty challenging and a lotÂ of students and because of this a lotÂ of student either decides not to do the project or they cheat and end up not learning anything; thats why I feel so strongly that student should be allowed to choose and designed there own projects i believe this will help students learn without being overwhelmedÂ or overly challenged. On the other hand teacher may feel that if theyÂ designed the projects that it will be better for students and they also may feel that overly challenging students is a good thing because it put students in a position to challenge themselves and to learn at a higher level; and while statement has a pointÂ I still have to disagree because while its true that some students may benefit from this there are still a lot of students who wont I believe that a student my first master the level that there at now in order to proceed into a higher level of education.\n \n These are all the reasons i believeÂ summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to be more involved in what there learning and it also allows students to learn at there own speed and level.Â Â",

      "Summer assignments are never fun and many students can agree with that statement. Even though they are beneficial to continue your learning throughout your break. Summer assignments should be designed by the teachers of the course due to the fact that they are familiar with the curriculum, they understand what is needed to be tested on throughout the course, and the teacher knows what the students are capable of doing.\n \n Teachers are familiar with the curriculum and know what needs to be on your assignment to ensure that you are successful in the class. The teachers have learned that topic and are experts on the subject. Going to a college and receiving a higher education in a certain topic makes the professor best fit to decide what you should learn during your break off from school. For example in a AP Human Geography class the summer assignment was to fill in maps of the world and fill out chapter guides for the first two units. In doing this the students became familiar with the content which makes them more likely to receive a higher grade and a better understanding of the unit. This proves that when the teacher designs the assignment they are leading you to become more familiar and successful in your learning.\n \n Teachers know what is being tested in a course and what is expected for the student to know. Teachers have to teach certain things to the students while following a guideline. This tells the teacher what the student should know by the end of the year. By giving the students a summer assignment that lets them be ahead and know certain topic then it benefits the students and makes them receive a better understanding of the curriculum. In most courses there are online resources that allow the teacher to know what should be taught by the end of the year and what should be taught in a certain state. This helps the teacher decide what the summer assignments should be. Some students may think that a student-designed assignment would be easier and more beneficial. This is incorrect due to the fact that the students aren't familiar with the subject or what needs to be taught. The students also aren't responsible enough to decide what needs to be learned over their break.\n \n Teacher understand the students position since they were all in the same place at a certain point in time, therefore they will assign what they know the student is capable of doing without overwhelming them. The teacher will give the student a doable amount of work that will benefit them without stressing and overwhelming them. A teacher that taught AP Human Geo at a high school understood that students wanted a break from school and they didn't want to do useless work that wouldn't help them. Therefore he gave them a good amount of work that they could finish and learn from.\n \n Summer assignments should be teacher-designed due to the fact that teachers understand the students and understand the curriculum so they can balance an assignment that benefits the students. Teachers are more familiar with the subject and know what the students will be tested on, therefore the assignments will have a good purpose. Teachers should make the assignments because they are experts on the topics and have the students interests at heart so they can help them.",

Some schools require students to complete projects over the summer. People debate on whether the project should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Summer projects should be student-designed because it would allow the student to be more creative, do a project they would enjoy, and gives students more independence.\n \n If students were to be required to make a summer project and it was student-designed, it would let students be more creative. Most teachers and parents want their student/child to think outside the box. A student led project would make students use their brain more, during their 2 month long break of not doing anything. The project would allow students to develop an independent mind. They would give a nudge for students to get out of their comfort zone. The project would make students think more independently at a younger age. As they get older, they will be more inclined to do things out of their comfort zone. Supporting a student to lead his summer project would make the next generation more creative.\n \n A student led summer project would allow students to pick a topic they would enjoy. Majority of people will produce quality work if they have a passion for it. People like to work on projects they enjoy and can open their minds to. If someone likes a subject they will most likely want to pursue that subject. Some students will find the topics a teacher gives them boring and unmotivating. This is due to the fact that one person cannot satisfy everyone in the room. If a student doesn't like a topic they will not enjoy it and it will not accurately represent their academic skills. Allowing students to lead their own summer projects, means they will pick something they will enjoy and have a passion for.\n \n Doing a student led summer project would give students more independence. Students would have to take more responsibility. If a student were to do bad on a project they would have to take responsibility for their actions. It would train the next generation to take responsibility instead of blaming someone else. This would give students more preparation for the adult life. They school system gives little to no preparation on how to manage an adult life, but it would give students a little more experience for the students. A project like this would give people a little nudge to grow up gradually. Summer projects would give more independence, if it was student led.\n \n Student led summer projects would, overall, allow students to be more creative, do something they enjoy, and give students more independence.

      "Should schools require students complete summer projects during the summer? Honestly I think if your behind like at the end of the year you could do these summer projects to get you caught up, that would help a lot of students like me. I think they should be designed by the students after all it's our summer. I just dont think school should be pushing us like that we're to young for that. They already keep us in school for about eight or nine months then most students work really hard to get to where they need/want to be.\n \n Me personally, I would want the teachers to design the projects but only since its summer I would not be ok with that. Most students put in so much work just to get a couple more pointless projects during the summer at lease if the the students design it will be something simple, but not to simple. I already know if the teachers design it would be something that's so difficult and extra and it's the summer so they will say something like you had all the time in the world to complete this. But thats not how its supposed to be it should be something I could complete in a week or two. We shouldnt have to go to school for that long just to get stuck with some summer projects design by some teachers that probably dont even know me.\n \n Maybe if the teachers and the students designed the projects together we could come up with something. I would not care if it wasn't the summer but I can't lie projects in the summer would be smart. The only thing is I feel like the teacher would just throw something at us. If it was graded like extra credit or something when school start that would be way more motivation to get ahead way before school even start. Sometimes we just need a break, just a small one because we do so much in and out of school y'all teachers and staff don't know what goes on out of school, they never do.\n \n In conclusion, students should design their own summer projects but the teachers should check of on them to make sure they're not to easy. We work hard through out the school year just to get to the summer and i dont think it should be to hard for them or to long. During school, most teachers gives us little time to do the most difficultÂ projects in the school year, just like last year. Even tho we should be relaxing in the summer this is kind of a neat idea and would keep us on task for the next school year.

Others think it'll be a horrible assignment because the teacher is creating the requirements. If students really pay attention to what's happening they'll realize the teacher is making the class do less work compared to what students wanted. Summer projects should be teacher designed because they have more experience, they'll make sure the class covers new material, and it'll be easier for teachers to grade.\n \n Teachers know what results they want when it comes down to projects. They've went to college, learned about designing projects, and spent their time and money on being taught how to grade and make assignments. The school faculty know our strengths and weaknesses, what we need and what we don't, teachers have walked in our shoes. They know what students want before the students know.\n \n The schools number one priority is to teach and make students learn new information. Teachers know how to introduce new topics, ideas, and questions that'll force students to use their brain. They're aware of what children know and don't know. Teachers know that it would take too long for students to make their assignment because they haven't been taught how to grade or make a rubric to grade with.\n \n Having the teachers design the project will be easier for them to grade. They know what they want to look for in the assignment. Teachers teach, make assignments, and grade for a living, and they know what to expect. The school faculty know what we'll achieve and what we'll fail at, they making rubrics and grading systems designed for students.\n \n However, students would have fun inventing their own requirements for the assignment, but students just use what they already know. Teachers will make sure others learn because that's their job. They'll have students focus on the project, and not creating it.\n \n In conclusion, having the teacher design the classes summer project makes it easier for you and your teacher.

    ESSAY:
      "Giving teachers an extra task like designing a summer based project can be hard or easy it really just depends on how you look at the situation. Teachers assignÂ projects all year, so this should be no different. There are many types of teachers that teach many different subjects that have to be remembered. Students are expected to learn numerous things in just one school year, so being assigned a summer project covering everything and adding in new topics can generate ideas for students and get them to researching on their own and teaching them selfÂ things they never knew. Teachers will be available for emails from students and or parents to ask for help or a guiding hand. A lot of the time students are asked questions by teachers throughout the school year on things they were not taught or on things they cannot remember, so being assigned a project that is in dept could save them from that one embarrassmentÂ in front of their classmates.\n \n First, students will be introduced to new topics in their project. This will get students to thinking and they will want to research since technology is the biggest thing right now. This will result in them participating and they will find out new information while completing their work. The new topics will help them learn stuff that is expected to be covered. The remembering will be first priority in their project. Students will have a variety of topics in each subject and they will be expected to complete it fully. No student is allowed to leave anything undone or uncompleted. Each student is encouraged to email their teacher or research the topics and find out any information, just saying they did not understand or they did not know what to put will be unacceptable.\n \n Secondly, every teacher will be expected to leave contact information to be reached. Students are only expected to contact their teacher for help on his or her project. This is given to every student but mainly for ones without internet. There are also students who do not have parents or anyone they can rely on to help them so the teachers information is there for anyone nobody is singled out. Parents that graduated years ago may not be able to include input to their children work because they were not taught the same or know many of the things students are taught now so they are more than welcome to contact teachers for any information pertaining to the subject, this will maybe even help parents learn something.\n \n Students should create their own projects to show what they learned all year and what they do not know. Not every child needs a guiding hand or someone to lead them in the right direction. Each student can come up with their own project to show that they remember important lessons from class meetings. The teachers should not have to take their summer time to email parents and students back about things they were taught while in school. On the other hand, few students make it to class everyday to be apart of the class discussionsÂ and are not allowed to hear the notes. A lot of the things that teachers go over during class is not put into the missing work folder. The teacher could have given out many really important points that any student could have easily not paid any attention to, misheard, or was not in class to hear. Being assigned this project can help many students learn new things or relearn something they probably did not understand.\n \n To conclude this, teacher-designed projects can not only benefit students it helps them relearn things they did not understand. Nobody is perfect and anyone is capable of not knowing the right information due to miscommunication. It is alright to ask for help if you do not understand it is recommend to students. Some things can be self taught, but still not fully understood. Having a teacher that is willing to put in the effort to help his or her students shows dedication and any student should be thankful and take the help. By the end of the school year students are probally burnt out with tons of work and this project could bring back so much information that was covered.Â",

      "Some schools will assign students projects over summer break to assure they will continue to learn school subjects. Summer is a long time and will give the students enough time to learn what is needed. There is a small debate as to whether the students or the teachers should design these projects. Although many teachers will assign and create these projects because they can make sure the students will learn what they need to learn, students should design these projects because many teachers will give to big of a project, many students might not have enough time to work on said project, and giving the student the ability to create the project will assure it can get done.\n \n The first reason to support this claim is that teachers may give to big of a project. Normally, teacher will give a student a project to work on and learn but there is no telling how big that project could be. The teacher could say to create 1 deck of study cards or to write a 10 page ESSAY on something that student may not have learned about. And many times the student may not get the project done in a way the teacher likes because they did not get a chance to go over something like that. Lastly, sometimes the student can get anxious or nervous about having to create a project as big or small as the teacher assigns.\n \n Secondly, a student may not have the time to work on a big project. Teachers look forward to the summer just as much as kids do. Summer is a time to hang out with family or earn some money at a job. Many students simply will not have enough time to worry about creating a big school project. Everyone has responsibilities, like work, family, or just household tasks, and lots of people can not make enough time to work on summer projects. Also depending on how big the assigned project will be and how many teachers assign projects can be to much and give a student not enough time to complete them all.\n \n Lastly, if a students designs a project they can make it so that it can revolve around their schedule. A teacher will normally give students a big project and expect it to be done without thinking about how a student has a life outside of school just like a teacher. For the majority of students, they are too busy with summer responsibilities to be able to work on a teacher assigned school project. If a student is given the right to create their own project, following some small steps from the teacher, there is a higher chance that the student will get the project done rather than not complete it.\n \n In conclusion, students should be able to assign and create their own projects. Many reasons include how big the project is, how much time it will take, and how much time the student can work on it. So to make it easier on everyone, students should be able to make their own projects that can revolve around their own lives and responsibilities.Â",

      "Summer is the time of year where students all over the world finally get to relax. They do not have to worry about any responsibilities; they can just remember what it means to be a kid. However, some schools are allowed to assign projects over summer. If kids are required to constantly be thinking about school and work, they should at least be enjoying it. Students should self design any projects assigned over summer because its their own free time, everyone has unique learning styles, and teachers aren't always considerate.\n \n Children care about their summer vacations, because it is the only time they are truly free. A student looks forward to this vacation throughout the whole school year. They wait patiently, completing every assignment and every test, just so they can play outside in the summer sunshine. These kids don't want to finally get out of school to only have to complete yet another assignment. If the kids are having to do this project on their own break, they should at least be able to choose what they do. For example, if a student is assigned a project over summer from biology, they should be able to pick to do an animal studies on their own dog. An animal they know well, love, and actually would enjoy researching. Kids having to spend their vacation working should be able to choose what to work on.\n \n Kids want to play, so they should be able to and have a project that adapts to their learning style. Every student learns differently. Having a project created by one teacher would be unfair to everyone else who doesn't think the same way. Allowing students to have some decision in what they do would be most effective in actually teaching them. Every mind learns differently and needs creative thinking involved to begin working. If kids were allowed to come up with their own projects, it would be much better than a teacher-designed project. The kids would not think of it as homework, but instead as something they want to do.\n \n Teachers don't always know whats best for their students. Many teachers may just assign homework because they need more grades in the grade book. They don't always consider if it's necessary for the students learning. They don't think about the stress that homework inflicts on it's victims. If teachers were to create a project for students to complete over summer, it would cause lots of stress and resentment. Although, letting the kids design their own projects would help build a better bond between kids and learning. Teachers would then get a better feel for each student and see how each of their individual minds work. Letting kids design their own projects would also reduce the amount of work and stress teachers have to endure. Having to come up with a project that would be easy for every student to complete is hard as it is. Having to do this before a teachers own vacation is just torture. It would be a win win situation if the kids got to design the project.\n \n If it was required that a kid got a summer project, it should be student designed. Kids are not thrilled about getting homework over their vacation, and they may not put their best effort. However, If the kids had the option to create their own project it would spark much more creativeness. Teachers would better understand their students and get a break from all the regulating. Both students and teachers would benefit from a student-designed project.",

      "Are students responsible enough to design their own school projects? Numerous schools require students to complete projects over the summer to ensure learning, but this method may be ineffective. If students were given the freedom to design their own projects it would lead to greater performance due to the likelihood that students will pick topics that interest them, that projects would be generalized to help students in the fields with which they require assistance, and the possibility of students forgetting about the project would be lower if they actively worked on it.\n \n However, some may disagree with this viewpoint. Some may say that designing their own projects provides students with an opportunity toÂ pick an easy topic with which they will not be challenged. Nevertheless there are other viewpoints to consider.\n \n Firstly, students, when given the opportunity, will always choose to work on a topic that interests them. Studies show that working with a topic that interest them improves the performance of students while also increasing the possibility of them making an effort to complete their work. However, this is not the only reason why students should design their own summer projects.\n \n Additionally, while some may argue that students would choose to work on topics which they find easy, the chance of a class of students all thriving in the same subjects is highly improbable. Due to the fact that some students will choose to work in subjects which they don't find challenging, students may end up choosing topics which challenge their peers and inadvertently create a project which is all encompassing. But these are not the only reasons students should design their own summer projects.\n \n Finally when any person puts considerable effort into something it causes information related to the subject becomes learned more easily. This is one of the reasons why teachers use methods such as taking notes to reinforce what students are learning. So, logically a group of students working together to choose a topic and subject which they are all satisfied with will reinforce the knowledge of such a project and therefore decrease the likelihood that students will forget about their summer projects thereby improving results.\n \n However, there are many more reasons that students should design their own summer projects.\n \n InÂ conclusion, students should have a hand in creating their own summer projects to choose topics which interest them, as well as to increase the likelihood of them completing said projects, and finally create a project in which all students may both thrive and struggle.",

      "Summer projects should be student-designed. No student likes to do projects in the summer, Students will require motivation and excitement. If students can design their own project, they can be different and more creative. Students enjoy tasks where there's no limit as to what they can do; it gives them the opportunity to try something new. This gives teachers less work and students a more thoughtful tasks. Overall, this will give students a reason to learn, even during they're break.\n \n This is a good way to assure students are still learning. It also gives the students more of a challenge and prepare them for the following school year. Students can use this as a way to see how they're doing and also to stay involved in school. If it were a teacher-designed project, most students wouldnt participate. Since the students are the ones designing it, it'll give them a little more excitement and control over the project.\n \n Students tend to work harder and be more creative when it is a self-designed project. This will open more opportunities and more ideas. Designing your own project gives students the freedom and control that they love. For example, the few times I've been able to design my own project I always put forth more effort and creativity; This is because students love to try different things and be in control. This is important because it teaches students valuable skills that they may need in the real world.\n \n If students are interested and have ideas, summer projects can be really beneficial. Allowing students to create their own project is a great way to interest them. Students tend to work best when they have their own ideas, it's a lot easier and gives the student more freedom. This can teach students to be more independent and hardworking.\n \n A project can show effort and knowledge, when students create their own it shows their best work. It allows students to show what they are capable of. That is why I believe students should design their own project. Â Â",

      "Throughout the school year, both staff and students await summers warm arrival. As the incoming heat and sunscreen draws the final semester to an end, the dreaded thoughts of summer projects spread. Whether it be summer-readings or instructional packets, several high schools urge, if not require, teachers to assign summer projects to assure continuous learning over the two month break. Recently, however, students have debated that these projects should be student-designed rather than teacher-designed. Designing their own projects would allow students to pursue topics they interest, the creative freedom that makes their projects unique, and ensure each students ability to complete projects with the resources available to them.\n \n Often times students are required to complete a project they lack interest in. A 2013 study confirms that when students are given the opportunity to design individual assignments, they are 78% more inclined to participate and are confident of their final product. If a particular student is interested in basketball, they would be more willing to read a book and write an accompanying paper about its history rather than Mary Shelly's\n \n Frankenstein . A students eagerness to learn in specific topics strengthens their work and ensures their growth and success before the new school year.\n \n Equally as important as topic diversity is topic delivery. Reading a book and writing a paper confirming your completion year after year does little to stimulate a students brain. Offering students the creative freedom to complete their summer project will further invest them into their topic. Say a student is interested in film and designs their project on studyingÂ its evolution; instead of writing a paper, the student could make a video presentation featuring different clips and information. Allowing students to broaden their horizons will encourage critical thinking and result in a more stimulated head spaceÂ when returning to school.\n \n Another important consideration is whether or not students can access the necessary resources to complete a teacher-designed project. Several high school students are not fortunate enough to purchase a summer-reading book, supplies for a poster board, or the internet to construct a paper. When completing the project isn't a viable option, the opportunity to design their own allows them to use resources already available to them and avoid lowering their grade.\n \n Although student-designed summer projects are proven to aid learning in more ways than one, schools are still hesitant to make the shift. Teachers rebuttal saying teacher-designed projects would provide students with relevant prepÂ work for their next course and avoid any inappropriate topics that fail to exhibit student growth. Students agreed and offered to solve the inevitable conflict: students have the option of of either completing a teacher-designed project or designing and their own as long as it is teacher-approved prior to schools end.\n \n Maintaining academic activity is key to achieving higher grades and retaining long termÂ information. Even in the summer, students should practice this with assigned summer projects. Though teacher-designed projects aid a students transition into the next year, these projects can be repetitive and may struggle to entice or stimulate students. When students themselves design one, however, the passion for their topics, creative delivery, and avoiding any hindrance on unavailable necessities allow them to learn while still fulfilling what summer is all about: having fun!",

      "Summer break. The most sought after break by any student at any level. Days spent by the pool, hours of hanging with friends, and nights that run into the morning. Summer is where all knowledge learned during the previous year goes down the drain. To counter this, teachers assign summer projects. These projects are normally easy but require much time. Summer projects should be teacher designed because they prepare the student for the next year, the teacher knows what is being taught, and it gives the student a baseline of what he or she knows.\n \n Summer projects are designed by a teacher that the student will have next year. These projects need to incorporate what will happen in the upcoming year. Many first units include what was included in the summer project. Summer projects help student get ready for the new year by giving students an easy, slow paced, and minimal effort project that will help students in the long run. These projects are often worth points and can boost grades when quarters or semesters are ending.\n \n Teachers know what is being taught for the next year. They can design the assignment to reflect what will happen. Students can't do that. They don't know what is going to be taught or how the teacher teaches. If a student were to design the project, they would make it have little to no relation to the upcoming class. Students during the summer are lazy, I speak from experience, and the last thing they want to do is school work. When they design their own work, it is sloppy; lazy; and unrelatedÂ to the class.\n \n Lastly, the summer project gives an honest and unbiased evaluation of what the student already knows and what they don't know. The assignment is students' first test, and students can give themselves an honest evaluation of themselves. How much did I have to Google? Did I ask my friends for help? How long did it take me? These are all questions that they can ask themselves. These questions and project will show how much work they will need to put in during the school year.\n \n Some might say that students can prepare themselves betterÂ for the school year than the teacher can. They don't need to have the teacher to assign them work. The weakness in that argument is that students are over confident in their abilities on what the know and don't know. As a student in high school, I constantly believe that I am smarter than I truly am. Students will think they know more than they really do and will already be behind before the school year starts.\n \n Teachers design these projects to help and prepare the student. It gives an honest evaluation of students' abilities and knowledge. More teachers should assign summer projects to keep students' brains engaged. This helps them prepare for the next year while also seeing what the teacher wants. The teacher knows the subject better than the student; teachers should assign summer projects not students.Â",

      "Benefits of Student-designed Projects\n \n Summer projects are to keep students learning during summer break but most kids don't find the projects entertaining. Student-designed projects can improve their creativity and make them want to complete the project. Also, teachers will be more excited and looking forward to seeing the outcome of students work. Schools should really think about making more projects student-designed. Summer projects should be student-designed because more students will want to participate, increase creativity, and boost their self-esteem.\n \n In schools, participation from students is very important and student-designed summer projects are a great way to increase excitement and participation. If students could come up with their own projects and enjoy the work that they are doing, plenty of other students will want to do the project. In addition, students will see their peers coming up with their own kind of project and will want to join in by making a project themselves. For example, a student can see one of their friends making a project and can tell that the friend is having fun while doing it. This will encourage the student to join in on the student-designed project and make them want to do the project more. This proves that summer projects should be student-designed.\n \n Secondly, student-designed projects can increase creativity throughout students. Projects already help with creativity but having a student design a project can really increase it. For example, my art teacher had the class come up with different ideas for our next piece of art work. There were so many creative thoughts going around that my teacher had us make our own unique thing. As I worked on the project, I could really see my creative side show and everybody else's too. Having students design their own projects for the summer is really good for the next school year. For instance, students developing and finding out how creative that can be will improve grades and talent. This proves that summer projects should be student-designed.\n \n Self-esteem is an important factor in the real world, having students design a project can help them improve their confidence. A student knowing that they completed a project, they've made, will make them proud of themselves. In addition, using the project in other classes, and getting recognized for designing a good project will drastically increase their self-esteem. Students-design summer projects will increasingly let students know that they can do any thing they put their minds too. Self-confidence will provide students with better outcomes, motivation and even they will feel more confident in the work they are putting out. In this paragraph, I proved that summer projects should be student-designed.\n \n Some opponents believe that teacher-designed projects should be used for summer projects. Also, they may feel as if it will be easy on students and a better way of learning. However, giving students a easy way isn't always the best thing to do. Having students design a project has better outcomes in the long run. For example, having a teacher design a project and give it to students may not help students become more creative or participate or even gain self-esteem from it. So, a teacher-design project for the summer, in my eyes, is not the best thing to have students grow and improve in certain positions.\n \n In conclusion, keeping students active and learning during the summer by having student-design projects has plenty of benefits. In addition, this can have a better impact on students as well as be more exciting and entertaining to students. Three benefits for student-design summer projects are it will make students want to participate, increase creativity, and boost their self-esteem. This proves that summer projects should be student-designed.Â Â",

      "When we think of break, whether it's Spring, Summer or Winter, we tend to think of it as something where we can relax after a long period of work or school, however, during these breaks, many of us play sports, have jobs or preform other activities during this time off. It's important to keep in mind that many students preform various activities when discussing a summer assignment. Some schools offer up this assignments, that way students are able to learn during break. The question isn't whether summer assignments are necessary or not, because having prior knowledge going into a class is important, but rather the question is whether the summer assignments should be be comprised of questions made by teachers or questions made by students. Having questions created by students, will make the summer assignments much more useful.\n \n If you ask any student who pays attention in a certain class about the way they feel about that class, they're sure to give you a wide array of emotions that they felt toward certain topics or units. For example, if you ask a student their thoughts on unit 7, they are able to tell you if it was hard or easy and if it was on the difficult side, they would be able to tell you what kind of questions confused them. having this foresight is very important when creating questions, you are able to give other students more exercises for the questions you think are more difficult.\n \n Another reason why it is more beneficial for students to create summer assignments rather than teachers, is because teachers tend to over prepare students which could become damaging. \"Overprepare\" can mean that you know the bare minimum and more, which does apply to teachers summer assignments, however, knowing too much unnecessary information can make you forget important information. Overcrowding summer assignments with non vital knowledge can also be discouraging to students, and it will make them not want to attempt the work.\n \n Overall, having student created questions will benefit other students taking that class, because, at the end of the day, students understand what it's like to be a student. A student is not just a person who attends a form a schooling but an actual person. Students need time for sports, jobs they may have, or even just socializing and hanging out with friends. Other people who understand these struggles, should be the ones who ultimatley be in control of the questions.",

      "Summer break is the biggest part of the year that students look forward to. Students want to have fun with friends and just relax, however, students are still required to continue learning throughout their break in order to retain information they've learned over the school year. Consequently, students are assigned teacher-designed summer projects. Some people may say that teacher-designed summer projects are effective, however, student-designed projects are better because it would be more enjoyable for the students and it will have more diverse topics.\n \n First of all, having students design their ownÂ projects would be a lot more enjoyable for students because they have the freedom to choose their own topics. For example, the famous filmmaker and entrepreneur Walt Disney was not always successful with his work. At the start of his career he drew little art work pieces for a small local newspaper company, although he wasn't able to profit from his drawings that much, he still loved his job because it was something he wanted and loved to do. It can be seen that people are able to go through tough times if they are able to express themselves freely. Another example would be is when my science class was assigned a group project and students had the freedom to do whatever they wanted to do. My group decided to do it on climate change, which wasn't very appealing to me at the time, but as I learned and dug in deeper into the topic, I found it more and more interesting which led to me being more educated in climate change and gaining new knowledge made it was more memorable. This shows that when students have the freedom to choose and design their own projects; it helps students learn something they never knew about, which leads to students being more educated.\n \n Secondly, letting students design their projects will lead to more diverse topics. Students are always taught to follow a rubric which can be stressful; consequently, students are limited when it comes to expressing their thoughts and opinions. In fact, during my English class, students were split into groups and we were all assigned the same topic to debate about and we were also assigned which side to take on the topic. This lead to students being confused and frustrated because they didn't know what to talk about because they didn't agree with what they were assigned, which lead to the debate being very confusing and vague; students from all groups were stating the same basic reasonings with no interesting details. It can be seen that it's hard to describe or discuss about certain topics when there's no diversity of thoughts. On the other hand, during my history class, the whole class held a debate on a topic where students were given the choice to pick which side they wanted to take. As a result, students from both sides were able to share their thoughts and opinions on the topics, which led to students from bothÂ sides giving diverse, different, and interesting ideas and students were able to learn from each other. Every person is different and everyone has different thoughts that people can learn from one another.\n \n Some say that teacher-designed projects are better because teachers are more experienced and know what's better for the students, however, that reasoning is flawed due to the fact that every student is different and some students need more freedom in education. For example, studies have shown that when students are given work that's confusing or notÂ enjoyable; they procrastinate until the due date and the scores and grades are often lower. However, when students are given the opportunity to choose their own topics and work on what they want to do, they take more responsibility and complete the task on time with a higher score. Teachers being more experienced than students may be true, but giving students a chance and letting them work on their own may show better results. Often times, students are too focused on grades and rubrics, which can be stressful and upsetting when they receive a bad grade for their work they thought was good, however, when students follow their own rules and knowledge it'll be more rewarding when they receive a good grade and it'll be easier for students to find what they lack and need to work on, to improve when they receive a bad grade.\n \n In conclusion, students should have the freedom to choose and design their own summer projects because it'll give the students a chance freely express themselves. Students today have a lot of information thrown at them during the school year and having to retain all that information throughout summer is very difficult, but having students forcefully research and learn about a topic they don't like would be very discouraging and not very effective. Learning is an important part of life, but students should still have the freedom to research and work on something they want to do.Â",

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. A teacher-designed school project is a way to communicate with upcoming students through the introduction of the new curriculum. However, a student-designed project allows students to choose their own topic. The students would have complete control over their summer project, permitting them to prove what they are individually capable of. Summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to explore their own interests, it gives students more freedom to be creative, and is less stressful.\n \n Students should be able to design their own projects so that they can indulge themselves in matters that personally interest them. For example, students would put more effort into a project they are interested in, rather than one assigned to them. Researching topics that are unappealing does not encourage a higher quality outcome in an assignment. The freedom to explore other topics that are more personal and relatable gives students the power to prove they understand their project. Also, students have more freedom in their presentation. They are allowed to represent their knowledge through the projects in whatever form they believe fits best. This way, teachers are able to see work habits and the effort students provide in their project's display. Freedom in choosing their own topics truly allows students to learn about what they desire.\n \n Another reason in favor of student-designed projects is the capability of creativity. A personal project allows students to create their work however they see fitting. Students can design and display their summer's worth of research in their own creative ways. Students creating their own projects freely will provide better, more creative outcomes. In addition, teacher-assigned projects teach kids to follow a rubric and limit their own creativity. Students will put less effort into a project with specific guidelines because they are less interested and feel constrained to the task's specific guidelines. Developing their own projects allows them to be free-thinking, and provide a creative project that accurately represents their efforts. Student-designed projects allow for more creativity than teacher-designed projects.\n \n Finally, student projects are less stressful than a teacher-assigned project. For example, all students creating the same exact project encourages academic competition. Competing to create and develop a better project than friends and peers introduces more stress to students. A summer project should not be used to stress students, for the students will recieve unwanted and false ideas about the stress and workload of school. Also, unwanted stress can cause the students to cheat on or disregard their assignments. The pressure of a teacher-designed project could drive students to copy another students' work. Other students, who are notÂ engaged in a teacher-designed project, might completely blow off the project, and waste their summer unproductively. Stress drives students to make projects more trouble than they are worth.\n \n Student-designed summer projects are clearly a better choice than teacher-designed projects. Students are permitted to research and report on their own interests and what applies to them. Creativity in their projects is derived from the freedom to complete their work in their own way. Student-designed projects take away from the amount of stress added from teacher-assigned projects and their elaborate rubric and grading systems. A student's own project can display one's hardworking capabilities towards a set of academic goals.",

      "Summer projects are something a student always dreads during vacation, maybe your at the pool and you remember that you have to do a research paper for your science class that has to be turned in on the first day of school. So you get ready to work on it but you dont know what to do it on and you get stuck since your supposed to choose the topic and the format your research paper is going to be in. Giving students the opportunity to design there own project is good, but students forget so much during vacations that they have no prior knowldedge or forget how to do certain things. This is why Teacher designed projects during the summer are a better idea then student designed projects. Since students can understandably be too busy enjoying there vacation they can forget how to do certain things or have problems making decisions for there projects. on the other hand if teachers design these projects they can make a rubric on what to include points, topics, and even examples and if any students are confused they can just email the teacher. Ive had experience with a teacher designed project or assignment and it turned out way easier then I thought it would be even when I had difficulties me and my teacher were able to work out a solution so I could finish the project.\n \n Summer vacation for students is a time to relax go travel or visit other family members maybe get ready for a summer sport. Most students wont even think about there work until the last month of vacation when this happens thats when students start to panic. Projects can also be hard if a student goes out of country for the summer and doesnt have acess to technology at all times and struggle to create a project that gets high points. Even if students have acess to technology, during large gaps like summer vacation students can tend to forget many things they learned during the school year since they arent really learning anything. Students are more likely to get a better grade on there projects if they are given certain tasks that they have to do to complete there project so that they dont stress out over the work they have to do.\n \n In comparison Teacher designed projects can be easier to follow since most teachers will leave specific directions that you have to accomplish. This takes away from the stress of coming up with something yourself and sometimes wasting time looking for the right topics. Teacher projects can vary depending on classes like for instance an English might make you read a book then give a report on it and they give you a series of books that you can choose from. Most Teacher projects have a goal or something they want you to accomplish ,so its really clear what they want you to do and how to execute it to get the best grade possible. Reaffirming my statement most teachers will give a rubric or packet to show what you have to do and maybe even examples so you can have a better idea of what they want from you. This method can give students a clear picture of what they need to do and they can plan what work they should complete now and which to do later. Even then students might still be confused so if they really are stuck they can just email the teacher since most teachers will give there email before summer break begins just in case students have questions.\n \n I had a experience with my AP government teacher where before the class had even started he had left us a assignment/project to do. He explained that this project was so we could start the year sprinting and fly through the first couple of units so we could get to the important topics about government. I went travelling to visit my family in Canada and didnt start doing the project until there was a month left. everything seemed pretty easy by itself and everything was clear, but I was supposed to print the the documents after I had finished completing them and I didnt have a printer. I was able to email him to see what I could do and he recomended I just answer the documents in paper and to just hand it to him when school started. i was able to have a nice summer and still do the work and when school came by i was able to give him the work.\n \n Even though teacher designed projects are a bit easier and straight to the point it doesnt give you much option to be creative or do much else. Student projects can be more fun and give a greater sense of purpose since your choosing what your going to do for your project. This gives room to people who are really passionate and creative about theyre topic and they create amazing things. by putting restrictions and limiting the ammount that these people can do it makes them feel less motivated and makes it seem like they are just doing simple work instead of doing something special. this can hurt them and maybe even make them lose interest in the class that they generally like.\n \n In conclusion even though Student projects offer more purpose Teacher designed projects are more simpler and easier to understand so students dont have to stress when they are in vacation. Teachers provide clear directions and can offer help when needed so students can focus on being with there familys and relax. Students can have a rough time doing there projects if they are given vague instructions for doing it and they end up wasting time and not making a good final product. From my experience i was able to complete my work and work through troubles I had with my teacher so I do believe that Summer projects should be Teacher designed.Â",

      "These summer projects should be student designed for sure. It shows which students who are willing to apply themselves and show how creative they are, which would separate them from the rest. This would in return create a bias with the teacher.\n \n If summer projects were designed in such a way where the student led their own idea with what to do with said topic, this would ulimtatly separate students from each other. I refer to this as \"the breaking point\". I refer to it as \"the breaking point\" because it shows which students who are willing to apply themselves, who are trying with mediocre effort or don't care at all. It builds discipline and character. If you are willing enough to take the extra mile and go out of your way to make this project the best ever, then that proves to your teacher that you are the one who wants it, you are the one to ask questions, you are the one to make it. Some students would probably set them selfÂ up for failure and try to find the easy way too workout around said project. All this shows is that they wish to take the wide path that life has set before us and not the narrow path with temptations that build that discipline. This project should be meant for who wants it, not for what its really on. It should basically be an assessmentÂ to see what level of goat they are on.\n \n Now there is a very great con to my argument. That con my friend has a name, and her name is, bias. With going with the plan on doing said project create a very huge bias within teachers. Once they see who was very willing to apply themselves and who wasn't, they'll most likely start to prematurely pick and choose favorites. I say this because they'll start to imagine how well this student will do in their class and how terrible the next would. Come school time, the kids won't know it, but the teacher already has a secret disliking for some of the students. It's to hell with them basically. It's hard for us students to overcome such a bias from a mistake we made. Even if we start acing the teachers class, they'll probably jump to conclusions and assume we have cheated all year or something. This project is a great cause with two possible outcomes: A great upbringing or a terrible downfall. But see, you might have though that I am swaying you away from actual argument but here's where the good comes in. This project brings out the teachers true character as well, we can see if the teacher is really loving as people say they are no matter what, or will their true colors show? This whole thing is one big assessment on everyone's moral values. Are you a fan or a hater?\n \n In conclusion, life is what it is. Bias or not, let the kids show who they are and who THEY want to be. Don't allow teachers to solely let the do what they want but instead let a student explore his mental. Let us breathe and thrive in life. Let us learn from our own mistake and not be carried on the shoulders of someone else. I would like to end this passage with a qoute I made myself.\n \n \"One can only achieve which he belives\"\n \n -Generic_NameÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

Teachers give students summer projects to make sure that we are still learning and not forgetting information that we already know and to keep working the students brain. I agree with teachers assigning students a summer project because it lets the students be creative and learn in a fun way.\n \n I agree that summer projects should be student designed because it will show what the students have learned and it would show what they need to improve on. Students will be learning more because the students would be researching to find information and they would learn new information. Students can learn and be involved with the project and it would raise your grade if it is low. If the student is bored and has nothing to do than they can work on the project.\n \n Also, students can be creative and design the project how they want to do it. Being creative is great because it lets the student show what they got and just have fun with it. Being creative can lead to positive thinking and makes the students feel like they can do it. Students love making projects how they want to and makes them think and brainstorm to see how they will make it look like they gave it all they had. Students love being creative and the students learn while being creative on the project and to show how much potential the students have in them.\n \n Some students find the topic they get for the project interesting and joyable. If students like the topic then they will do more research and learn and have fun with the project. Student designed projects will let the students have fun and research and learn about the topic and let the students explore. Student designed projects will be better for the students and let them show you what they learned and researched about and to let them show how creative they are. Students having teacher designed doesn't let them be creative and let them research and find information and to let them show what they have learned.

      "Summer vacation is a time of rest, relaxation, and recreation for public school students across the nation. However, this break is also well-known for creating significant academic setbacks for these students and causing them to struggle in their return to school. To solve this common issue, many schools have started to require their students to complete a summer project in order to maintain their academics outside of school. Although these projects would be more educationally beneficial for the students if constructed by the teachers, the summer projects should be student-made because the students are more likely to enjoy the project, there is a higher probability of the students completing the project, and the efforts of the students to do a high-quality project are increased.\n \n To begin with, the summer break projects should be constructed by the students because they are more likely to enjoy the project. In today's society, many students enjoy creating things that they thought of themselves and were not assigned by a teacher or parent. Consequently, if these projects were created by teachers, the students would say that the topic that the teachers selected for the project was not interesting enough and would not be as motivated to complete the assignment. If these projects were created by the students, they would not feel forced to do the project. Instead, they would leave for summer vacation already anticipating starting this fun and exciting new activity. In conclusion, schools should allow students to create their own summer project because the students are more likely to enjoy it.\n \n In addition, the allowance of a student-constructed summer project would increase the probability of completion by the students. If the students are permitted to complete a project of their own invention, their motivation to do it will increase because they are guaranteed to enjoy the topic of the project. Teacher-constructed projects are not likely to suit the interests of each of their students. This results in a percentage of the students not enjoying the topic of the project, losing motivation to do what was assigned, and eventually not completing the project at all. This can be avoided if the topic of the summer project was student-selected because each student would be doing something that they are interested in. To conclude, students should be allowed to select their own summer project instead of the teachers selecting it because their motivation to complete the project is guaranteed to increase significantly.\n \n Finally, schools should permit students to pick their own summer project because the chance that students will construct a project of higher quality will increase. Students completing a project that they are interested in are proven to spend more time and effort on their assignment. Forcing students to construct a project that they are not interested in is the easiest way to receive a low-quality project. In order to prevent students from creating an unambitious and lazily-made project, schools should permit students to choose what project they will be doing. This ensures that every student is doing something that they will be guaranteed to enjoy. To summarize, the allowance of student-constructed projects increases the probability that schools will receive high-quality projects on their return.\n \n In conclusion, the summer projects should be student-made because the students are more likely to enjoy the project, there is a higher probability of the students completing the project, and the efforts of the students to complete a high-quality project are increased. The projects mandated by these schools will create a new generation of inquisitive and ambitious students. The students who complete these interactive and enjoyable projects are more probable to enjoy school on their return and have an increase in motivation and ambition regarding their academics. Allowing the students to construct these summer break projects instead of the teachers is the best possible decision that America's schools could ever make for the future generations of today's society.",

      "For many students, summer projects are a useless task forced upon them by their teachers. These assignments can be detrimental to the continuity of the students' learning. Without the freedom to stray from the normal, one may become expectant of nothing more. Student led assignments give highschoolers the opportunity to be creative in their learning, learn responsibility, and prepare them for the future.\n \n During the school year, students are expected to learn through the guidance of the teacher. While some people enjoy this structure, many feel their creativity is being repressed. A survey done on high schools students, asking about how they feel they have the ability to represent themselves through schoolwork, 75% feel that they do not have the option to express themselvesÂ with their current workload. With a self-led summer project students could continue learning through the break, by studying a topic that interestsÂ them which, in turn, inspires them to create a more thought out end result.\n \n Responsibility, a skill hopefully learned by students through school, is not easy to become proficient at. And with many teachers setting deadlines and giving extensions, students can lose responsibility without trial and error. A psychological study that followed five students' grades and work style throughout four years portrayed the effect that self-led projects had on students before they left for college. Teenagers who had no control over their learning, while seemingly successful with their grades, lacked development on the section of the brain that controls creativity and responsibility. However, students who worked with their teachers on their course of study had better developed this section. These skills not only help students grow as self-thinkers, but as responsible and thoughtful human beings.\n \n In many ways, the future for today's children is unlike the life they live now in school. There will no longer be someone to give them instructions for every task, and many projects are completely controlled and monitored by the person creating it. School is designed to prepare students for the real world, yet many findÂ themselves lost by the time they must complete their own study or presentation in college. While it may be difficult to recreate these circumstances in high school, a summer project gives students adequate time to thoroughlyÂ researchÂ and involve themselves in their project. One may find themselves discovering new topics that they were not previously aware of. Whereas without the freedom to follow their own direction, they would become trapped with the same topic and format as everyone else.\n \n Free thinking is an important skill to have once you're an adult, and student-designed projects support the formation of this skill. The opportunity to express themselves through their learning is essential to the development of useful, creative habits that can be extremely helpful for the future of the world.",

      "Summer break, a time for both students and teachers to get a few months away from the not so wonderful place we call school. While most schools allow students a complete break from doing work there are some who still want to continue the learning experience during those months off. These schools require students to do a summer project to ensure they continue learning and don't completely shut off their brains. The question retaining to this topic is, should these projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? My stance on this is, the projects should be student-designed being that this is their break from school and they are still being required to complete a project.\n \n Students need the freedom to choose what they want the project to be about. Even during the school year most projects are teacher-designed, the teacher always has things set up how they want it and all the projects end up looking the same. I personally don't know how many students would complete a full project over the summer anyway, but if they are allowed to design it and set it up themselves I think they will be more excited to complete the task. Students also deserve this freedom, I feel like so many times teachers restrict things or make things more complicated by giving the students no freedom. Also, by allowing students the freedom to design their projects many students will show more respect for their teachers in the future and be more likely to work harder on other other things they are required to do.\n \n Whether students choose to show it in the work they turn in to their teachers, they are all so highly creative. I feel that most students don't tend to show how creative they are because they don't like the assignment they are given or feel like the guidelines are too strict to fully express themselves. I think it's important for teachers to know what their students are capable of and see that they can really bring their best work forward when they allow students to have more control of a project. Creativity is a really great way to understand someone, if teachers allow the students to be creative then they will start putting more of themselves into the projects and teachers can really start to see what wonderful minds they all have. Students need to be able to express themselves in creative ways and one of those ways is by allowing them to design their own project.\n \n My final point I'm going to make is that even though some schools may want to continue the learning experience during the summer it is still the students summer break. The thing most students look forward to from day one of school is summer break and a good majority of those students definitely don't want to have to complete a school related project when they are away from school. But if it's a requirement then allow the the students to choose what their projects will be about. Most teachers don't do work over the summer cause that's their break as well so if students must be forced to complete a task then let them be in charge so they aren't completely miserable their whole summer.\n \n In conclusion, the required summer project that students have to complete should be student-designed. These students work hard for almost ten months and deserve a break without hard, restricted work their teachers assign. But, if it is a requirement they deserve to be in charge of it. They need to be allowed the freedom to create these projects as they see fit. Students are wonderful, creative people and need to be allowed to express themselves thoroughly so that teachers can see what theyÂ are capable of when they let them take the reigns and let their creative magic happen. After all summer break is supposed to be a time for them to relax and forget about school for awhile and they most certainly don't want a complicated project to work on so, I say, the students need to be able to design their own projects for sake of letting them enjoy their summer break.",

      'Teachers can justify students knowledge more accurately than students. Teachers are very experienced compare to the students because they gained so much knowledge in their life. By doing the teacher designed projects, students can learn something that they did notÂ know about. Teachers would know what topics they really need to focus on and what are the most important things they need to know about. Students summer projects should be designed by their teachers to make sure that they are being effective, hardworking andÂ responsible for their work during the break.\n \n Summer projects of the students should be designed by their teachers to make sure that the students are being effective during the summer break. Teachers know the academic ability of their student because they know how the students answers some specific types of questions, they know how the students think and understand. For Example, In my fifth grade there was a math teacher named Generic_Name. Ms. Generic_Name and I spent so much time with each other to discuss my mistakes on a test, She asked me do to test corrections on a paper. I solved all the questions correctly without a time limit, She came to me and said, "I knew you could do it, because I have seen you working very hard these days". Then, I realized that I knew how to solve these problems but I was scaredÂ to complete the test before the timer goes off becauseÂ I did not know I could complete everything. This examples describes that the teachers know our academic ups and downs than ourselves. They also know what we need to learn to succeed in our class, So when they design a project to their students they make sure that the students are going to be effective on their break and learning something new which will help them in their future.\n \n Summer projects of the students should be teacher-designed to make sure that the students are hardworking even during the summer break. Teachers know the capacity of hard work we do in our class, they observe the amount of effort that we put into different things like talking, reading, writing and singing, etc. For example, one of my teacher in 10th grade was really nice to me, she always used to ask me about my hobbies and interests. I had a presentation in her class and I went to ask her for help the day before the presentation because I was preparing for almost a month, I wanted to ask her if I did any mistakesÂ in the slides. After I showed her my slides, she gave me a big hug an said "I know how hard you worked for this presentation, I gave you a hard project to see is you are capable to do it or not. Even thoughÂ you came to United States two months ago, you did a fantastic job". I was very happy to hear her saying that I did good and on the day of my presentation I felt really confident on my work. This example explains how the teacher knew that I worked so hard to do my best. By assigning me a hard project based on my level of understanding, I worked hard to understand and analyze every single detail. That helped me to gain confidence on my self and my level of hard work improved a lot. When teachers design the project they make sure that the students are trying to work hard and they want to see how your working level is improving.\n \n Summer projects of the students should be designed by their teachers to make sure that the students are being responsible for their work during the summer break. when teachers design the project they know how long it is going to take the students to complete the project and how well focusedÂ and responsible a student need to be while doing this project. For example, My history teacher in 10 grade was very strict, she always wanted our whole class to turn in everything that she posted online in one day. After 2-3 months of struggling in her class, everything was going really good till the last day of that academic year. All of my work was completed on time. This example says that even though I worked really hard in the beginning, when it came to the end of the yearÂ I was really happy for being responsible for my own work. By learning how to be responsible from that teacher, helped me a lot in all of my other classes too. Summer projects given by our teachers can make us feel responsible for ourselves, by doing the projectsÂ teach us how to be focused and concentrated to get them done on time. when the students design the project they take it easy becauseÂ most of the students just pick something they already know or they already feel confident on, which will not make them feel responsible.\n \n Teachers are very experienced to know how students think about something, they can understand what students know and what we do not know academically. They always try to teach us how to build our academic skills. They want the students to be in an amazing position, they always want to see the best from us because they know how the student are. Summer projects of the students should be teacher designed to make sure that they are being effective, hardworking andÂ responsible for their work during the break.Â',

      "Generic_Name is given a summer project by her teacher and is annoyed over having to do work over the summer, but once she actually starts the project she realizes it helps her remember material and comes to school feeling more prepared. A teacher gives students a project to do over the summer knowing exactly what the students need in order to continue learning and become prepared for the coming school year. Although receiving work to do over the summer for students may be bothersome, teachers understand the requirements students should meet in order to learn efficiently throughout the summer so that they will not forget important material. Teachers should be designing the summer projects rather than students themselves because they understand what material is needed to learn, they have a broader outlook on what all students can do, and they will provide a more challenging project.\n \n Although a student may argue that students should be the ones designing the summer projects because as a student, students will know what will be good for other students. Being the same age group may help in developing a project that will help other students learn over the summer but consequently that is not the case. Students are all different when it comes to learning techniques and when coming up with a project, it may either be difficult or too easy for other classmates. Work provided by students will vary in results and become unreliable. Teachers know what is needed to learn and therefore give students a summer projects that will be efficient enough to help students during the summer.\n \n In order to be prepared for the coming school year, students will need know what material is necessary to remember. Teachers know exactly what material be taught and need to make sure students do not forget basic information. When coming up with a project for students a English teacher will know which basic information is needed to remember, such as knowing basic vocabulary terms to distinguish while reading, Students will easily forget terms and struggle when coming back to school and needing to restudy these basic terms, it also takes away more time for teachers to teach. Teachers are the ones teaching the material and understand the necessitiesÂ students are gonna need to remember for the upcoming year.\n \n With that, to make sure students actually do learn, it is necessary that students are given a project that will be helpful for the majority. Teachers have the broader outlook on what exactly the majority of students should be learning and will help students learn over the summer that way they will feel more prepared for the coming school year. Teachers will ensure that by looking through test averages, seeing where students did worst and best at and reflect that on the summer project. By looking through what students did best and worst at teacher will provide a helpful project for the summer to make sure students learn in the summer. Students will have the lower hand in this situation because of lack of knowledge towards what other classmates did well and bad on.\n \n Summer projects will only help students learn if the project actually requires students to think and work efficiently. Teachers will be sure students are given a project they cannot just wing and do quickly. Teachers could give ESSAYs or book reports that way students will actually be more hands on and not lack off doing the summer projects. Giving students a more challenging or thinking based summer project will not only prevent laziness but will make the students feel more productive with their summer. The boost of productivity will give more confidence to the students as in something that could be too easy to quickly finish. Teachers understand that more thinking based work or more work will help students learn more efficiently and be more productive. Giving them a simple project or a project that involves little work will only increase the chances of students lacking off and therefore result in nothing being learned.\n \n In conclusion, summer projects are given to students so that they continue to learn in the summer and become more prepared for the coming school year. Whether or not these summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed, it is easier to say they should be teacher-designed. Teachers understand the material and the students and therefore will provide a more efficient summer project. When being able to understand what is required for a summer project, teachers will have the better understanding on ensuring the project will be efficient for students to learn.Â",

      "How would a student feel if they had to endure a lesson during the summer by a immature kid? Summer assignments have been implicated in student's daily lives since 7th grade. The theory is that if teachers provide students with a summer assignment, they will be ready for the classroom in the fall. However, there is a rise in the education department where they have to see if it is really benifical for the younger generation to have their assignments designed by a teacher or a student. The pratical answer for this discussion would be to have a teacher-designed summer assignment because it will prepare the students for their class, strengthn their abilities, and open their eyes to what the future would look like going into higher education.\n \n Learning the material by someone who is already trained in this profession will help prepare the students for the year since the teacher is the one who is going to help them get a wide range of education. It will be more benifical if the students learn this way because its going to get them ready for the year. For example, if a math teacher gives a student a summer project that they designed they will already have a planned idea of what is going to be in the next school year. This will let the young adults see what they will be doing in the following school year which in turn can help the student understand if this class is the right clas for them.\n \n Not to mention, if the summer assignments were teacher-designed it will give the students the oppurtunity to learn more about their strengths and weaknesses. In the school system more than 85% of the school's population have struggled in one or two subjects. Moreover, that means students will have a harder time grasping certain subjects when the school year begins. If the assignments where created by the teacher then they will have an easier time at the beginning of the year to understand what the student is struggling with. Moreover, it could also help the student by getting the student to think more about what they struggle with and how they can grow upon it since it is an independent project.\n \n However, since it is a summer assignment, students would not be as motivated to do the work since it is an extended amount of time ot do a minimal activity. As teens go into summer they do not worry about the summer assignment and get this feeling of procrastination with the certain activity. 95% of teens around the world struggle with this thought and wait until the last minute. Which could be damaging to the students education.\n \n Since procrastionation occurs it would be more likely for students to cheat. However, making the assignment teacher designed and giving it time stamps of when it is due during the summer will force students to deal with time managment. Moreover, if we allow our children to be interactive with teacher-designed assignments, then they will be more prepared for the future. For example, if an english teacher decides to make a summer assignment and put certain due dates during the summer rather then giving them a student-designed activity; It will give the student a chance to learn about what it means to have responsibilities. Which is important because it will make sure that students can be independent with their jobs.\n \n The debate on whether or not summer assignments should be designed by a certain person has shown the community what really is important in this society. Our educators wanna make sure that the students will be prepared for what is coming to them, especially if they are taking an AP course. Moreover, it will shine light to some of the weaknesses in a student early on so the educator can help them with this skill. Likewise, it can also make the young adults open to ideas of having important responsiblities so they will be ready for the workforce. No matter what occurs in life, educators should make sure that they are guiding the new generation to a bright and happy future.Â",

It is also important for the teacher to have it planned because they would have all the work needed on the project.\n \n When the teachers plans it out it would be more organized. It is also better for the teacher to have it planned; because they can see where the students need help when they have completed the project.\n \n Teachers would know what information is needed to help the student learn ,and get them ready for the upcoming year. When the teacher has all the work needed on the project; the student wont have to worry and look upÂ what they need to study. This is important because it gives the teachers the information to see what their students are struggling in ,and plan ahead for the year. When the information is laid out for the student it would be more: organized to do their work, more efficient, and gives them a heads up to see what their struggling in. This will also be easier on the teacher when they have the project ready for the students because it gives them an idea how to gradeÂ the project.\n \n The summer projects would be best if the teachers design them. Thats because when students are on break; they would get to lazy and not even want to start making a project for school. Also the student might even forget to design it on their own. Thats why when the teacher has it already designed; they can email their students, and remind them to work on the project that is already made for them. Another reason why the teacher should design the projects is, it gives the students time to be kids and have fun. Also it gives the students more time to enjoy their break with their family and friends.

Most students like to travel over the break and sometimes they can't do it abroad and don't have much time when they come back. For example: \"I went to El Salvador with my father and he lives in the country side, in his house he doesn't have wifi but does have cable. Coming back I only had five days to do it before I had to go back to middle school.\" Students wouldn't be able to do any school work because they could probably not have internet access and want to enjoy their time visiting.\n \n Students can design their project and making it easier by doing: a summary over a couple of simple novels, do a short ESSAY over a easy and simple prompt, do research over patterns in nature like, looking at moon patterns for two weeks or observe temperatures for a period amount of time and do a study on it when they come back. For example: \" I had a simple project to recorded what the moon looked like at night, every night for a week and draw it. This was easy and simple for me to do and i still learned a lot from it from observing that the moon slowly phases through each night through its cycle.\" Even doing small simple projects, students can still learn and discover new things because they don't have to stress about it and its something most students should be able to do.\n \n Someone might say, Teachers select projects that they think is good for students and it's better for a teacher to have control over it because they know their students best, expects them to do their best, accomplish it and that challenging them is good so they don't forget what they learned; however, that's not the case, really what teachers don't know sometimes, and what makes students have a hard time or take a long time on projects is that, teachers want to assign projects to what they think their students can do and put them at a challenging level or a process that takes a long time but students want to have it simple over the summer has they don't have class with other students and don't meet their teachers anymore so they can't ask for help. Students don't need to stress out over the summer by what their teachers assign, letting students decide lets them be creative and discover with what they chose to do.\n \n In conclusion, Student-designed projects, will encourage and help students with work and still learn from it as the teacher wanted for them to learn in the students own creative way.",

      "Is not three months of summer break a very long time to stay away from school work? The summer break is very discussed by people because for some, it is a very long period were people can relax and take a break from the school season. Some students prefer to plan an own program to refresh some topics and other prefer to have a program designated by the teachers. Altrought complete summer projects designed by the teachers for a school purpose during the summer break could dissappoint a lot of students, the teachers know which topic the students have to focus on, and be ready to go back in school as better as possible, for the next school year.\n \n Having a big vision of the development that the student did during the year, the teachers are the best individuals to assign project to work on and refresh on what has been done.\n \n In this case, student have a complete plan to work on and view where they have problems or concerns and be able to get feedback from the teachers. They do not have to spend time in researching in which topics they want to focus, havind a designed plan that cover most of them. Doing the entire work assigated, students could get more confidence and be prepared for the next year. Baing more prepared for the next year, they could take advanced classes and get more credits from it.\n \n The students who complete the entire practice could get a grade for the project itself and another one for the partecipation. This poiunt could could involve students in be active during the summer doing the project designated by the teachers reciving feedbacks and a starter grade for the next year. The teacher giving assignated projects could even give some prequerisits for the units that they are going to go over and do not lose time on them during the beginning of the year.\n \n Complete assigments and project during the school break is the best way to restart the next school year. Infact it could prevent a lot of time that usually is spent on reviewing the previous school program. The teachers are the people that most know about wath the students are going to study the following year, so they can designed the right assignement to focus on during the break.",

I feel as it should be teacher designed because some people wouldn't know what to come with, It would make it easier because they are more familiar to teacher designed assignments, and most students wouldnt do it because its not teacher designed.\n \n First, most students would feel as it's easier because it's teacher designed and thats what they are familiar to. For example, The teacher gave us students designed projects and we really didn't know what to do. So when the time came for us to turn it in, the class really didn't get a good grade.\n \n Another reason, is some people wouldn't know what to come with. In this movie i've watched the teacher had assigned projects to certain groups and this one group couldn't think of anything. So they went to each others houses and would think about what they should do and before they knew it, it was time for the project to be turned in. The next day had came and the teacher put in the grades they all had zeroes. It could have benefits though because assigning students designed projects it can help them later on in life, they could get a job where they have to do the designing.\n \n Finally, most students wouldn't do it because it wasn't teacher designed and they were being lazy. Since they had to do more work they would be lazy and wouldn't do it. I know other students and including myself, that didn't do an assignment because it wasn't teacher designed and we had to do more work and think more. So most of got zeroes.\n \n Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure the continue learning during the break. Should the assignments be student designed or teacher designed.

      "In many schools today, teachers assigning school projects over the summer for students to complete has become quite apparent. Teacher are doing this to have students stay focused even during the summer. Teachers can give one of two assignments; either a teacher specific assignment where every student has to complete roughly the same project with roughly theÂ same outcome that has very little room for variation, or they assign a student ran assignment that allows the student to do a project in something they have interest for and it can be quite personalized. Teacher projects usually are stricter in there guidelines and make the student typically work harder even if the student may not want to do that much work while student driven projects can have many students work extremely hard on something they have passion for. The only problem is you will usually have a slacker in student designed project that will always do the minimum. I see student projects to have better benefits for students as for those that want and enjoy putting in the work for something they are really interested in they will see more accomplishment out of that. Others may that teacher designed projects are better because they force ever student to work but they are wrong because the drive for success should come from the student not the teacher. Summer student designed projects are better for the student that teacher designed projects because it allows for students to take part in the design process and then execute a product of something that a studentÂ is generally interested in.\n \n Summer projects or studying in the summer will always be super beneficial for your education. It allows for you to stay alert and prepared for the next school year. Just studying in the summer alone can make getting into the next year that much easier. Summer projects can be really beneficial to students. In some cases it can allow students to have more a variety in options for there project than doing one in the school year. For example; a teacher assigns an entire class to do a research project on a single type of invasive plant species prevalent in his/her state and they will have to present that in class at the beginning of the year. I take issue with this because it is quite restrictive on what the student can research as its limited to only one plant you can do, and many students will likely pick the same plant. Plus the students have very little do in terms of the creative process in how they want to gather data. If I were the teacher I would have given a project on invasives in the state(allowing for multiple plants to be studied.)and not limit it to just a research project. This allows for a students to really to be flexible and learn more. Students can now have the opportunity to organize community events for conservation. Students can make test plots at a park to see what removal method works best. Students can now study multiple plants at once to compare and create statistics and find out which are the most deadly and hard to remove. Students also have the choice to help with college students on finding new ways of removing said plant from our area and eventually at the state level. Students can also go really indÂ depth into a plant they find super interesting and they can find the true science as to why they continue to grow so fast. The possibilities are endless.\n \n They best part is when it comes down to the presentation. It is very likely that majority of students will have different projects; some may have similar ones but very different findings so its really interesting to see a students, growth, trial, and success through the process of completing the project. While also talking about their final conclusion they should also discuss about how they changed in grew as a person and about what skills they earned that they can use later in their life. Students can truly learn new concepts off of other students. If students were tasked with completing the teacher created project, the majority of students would really not have learned as much from each other.\n \n This was only an example. The possibilities for student lead/created projects are endless because in comes from the student. The example mentioned was limited to conservation but there are student projects have to be. There are projects that can allow students to really branch out and potentially inspire them to their future careers. Students designed projects give students the chance to be a leader and be of something meaningfulÂ to them personally. Anyone can complete a project when it comes from a teacher but if it comes from student it can really create growth. These students will have plenty of time to complete their project as the have an entire summer to do so. The summer should not be a stressful time but it shouldnt be a time slack off and not grow in your learning. Everyday we are learning. Maybe its time for you to help someone else learning. Student designed projects give students the chance to prepare themselves for future challenges in the adult world. Others say that student designed projects dont push students enough to really create a product worthwhile; they are wrong because if a student truly care they will go above and beyond to see the it is completed full to the best of their ability.

      "Some schools require summer projects for students; these projects need to be student designed. When teachers plan a project some students don't enjoy completing the assigned task. For students to learn they have to be interested in what they are doing. There are many ways to assign a school project, it could be hands on, writing, individually, in groups etc. Each student has different skills, they should do a project that best fits that skill to succeed. Summer projects need to be student designed so that they are more motivated to complete the assignment, to have fun with the assignment and to have interest in the task.\n \n Summer projects need to be student designed to enhance motivation. When students are motivated this encodes the topic in their memory. When students are motivated they get better grades, the project is better quality and students do the project to their best ability. As a student when a project gets assigned and I am not interested in the assignment I try to get it done as quickly as possible and put no effort into it. I end up getting a lower grade. Students will also want to keep working on the project if they are motivated to complete it. With more time spent on the project this equals better quality and higher grades. Students won't procrastinate if the project interests them and will be motivated to start the project early. As a student in High School lots of students procrastinate when given a project. If projects were student designed this would motivate them to learn about the topic.\n \n Summer projects need to be student designed so that they have fun with it. If they had fun with the assignment then they would have a memory of their experience. If schools made learning fun they are more likely to remember the topic of the project. If students were in a group for the project this would enhance team work skills if they had fun. As a student I found out that if I had fun learning about a certain topic I remember it more clearly and can connect it to other things in life.\n \n Summer projects need to be student designed to have students have interest in the topic. This would help students explore their interests that they never knew they were interested in. This may help students what they want to do after graduation. Chances are if a student is really interested in what they learned in class then they might explore that topic outside of school. When I had a project assigned to me that I was interested in I enjoyed completing the project and continued to learn more about it outside of school. Summer projects that have students interested is a key to success in their academic career.\n \n In conclusion, summer projects need to be student designed so that they look forward to working on the assignment, enjoy completing the task and continue learning about the topic outside of school. Some people say that projects should be teacher designed they are wrong because students then dont get the freedom of doing what they enjoy most. It also isn't equal to all students. For example, a teacher assigns a research paper on a certain topic, some students have a love for writing and it is their strength and others don't like to write. This is why student designed projects are important.Â",

While some would prefer a teacher designed project, student designed projects lets students chose their own topic, experiment the way they want, and present it the way they want.\n \n Student designed projects lets students chose any topic they want. I love it when I get to chose my own project because I can research any of my desired intrests. Chosing my own topic also motivates me to get the project done; for that, I am a curious person. Any project should let students chose their own topic.\n \n Students should experiment any way they want. When I was a freshman in highschool my science teacher let experiment any way we wanted; I built a solar panal that followed the sun. That project let me have lots of fun and made me be crative. Student designed projects lets students expeiment in thier own way and have fun when their doing it.\n \n Presentations should be apeling and informative to the reader. When I design a project I like to make the project the most crative and informative. Most teaches just say to make a power point or an ESSAY, but that doesn't show any crativity. Student designed projects lets students present how they want to present and let them be as crative as thay want.\n \n Some might like teacher designed projects because students do not have to think of a project; however, student designed projects let students chose thier topic, experiment however way they want, and present the way they want. Summer project should be fun and crative because it is student's break from school. Most student projects are fun, crative, and gives students freedom.",

      "AlthoughÂ many teachers designing their own summer projects for the students, the students should be designingÂ their own summer projects. Students they chose their own topic and design their own project willÂ be more interested in what they are learning. Also the students would be more likely to actually do the project if it is something they have interest in, and the students would have more say in what they are learning if they got to design their own summer project.\n \n If students were allowed to design their own project they would be a lotÂ more likely to actually do the project. Most students rather be with friends or on vacation during summer, rather then staying inside and working on a paper for school in two months. If the student designed the project it would be something that they might actually want to do or find interesting, not just something they were told they had to do the last day of school for that year. I know when I'm on vacation I like to do what I want to do and not be followed around by all the school I have to get done. So if it feels less like school work and more like a project that you want to do in your free time the students might actually do it.\n \n Letting the student have a say in the design of their project helps them get more involved with their learning and education. If you just et a teacher tell them what to do they will get bored with learning and not be interested and learning new things, but if they got a say in them project they could get involved and actually enjoy learning. I know from my life experiences I hadÂ a lotÂ more fun learning when I had a say in what I got to learn, such as me joining the Fire Department. When I joined it was a lotÂ of self assigning tasks and learning on your own time and at your own pace. When I got the chance to work with the people that where teaching me and have a say in what I learned and when I got a lot more into what I was learning and applied myself a lot more then I usually do in school.\n \n A student is way ore likely to do a project that actually interests him or her. A teacher can just pick a random topic without even thinking if the students will find it interesting. If the student is not interestedÂ in the topic it just makes it that much harder for them to pay attention and stay focused on the topic. When you are forced to learn about something that doesn'tÂ interest you it is harder to learn that topic. You have to do it all the time in schools such SOL's. You learn about something in school that does not interest you so the state will give you a label of smart or not smart even if you are just not interested in the random topics they pick to say they have taught you something. If it is a project that is to be done over summer vacation, let it be something that the student might actually enjoy and want to do. The student can easily just blow of the project and then start the next year in a bad spot because he or she is already behind on the first day of school and that is setting them up for failure for the rest of the year.\n \n Although teachers liking to design their summer projects for the students, the students should design their summer project. Have the project follows certain guide lines so it is still some what attached to what the students learned in school. Having the students get involved with their education is good for a lot more than just school, it can help them in the real world too. Students would learn more about something that might interest them if the student designsÂ their own project.Â",

Teachers should be the project designer because teachers can list all the wed-sites and information you need to complete the project. Students wouldn't have the right tools to be a project designer.

      "Over the summer, the majority of students will forget the core lessons they learned; therefore, some teachers decide to give students summer projects to keep information fresh in their minds. There is an ongoing debate over whether teachers should choose the summer projects for students, or if the assignment should be the ideas of the student themselves. There are those that say that it would be better for teachers to assign their own project, but this is not true. Although some may disagree, students should design their own summer projects.\n \n There are a variety of reason why students should create their own summer project. First and foremost, it inspires creativity. When a teacher assigns their own cut-and-paste project, this removes most creativity from the assignment. Students need to practice creative skills, and the low stress environment of summer is a perfect time for doing that. Additionally, students having their own project idea allows them to do what they want to do. This is obviously beneficial because the student can choose the subject that they are best at, which will improve the quality of the summer project. Also, giving the student the choice on what they want to do makes the project enjoyable, which is important considering that it is summer break. Finally, allowing students to assign their own project ideas motivates the student to actually do it. It is very common to witness teachers giving direct instructions on how the class should do something in a certain way, only for the students to lose interest. On the other hand, giving students their own unique project can inspire them to complete it with actual effort.\n \n There are additional reason why students should create their own summer projects. For instance, the student can use real world examples that they are familiar and can easily understand. Most teachers, especially ones in larger schools, will not know the student's personal interests and experience very well. Students can take inspiration, data, and ideas from their surroundings during the summer, which can make for an excellent project. Another reason students should design their own summer projects is that it creates less stress for the teacher. If students are making their own projects, it will make the job of teachers easier since they dont have to create unique prompts for each student. Additionally, each student having their own personally crafted project will get rid of the possibility of cheating, something they have would have if students were all to have the same assignment. Lastly, students creating their own summer projects will prepare them for the future. In college, many assignments given by your professor will be self directed, meaning you will need practice in creating your own ideas for projects. Careers also rely on creativity, innovations need to be made for more efficient work, which can earn you promotions.\n \n Although some may disagree, students should design their own summer projects. This is the case due to less overall stress, motivation for students, and inspiration for creativity and innovation. There are those that say teachers should design the project for the student because the teacher knows what the student needs to learn, what the school board wants, and what the student will learn the following year, but this is not the case. It's true teachers need to encourage creativity in and outside the classroom, but students also should enjoy their summer break after a hard school year.Â",

      "Summer assignments are important to help students continue learning over the summer. This is why these assignments should be designed by teachers, rather than students. This is due to the fact that teachers are going to assign challenging projects, which most students would not; additionally, teachers may use this assignment as a way to prepare the students for the following year.\n \n Everyone wants to enjoy their summer break, go on vacations, and chill at the beach. Summer assignments are a great way to put a pause on the fun. Knowing this, students are not going to purposefully give themselves a challenging project that could benefit them in the long run. They would create assignments requiring the least amount of effort and time in order to get back to playing videogames or tanning on the beach. This defeats the purpose of the summer assignment because an easy project that does not challenge you will not continue your learning throughout the summer.\n \n Additionally, this may be a great opportunity for teachers to help prepare students for the type of assignments they will be recieving the following school year. Students are unaware of what to expect, so they cannot prepare themselves adequately. Teachers have also been with these same students all year and know what they are good at, and what they need to work on. Assigning them a summer project may help these students work on their weak points, and gives them plenty of time to improve before the next school year.\n \n Some may argue that if students are not actively trying to challenge themselves, then they are only hurting themselves. However, many students likely are not sure what type of project would benefit them best, or are unaware of what they need to work on to improve. They also likely assume that they do not need to be challenged or believe that they are already prepared for the next school year.\n \n Overall, students would benefit more from teacher-designed summer assignments. Teachers know what students need to be prepared for and where their weak spots are. Often times students are unaware of how to help themselves improve.

The teachers already gives us alot of assgiments that are dessigned by teachers and their department maybe for once its time to give us a chance to let the projects be on us and up to our knowledge , even though the summer is really suppose to be about our summer vacation because we did just come from school and finished our requirements, the summer is really just a break for student to relax and getting your mind off school but I do agree that we should still do work and try to at least read once in a while so we dont go back to school during end of August or Septmeber and we clueless, reasons of why the summer projects should be student designed is because students may have ideas that teacher dont think about giving and belelive it or not these students can be very creative sometimes and come up with really excting ideas for projects with that being said they should be school educational wise , with the purpose of the summer projects being designed by students it's a better way of showing the teachers and the school education department that we have been learning in school what we need to know for an example when a student is doing their assignment and they include , context clue , details , strong vocabulary words and the unit basis of what we have learned in school. Coming to the next grade level it will show teachers that so far we have learned the right curriculum and the reached the standards because it will be presented in that presentation or that project assignment by the students who are doing it on their summer vacation however , if it were to be teacher designed because teachers are looking for specific portions of what they have learned during out the school year and on books they have read then I would understand why it would be that way even thought its taking out the purpose of a students own ability to do work on what they want to work on like me being in that position I would absolute take student designing the summmer projects for an answer.\n \n I would brianstorm with all my ideas for example ; the way i used math this summer when i went out and helped my father at his job because his back was injured i can definetly write out how i used some math learining skills and I can also write out the trips i went to and wrote ESSAYs about how it went and the stops we made thats a skill of writing and perhaps even reading , the more vacations and trips the longer my ESSAYs can be , of course it has to be educational wise so i will add some puncuations and maybe even the vocabulary that i learned during english class , it will show that not only do i remember what i was doing in school but I will also be preparing myself for next year I will have more practice and knowledge and try to fit in a litte bit of history in there as well like what's going on with my family and the government and how my grandma is sick so we trying to bring her here to stay with us for a while but because of the new rules in the United States , there's just some things we aren't allowed to accomplish no matter how bad we want her here and take care of her , I can definently make a project in how the government has these new rules that affects others and their familes like mine , that would be a example of me being in the postion as to it being student designed so I can personally write about how my life is going with that being said I would have to make the projects relate to school and the things we learned and of course that can be easy because there's alot of things we learn in school that can help us out later in life and when we look at a situation we see the things we been taught to prepare us in becoming adults I still til this day come home telling my parents something new that I've learned and at least try to help like when my mother lost her job and I was sitting in econ and finance and listening to my teacher tell us the things we can come off of when your in a situation like my mother when she was fired and was on a contract but because the business was low my mom was took out , teachers teach you alot about life and how you want to be ready and some students take it as a joke and others think into it and see a lot of sitiations like it when they come home and their parents having their own problems those are things we learn in school and when we have a chance to decide on our ideas. I think it's best as coming up with good thoughts on how around the places you travel or even in your own household there is school knowledge.\n \n things we learn in school students can relate to and may or may not affect them at home . When we're out of school we go home and have a long summer break and as we start to think of the things we've been taught in school we living in it and that's our future , that being said I do think students should be giving the opportuinty to decide on what they want to present there project on in the condtions of it being school educational purposes and to show how they not forgetting what students learning in school. A project in the summer especially when it's our free time, our vacation, it's time to let us students show the teachers what we know and learned from them and how we can relate to it when we are actually living in it, when we learn in school we have all this knowlege and the standards in each subject we're being taught gettting us ready when we become adults ourself. letting it be teacher-designed will only cover what a teacher expects from us.

Students would have a chance to gain responsibility, be creative and make an easy grade.\n \n Firstly, giving students the lead way to design their project allows the individual to gain responsibility. The student would be obligated to make time for all the steps leading up to the final project, making them move their schedule around or cancel plans. This ties into being an adult, making sacrifices to get important things done. For example, a students gets a summer project, its a Friday night and his or her friends wants them to go out. Instead of being behind on the project from going out, simply saying no and staying in to miss out on the fun is a sacrifice to the student. Therefore, creating responsibility from the ultimatum.\n \n Secondly, letting students take lead way is the best option because it allows the student to actually be creative. Students get boring topics and assignments all the time, causing them to do poorly strictly because they dont find interest on the topic. However, giving students the free will design the project based on their interests while also being school related will definitely give a change in the result of the final project versus a random teacher designed project. For example, a teacher gives a random topic she designed to the student. The student gets a topic about plants, which the student knows nothing about while also having little to none interest about them. As a result, the student is not going to give their full potential on the project because they did not have interest on the forced topic.\n \n Lastly, letting students design their summer project will give students the ability to bring their grade up. By students being creative and going the extra mile to have a successful project will give them the the perfect opportunity to make a great grade. For example, while doing the summer project the students will have confidence in the topic. While doing research the student will know exactly what they want to look for and even have a small plan on how they'd like the final outcome of the project to be. Resulting in a confident, well putÂ together project.\n \n However, some teachers might argue that allowing the students to design their summer project wouldn't be an excellent idea. Teachers may say that students would give no effort because they do have lead way on their project or it may be overwhelming for the student to make a decision on what they wanted their topic to be. However, letting the student have the option to choose their topic would not allow the student to not give effort or any creativeness. The topic would only be designed by the student and what their personal skill level is, leaving them to set their own boundaries up based on what they prefer.\n \n In result, when summer rolls around and summer projects are assigned, letting students get the opportunity to design their project gives them responsibility by making simple or grand decisions, an open door to the students creative limits, and also makes great pay off from all the hard work and dedication gone into the project. So next time a teacher assigns a boring topic, students should take the lead and make a astonishing grade.",

      "Most schools require students to complete a summer project to make sure that students are still expanding their knowledge while school is closed. These summer projects are long, uninteresting, and tiring. Most students refuse to complete a summer project. Summer projects should be made into something that students would want to do and enjoy doing. Summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to be creative, students can pick an assignment that is best for their knowledge capability, and students become more intrigued with their assignment.\n \n Typically when summer projects are assigned from a teacher, they're similar assignments. When summer projects are similar, they attend to make all students the same and strips away any originality. Students need to be able to show their individuality through their work. Research shows that when students choose their assignments, they exceedÂ by forty-five percent more than a teacher-assigned assignment. Creativeness is something that should be essential to students because that it was forms them as a whole and makes them unique to themselves. Each summer project would allow students to express themselves in ways that a teacher-assigned summer project can't. Creativity is something that is with-in a person and something that should never be taken away from an individual.\n \n Students come in variety, from ethnicity, gender, age, and most importantly in this case, teaching perforations. Students will learn a lot better if they were allowed to pick their own assignments because they could create a summer project that is perfect for their learning pace. For example, I observed that when I am completing an assignment that is not too fast or not too slow for me, I do better tremendously. Summer projects are so horrific already, at the very least students should be able to decide what is best for their learning capacity. Pacing would set students up for great improvement and succession.\n \n Students will become more interested in their summer project. Most students will not complete or do well on something that they are not interested in. An article stated that, because students are so young, and their brain has not developed yet, their attention span is very short. Meaning that students will not focus on anything for a very long time, especially something that is boring and has no significance to them. Evidence also shows that each year the passing rate and or completion rate of summer projects never exceed or increase, the rates always decrease. Students will be intrigued with their work if its assigned by them. If teachers keep assigning summer projects then the passing rate of the summer projects will continue to decrease, students need to stay interested and the most important way to have that happen is to allow them to choose their own summer project assignment.\n \n Summer projects need to cater to students to cause improvement. Students do not require much to be successful,teachers just have to have the ability to allow their students to be flexible with their work. It is important that teachers grasp knowledge of how important it is that a student remains creative,that a student can pace themselves,that students remain intrigued, and most importantly students become successful with their summer projects. Summer projects are a wonderful idea but being student-assigned is way better.",

      "When school ends, and summer break begins, some schools require students to complete summer projects. These projects are to make sure students continue their education outside of school. When teachers design the projects, students are more challenged with the work they are given. However, a student-designed project is a much better choice; Students are more likely to do the work designed by them, students will have less of a hard time, and students will feel less stressed rather than having to do a more challenging project.\n \n A project designed by a teacher can be dreadful enough, let alone the fact that the project is over break. Student-designed projects are more likely to be completed due to the simple fact that the work would be more enjoyable for students. When a student gets work that they are able to enjoy, they will complete it. Most teachers do not give out work that a student could enjoy, they just give out boring work. Some students enjoy the work when there are more interactive activities within the project, and some students do not get much done when it is just the work itself.\n \n When students enjoy the work, that means they are not having a hard time understanding and completing what needs to be done. Students feel good and more confident in the work they do when they understand what they are doing. If a student has a hard time comprehending what is being taught, they tend to become indecisive and would choose to not turn their work in. Student can be nervous at times, like when they want to ask for help. Most students just try to either figure out work themselves or just not do the work. Making the projects student-designed can help students be more confident when it is on work they do not have a hard time on. Students work better on work they are confident on, and on work they know they are capable in doing.\n \n School can stress a lot of children out. Making them continue doing work can add on to their stress if it is something they feel incapable of doing. Giving students the choice of designing their project can give them the benefit of the doubt, because the project is still what the school wants but just at the rate of what the student can do. Stress should not be something a school wants their students to have.\n \n Summer break is the time for students to enjoy themselves. Students should at leastÂ have the choice on how their project is designed. All year the teachers had a say on what their work would consist of. The students should have a project they could enjoy doing, and not feel forced to do a project they would have a hard time on. If they have to have a project it should be something they do not stress over, but something they are confident in doing. Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â  Â Â Â",

      "Throughout my adolescent past, I've had a vigorous number of summer assignments. Whether it was a Algebra 1 packet or a summer reading assignment, teachers never fail to overwhelm there students with work before the year even begins. Most summer assignmentsÂ are enforced by the teachers and lack any student input. A majority of students show little interest in the assignments they are presented and approach the work with a negative attitude rather than optimism. Although a student-designed summer project is a chance for students to exhibit there work in a more enjoyable fashion, a teacher-designed project would work better because teachers understand what work will best prepare students and shows the type of projects teachers will assign in the future.\n \n A reason why teachers should design the projects is because they understand what work will best prepare students. Many teachers have attained an advanced education in there subject. Unlike the students, the teacher knows exactly what the course will consist of, and the level of difficulty that they will cover. In most classes, students start the year with no prior knowledge of the subject they will cover. An example of there unpreparedness is that large portions of high school students switch out of classes because they don't know the level of the work that they will be covering.Â A student led project could be void of any important information. If they find an area of the subject thats more difficult than the others, they could address that area more than another part of the subject.Â Assignments created by teachers would be a prime opportunity for teachers to demonstrate the work they will cover, and help a student drop the class if the work seems too challenging. A summer assignment is before the year starts, so switching your classes wouldn't interrupt your school year.\n \n Another reason teachers should design the projects is because it shows what type of assignments will follow in the future. Teachers are a people of habit. Throughout the year, they will assign projects that are very similar to each other, following similar guidelines. An example of repetition in school is teachers assigning a variation of slide show presentations. Throughout the school year, many teachers conduct slide show presentations within new concepts. If a student were to design the summer project, it could be an entirely different format then any format suggested by a teacher. With the teacher in control, they could give you a project very similar to one that you may face in the future.\n \n Many believe that if enjoy what your doing, than you will be more productive. A student getting to choose what type of project they will do could introduce the topic in more exciting manner. While enjoying what you do is important, it may also not prepare a student to the best of it's capabilities. A student led project may not cover the ground that it needs to cover. For example, the students could decide to write a one paragraph reflection on an area of the subject that they found interesting. The problem with that format is that it may only tackle a small portion of the subject, and you wouldn't be able to reflect on what others found interesting, which would help you remember the information better.\n \n The teachers should design the project that the students work on. They know what work will best to prepare students and help them succeed. Teachers understand the subject far greater than any student designing the project. A more rigorous area of the subject could be addressed more in the project. If the teacher creates all of the future projects, than the summer project could reflect the type of projects teachers will assign in the future. Repetition is prominent within classrooms, and a summer assignment created by the teacher could offer incite into future projects. With a student in control of the project, they may only address a small area of the subject that will come up later in the year. While a student-designed summer project can make there work more enjoyable, a teacher-designed project would be better for students, because teachers understand what will prepare them best and is a way to discover the type of projects teachers will assign in the future.Â  Â",

      "Should students really be making the summer projects? Students making the summer projects would help the students focus more on the project, help make the project less stressful, and could figure out a way to involve their family.\n \n If a student designes a project they are going to make sure it interests them. They aren't going to make it something they dont want to do. Some might say the students aren't going to know what information to learn and use in the project. If teachers work with students they can figure out a way to make sure that they students learn all the information they need to. Teachers can even give them a rubric with all the information the students need to use.\n \n When you are doing something that you enjoy you stress about it less. Especially when you're on summer vacation doing a summer project is the last thing that you want to be doing. Kids would much rather hang out with friends or play video games. If students are designing the projects they will design something that is less time consuming or more easy to manage . While some agree with this others are concered that students would make the project too easy. Teachers at the end of the day are assigning the project, they can put guidelines and expectations on top of the students project design.\n \n During summer vacation lots of students will travel and go places with family. Students can figure out a way to involve family members making the project easier to do on the road. Having a parent help out on a project helps out and helps kids stress less. While doing a project with family members might distract students from learning some say doing a project with parents might help kids focus as well. No kid wants to mess around during a project with their parents.\n \n In conclusion, there are many benefits to allowing the students to design their own project. If students were to be allowed to design their own summer projects it would help students focus more on the project, it wouldn't be a super stressful project and students could involve their family.Â",

Students should have a oppertunity to pick their own summer projects because it allows them to be more creative. It will give students less of a chance to cheat off each other. It will also help the teachers know more about their students, what they struggle with and what they understand.\n \n Students can be more creative and willing to do the project if they get to design it themselves. If its about something that is special to them they will put more effort into doing it. Most of the summer projects I got I didnt do because it didn't interest me at all. In English, they usually give out a summer reading list of books they want you to read. I would try to read the books that were on the list but they never made me want to finish it. If I had the oppertunity to pick my own books then I would read all summer.\n \n Letting students pick there own project would keep kids from cheating because if they have to pick their own topic then two kids can't write about the same thing the exact same way. Most students do their project at the last minute and schedules come out toward the end of summer. Therefore, they match their classes together or see if they have the same teacher and then they share answers before school even starts. Students shouldn't be given out packets with all the exact same questions because they will just cheat and learn nothing. Instead, we should be given projects that we get to pick.\n \n If we get to pick projects that mean somethng to us then the teachers can know more about who we are and not just by some packet with questions. Students could make projects about something that happened in their life or something that means a lot to them. Most teachers don't even care to know your name not to mentin who you even are. I still have teachers that ask me what my name is when they write a pass for me and i have been in school for almost 6 months. If students could do projects that mean something to them then maybe teachers would know who they are and not just some paper they are grading.\n \n In conclsion, Students should pick their projects and desgin the projects themselves. By letting students have a choice, It helps them and teachers too. The more creative students can be the more participation there will be.

      "some schools require students to complete summer projects to make sure that kids are still learning over the summer. Leaving only one question should the projects be designed by teachers or the students. Now letting a teacher design a project over the summer rather than the student will only be like homework. Therefore you shouldnt let the teachers design it because if you have homework over the summer just like over the year nine times out of ten your not going to do it. But that does not change the fact that if a student was to design his project he or she would most likely get it done better and get it done more quicker if their designing it themselves. Then again some students may have trouble designing projects themselves. Therefore I do think teachers should design a version of the project for students that that really have the creativity or thought process to get done all on there own.\n \n Just imagine a student at home over the summer time he or she just getting out of school, going on break for two and a half months. think about what a student is going to go threw if a teacher designs a project and assign it to them. It will be way easier for the students to design there project the way they want it to be. For one there doing it over break which means the quicker he or she gets the out the way and done the better. So letting students design their own projects would better for the staff, students, and school. Making a student do teachers work over a break like the summer just isnt going to work because, if a student doesnt get the concept of the project that the teacher assigned then how is he other than looking it up on the internet which does not answer all question. Allowing students to actually get creative and design it them selves can actually help there knowledge in school and the real world. Then to go on and start the next year with good grades rather coming into a class room with an excuse because you where confused on what the teacher said.\n \n working on a project while on summer break may be hard if you got to think of it all by yourself. But not only will you have to think for your self you will have to think about how the teacher actually want this project done. I know that you'll have to worry about how the teachers want it done anyways but in this case the student will have the advantageÂ of designing the project themselves rather than having the teacher design cause any confusion. Because confusions lead to stress and stress results end with you not doing your project. which in that case you can say that it could really happen both ways but the point is that designing a project over summer break where its the student and only the student even tho sometimes he or she may have help from family membersÂ that still doesnt assure they will still get there education if their looking at something a teacher designed then letting them design it themselves. Its the students summer theey should atleast be able to design it themselves and not the teachers.\n \n In conclusion students that go to schools where they have projects overÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

      "Do you think summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed? In my opinion, summer project should be student-designed. For students, summer is a break from school; students should have the freedom to do a project based on what they want. Reasons why I believe summer projects should be student-designed is because it gives students the ability to be creative, they feel less pressured, and it gives them responsibility.\n \n First reason why I believe summer projects should be student-designed is because it gives students the ability to be creative. If students come up with what their projects is based on, it shows their creativeness. They can describe and show their personality through their project. They can also show their character and more about who they are. This can be a opportunity for students to open up with their teacher and classmates. Students can come out their comfort zone and be unique when creating their project.\n \n Second reason why I believe summer projects should be student-designed is because students feel less pressured. If students have a certain project, they feel more pressured to do exactly what the project is based on. The project may be based on a subject they may not feel comfortable with. If students have a student-designed project, they will avoid that conflict because they will be able to choose their own topic. This may also pressure students because they could get a project that doesn't appeal to their personality.\n \n Third reason why I believe summer projects should be student-designed is because it gives students responsibility. Students will have all summer to create their project; if the project is not done, it shows they aren't responsible. The project shows if they can be able to do a project before the new school year begins. Certain students will prove they're able to complete a project throughout the summer. While others will prove they aren't responsible enough to complete a project. In addition, this will give them a task to do while they aren't in school.\n \n In conclusion, I believe that summer projects should be student-based. My reasons on why I believe this should be a student-designed project is because it gives students the ability to be creative, they feel less pressured, and it gives them responsibility. A summer project should be a project you are comfortable with and can show how you unique every individual is. The project will also keep students feeling educated while not being in school.",

      "The concept of summer break presents many flaws to the school system. It causes students to lose vital information they learned the year prior and creates a lazy atmosphere with the absence of work. The clear solution to this is summer assignments and projects, yet some wonder who deserves to decide what the projects should consist of. Summer projects, a key tool to ensure continued enrichment, should be student designed to allow opportunities for creativity, increased enjoyment while working, as well as higher rates of motivation to continuously work on the project in order to nurture passion and a love for this work within students.\n \n During the school year teachers are obligated to obtain a set amount of grades and fit a certain curriculum, yet during summer these rules no longer apply. This leaves summer as the perfect time to allow for creativity with learning. One such example is the Sustainable Technology Class. This is a project driven class where students are given guidelines to fulfill and that is it. Many of the students taking this course have a passion for the material and need a chance to see all of the possibilities it can hold. With this class specific, originality could lead to a revolutionary invention, such as electricity generating bicycles or solar powered toys. Through this experience a student can truly fall in love with the world of science and decide to create a career out of it. A cpncept very similar to professors being able to do any research they can get approved within their budget. Also, including student led work could help school systems break the factory system pattern of the school year in which you do your assigned work and keep the classroom silent. Our current system, where students have very little say, easily leads to anxiety, exhaustion, and eventually, for some, fully dropping out of high school. By offering a chance to have a self designed, teacher approved project, students can fully appreciate knowledge in a way the benefits the individual.\n \n Once the door to creativity and choice has been opened, enjoyment has to follow. In 1800's France, a new style of art was emerging, impressionism. If these talented and famous painters, such as Monet and Van Gogh, solely followed the advice of their instructors and refused to step out to paint what they enjoy, we would not have beautiful works like Starry Night. If they had not branched out and followed their intuition and joy, they may never have continued painting due to constant belittlement of the art style they preferred. Our museums would be repetitions of the same work with very little diversity. This is true for essentially all art, another example of this is the Rock Revolution. If stars such as Elvis and the Beatles only followed the era of Big Band music and never were allowed to play and create what they enjoyed, music could have never evolved. With each generation, the world learns more and more. Advancements would never occur if every project was solely based off of the knowledge of the teacher.\n \n Finally, for the average student, September through June is an endless pattern of early mornings, tests, and work sheets created by their teachers. More importantly September through June is a pattern of procrastination for many students. Due to dread about a certain assignment or just plain boredom, work piles up and leaves the student to rush through it carelessly before the due date. A perfect example of this is Love Canal, New York. In the 1970's a community was built over a former dumping ground for radioactive waste. The families quickly noticed issues such as minor chemical burns from the grass and black sludge seeping into their houses, but the government ignored the growing tragedy. There was no action taken until 18 out of 21 children were born with severe chromosomalÂ defects. By this point, the government was forced to spend thousands of dollars in relocating the families as well as reparations, hospital bills, and environmental recovery. If they had not procrastinated, then it would have been considerably less expensive and would not have been as horrific as it ended up being. While this example may not directly highlight the issues within teacher driven projects, it does show what a consistent habit of procrastination can lead to. Which is what the school system instills in students by not allowing decision making. It is undeniable that when people care about the project being done, they are will put time and energy into it through out the whole experience, not just the ending.\n \n While there are some benefits to teacher driven projects, such as the possibility for concise instructions and often an obvious path to follow, these just allow the students to be overly protected and lazy. This prevents the potential for growth that comes from creating something and succeeding in it without the help of an adult. It also instills the idea that there will always be someone telling you what to do. Which is very harmful once these students get to the work field. They will be unprepared due to never doing fully original and individual work, and the school system would be the one to blame.\n \n In our modern world, we need innovation more than anything else. Young minds need to be nurtured, but also allowed to follow their own path of individuality and creativity. The only way to ensure the growth of these important traits is to loosen the leash and allow students to make some of the decisions. It is just one project per year, but a country wide switch could be revolutionary.Â",

      "Usually when school is out for summer break, you instantly forget about everything that you have learned. Nowadays, schools want you to do some of project or activity to assure that you have more knowledge and learning throughout the break. If these projects are really going to happen, they should be teacher-designed. If these projects are designed by teachers, then they are most likely going to be more educational, you can get hands-on help from a teacher, and overall they can allow you to become more prepared for the upcoming school year.\n \n Firstly, these summer projects should be teacher-designed because they can be more educational for the students. By doing this, you can learn many things that you never knew before. Such as ; a certain word problem, how to do an equation, or many other things as well. When the summer projects are finally over, you will be able to look back and see what all new information you have learned.\n \n Secondly, you can get better hands-on help from the teacher. Say one of the projects is about somethingÂ you have never seen or learned before. Obviously you are going to need to get help or a teacher's assistance. Instead of having to solve the problem by yourself, you can get someone's help so you can figure out what to do and how to do it.\n \n Thirdly, overall a project designed by a teacher will allow yourself to be be more prepared for the up and coming school year. If you have a project based on one of the classes you are going to take next year, you can start preparing based on that. You can start learning what the class is all about too. At the end of the day, no matter what type of activity or project it is, it will prepare you for the next school year.\n \n In conclusion, it is better for summer projects assigned by the school to be teacher-designed. In the end, they are way more educational than a project designed by a student them self. If you are not understanding something,or if it is difficult to complete, the teacher can help you out. Also in the long run, it will prepare and better yourself for the next school year.",

    ESSAY:
      "In the summer, learning significantly decreases in students, so it's important to continue learning. Having a summer project is a great way to do so, but is it better to have the project designed by teachers, or the students themselves? Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers know what is expected to be learned, it will be fair to the students, and teachers already have more experience in designing assignments.\n \n Teachers are already well informed about the curriculum about the subject they teach, and they also know some of the curriculum for the other classes related to the subject. For example, a math teacher for Algebra 1 has also taught Geometry in the past. Since he has experience in Geometry, he knows what his students should expect in the next year when they take Geometry. The students were only exposed to the content in Algebra 1, therefore making it more productive if the math teacher designed the summer project. By implementing content of the next school year into the summer project, students will be better prepared for the class. Because teachers teach the curriculum for the students, they know what is most important/useful to remember. For instance, a Biology 1 teacher knows that the unit focused on animal and plant cell anatomy is crucial to remember because it is always used in Biology in general, so she mostly focuses the project with cell anatomy. It is beneficial to students if they are informed what is expected to be to know in the future. Teachers who know what is most useful to know would design summer projects more effectively by knowing what content to emphasize. Students do not know what is important to learn because they are in the process of learning, so having them design summer projects would not effectively help them better prepare over the summer.\n \n If students are assigned to design a summer project, they are most likely to do something that is personalized to be easy for themselves with a lot of bias, which is not fair to everyone. Such as, English 10 students were expected to come up with comprehension questions for a book, and they ended up creating questions that were easy to them, but very difficult for other students. Students would not know how to create assessments that would cater to everyone's level of knowledge. Since teachers oversee the class, they would know what kinds of questions to create that would best fit for the class's knowledge, with no bias. If there was student bias involved in designing a project, many other students will have complaints and disagree with the components of the project. For example, a history teacher who assigned a project did not receive a single complaint compared to when a student proposed a project. If students know that the project was designed by the teacher, it will significantly decrease the amount of complaints and the students would just accept it because he is a higher authority. By having the teacher design the project, students will all have a fair assignment to do with no bias since it was designed by the teacher. Having students design a project could create a lot of disagreement.\n \n Teachers have more experience in teaching and the basics of learning. They have traditionally always created and designed assignments in the past. For instance, a Psychology teacher has been teaching for over ten years knows how to create effective projects for his students. Since he has been teaching for over ten years, he has more experience and knows what he is doing. People with more experience can design better quality projects than someone who is still learning, Teachers know what techniques to use to effectively assess knowledge. An example is that an English teacher added more steps for annotating a book because she knows that it actually helps students understand the book better. A student would not like to add more steps in annotating a book because it is more work, but they do not know that is is very helpful in the long run. The process of learning is more likely to be effective if the assignment was designed by a teacher because they have more experience. It is important for students to learn with purpose and practice beneficial habits.\n \n If teachers designed summer projects, it would be beneficial to the students' learning. It would ensure that students are learning the correct information needed, would be be just for all the students, and it would be more efficient since teachers have more experience. The purpose of summer projects is to continue learning in students over the break, and teachers definitely have the power to do that.",

      "Summer projects, some schools have these projects to complete during the summmer so students do not have to completley stop learning during the break. The assignments are more than likely created by a teacher; What if the students created the assignments though?\n \n i believe that if student's created the project it would probably be easier than a teachers project, for the benefit of summer. On the other hand if teachers designs the project it will come with more work and more information for the benefit of real learning.\n \n Student designed projects, in my opinion, will probably help teachers in the short run because of the fact that teachers will not have to worry about creating a project. In the long run though, i believe students will not learn anything new. i think student's will just create it and make it easy just to get it over with and begin their summer. Or make it easy enough to just procrastinate about it all break and complete it at the end of summer. Even creating the project is more work for the students which i think will have some students not even trying to do it. If the project is created by students i think mostly all of the students will complete it and turn it in because of how easy they made it to be.\n \n Teacher designed projects, These projects will have what the teacher's and school want students to study during break. Teachers will actually create it to be work that will leave students with information that is needed and that should not be forgotten, for future puposes like for classes that they will be taking when back from break. I think a good amount of people would not complete the assignment due to the fact that teachers make them hard and actually have you do work. Students would rather be doing anything than a project during the summer. Teacher designed projects will help students out more in the long run because teacher's know what students need to study and focus on.\n \n So, in my opinion a teacher designed project is for the benefit of the student's learning. A student designed project though, is for the benefit of the student's summer. In both cases though the student is going to be working on it thoughout summer and keeping in touch with learning. I think it would be best if a teacher designed project was given for the summer. If the chance was given to me to create one though, i would definetly rather do that.Â",

      "In some schools, summer projects are assigned to assure that students will continue learning well after the school year ends. Although students should continue to learn during their break, some have argued that if the projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed. Student-designed is the better option because students will have more options to chose from, they can do a project they're interested in, and teacher-designed projects are annoying to produce.\n \n Many teachers would complain that students won't have any directions to follow on their projects and will thus not continue learning during their break. Although, students not having any directions on how to make their projects is true. This can be viewed as a purely subjective point, since this'll give students more freedom on how they want their projects to be. Another point of discussion is is that students won't continue to further learn during their break. This viewpoint that students won't continue to learn is wrong due to the fact that students will be learning while creating their projects.\n \n Having more options for students to choose from is great because students can create a project of something they're interested in with high effort. In the past, teachers would only give students one option for a project idea; therefore, limiting the chance of something that student would interested in and lowering the effort. For example, if a student was given the freedom to write about a certain sport they're interested in, they could make a well informed slide show to present to a class or could talk forever about their favorite team in a podcast. A student would choose to write something they're interested rather than having to read a long book than having to write a big ESSAY any day.\n \n Students can make projects more enjoyable is a valid point because it can show their creativity. Since students won't have any directions on how to make their projects, they can be as creative as they want. They can try out new ways to present projects like showing a cool infographic or make a fun video that can inform a class about a topic they worked on. This could make the actual work process of the project more enjoyable to the student and whoever they're presenting it too.\n \n The third reason why student-designed is the better option is because teachers can make projects annoying for the students. Teachers can sometimes make students go out of their way to work on their projects. To include, teachers can make it so students have to visit somewhere to get information to further continue working on their projects or make students have to buy certain books to write about. This may not seem so bad at first glance; however, for some students who go visit out of the country for the majority of the break can be a nightmare for them. Imagine a student being gone for the majority of the break just to come back and only have a little less than week to visit a musesum and write an ESSAY about it. This situation shows how teachers make projects annoying for these types of students.\n \n In conclusion, a student-designed project is better because students can choose what they want to talk about, projects would be more enjoyable for everyone, and students won't have to go out of their way from teacher-designed projects. Having more freedom in options leads to students picking something they're interested in.\n \n Students also show their creativity thus making it more enjoyable. finally, teachers make students go out of their way for projects; therefore, making it annoying for some students who travel.",

      "Summer break, most students favorite time of the year, the time of long hot summer days by the pool or even at the beach. This break given is a moderate period of time given to students and teachers throughoutÂ the hottest months of the year. Many children spend this time with their friends and family, some even take the opportunity to get a summer job. However some schools feel it is necessary to give their students an excessive amount of school work to do complete the summer. Many of these summer assignments are from classes including Math, English, and even some AP classes. Most summer assignments given do not provide an explanation of how to complete it, which leaves many students clueless and with no desire to complete their task. Students should be provide to pick an assignment that appeals most to them, in order to give them a drive to complete the work.\n \n Summer break is supposed to be enjoyable days away from school with no stress. Giving these students school work over their times off is not fair to them nor is it fair to the teachers. When this work is given, large amounts of students choose not to complete it; or they chose to complete it but not with the best of their abilities. Most summer assignments that are given are not beneficial to the student when they return to school. In fact, many teachers do not discuss the summer assignment with the students and some have even chose to not put in the grade because many of their students did not complete it, which is not fair to the students that took the time out of their summer to complete it. With summer assignments being mandatory, students should be able to choose their assignments based on the classes they will be taking, in order to make their summer a little more enjoyable. No student wants to complete an assignment they have no interest in.\n \n Almost all teachers a facultyÂ spend their summer days off relaxing with their families and enjoying their time off, as they should. However they do not grade nor complete assignments for the students. Yes toward the end of the summer teachers have to go back to school earlier than their students to ensure their rooms are set up, cleaned, and ready for the children to return. School faculty also have to attend a few meetings together to make sure the upcoming school year will go smoothly. If students apply their summer time to the assignments the teachers should also apply their time to explaining the assignments throughly before their vaction.\n \n A class that students need to have in order to continue learning over the summer, is math. Math is a subject that people use everyday. The assignments math teachers give should provide helpful ways for the student to learn and complete the assignment if it is something they may not know how to do. Most students do complete their summer assignments before summer break, which means they can ask for help from teachers around them. However some wait until they have down time to complete these assignments which causes them to forget how to complete it. All assignments that are given should give the student a clear understanding of how the teacher may want it to be completed, with an example to help assist the student for when the teacher is not around.\n \n If the summer assignment that is assigned does not benefit the student and will not be brought up or discussed after they turn it in, it should not be given for them to complete on their days off. The assignments teachers assign are usually not enjoyable and take large periods of time to complete. IfÂ assignmentsÂ must be given over the summer, students should have a choice from a variety of assignments to choose from; such as a power pointÂ on somewhere historical they could have visited over the summer or even reading a chosen book the class will read together during theÂ upcomingÂ school year\n \n Students should not have to take time out of their days off the complete an assignment that will not help them in the up coming school year. Many students find summer assignments boting and unenjoyable, which is why they choose to not complete them.

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue their learning during the break. Every individual at some point in their life has had to make a project of their own. Whether it be a project at school or a project at home for themselves to enjoy. So when it comes to these summer projects, they should be student-designed because an individual has more freedom to choose a topic of their own, they are less restrictive, and students can use their best strengths to make a project that is less stressful for them.\n \n A student has more freedom when choosing a topic of their own with a student-designed project. For instance, a lot of the projects in school are tied to a specific topic. When it comes to choosing the type of project, at a first glance, there may seem like there is a lot to choose from. But in reality, this is just the illusion of choice. There isn't a lotÂ of room for creativity and imagination, therefore there isn't much freedom. Many individuals will agree that with more freedom, they have the liberties and creativity to come up with something that is unique. Others may argue that with more freedom, a student might not stick to what they what they are supposed to learn, But that is far from the truth. It is the opposite, students are more restricted when they are forced to create a project with a topic they are not the best at, which leads to the next point.\n \n Student-designed projects are less restrictive. For instance, much of the work we are assigned in school is teacher-designed. From personal experience, when a project is teacher-designed, a lot of the work can be mediocre, as apposed to a project that is student-designed. When students aren't allowed to come up with their own ideas, their imagination is bound and restricted. Some teachers may argue that it doesn't matter that students are restricted, all that matters is that a student gets the work done, but that is not correct. The student wont be as motivated and will turn in a project that is has no effort, therefore getting a lower grade.\n \n individuals can use their best strengths to make a project that is less stressful for them with student-designed projects. A project can seem like a large and outstanding task to finish for a large amount of students, and as a result, puts stress on an individual. A student-designed project can relieve plenty of this stress, as students can choose a subject that they are best at. It is easier for someone as they are more comfortable with a topic they are more knowledgeable with. Other individuals may argue that students should make an effort to choose a subject they aren't familiar with, but many can disagree because choosing a topic someone isn't familiar with puts more stress on a person and can lead to them struggling to learn.\n \n Summer projects help students learn during the break, but students should ultimately decide on designing their own projects for individuals to continue to learn. At the end of the day, they should have the freedom to enjoy doing what they are best at they shouldnt be stressed over work they aren't comfortable with in the summer.Â  Â Â Â Â Â",

In ways such as they can actually know what topic or subject they are doing,it can show one students creativity abilities,and the students may be really be interested in the project that they are doing.\n \n First,when teachers assign a summer project it might be something that the student may not know or can not get a grasp of because it is too difficult for them to understand.

      "Its that time of year where students have to complete a summer project. These projects are a way of making sure that the students are learning and being productive throughout their summer vacation. Students best know their own interests, so, summer projects should be student-designed because it ensures that students will be engaged, leads to completion of the project, and promotes the continuation of their interests.\n \n Although, some people may think that student-designed summer projects are not the best way to have students continue their education. For the reasons of it leads to researching non-important topics or results in students not taking the project seriously. This point of view makes sense because if the projects are teacher-designed it would ensure that all students are learning about something important and valuable to their education. However, this point of view is wrong because the definition of an important topic is different to everyone. Students will do the summer project on something of importance or value to them because they have the option to make it something or their own and make it unique.\n \n Students will always become engaged in a topic if the have the freedom to choose it. While students are getting ready to choose what they want to do during the summer they will become interested about the topic they choose. This will make sure that students are kept interested throughoutÂ the summer to produce something that they are proud of. For example, a students favorite animal is a panda and he or she wants to research, visit museums, visit libraries, and visit the zoo to learn more about them and be able to come up with a good project. This student is eager to learn about something he or she loves and is passionate about. This project will keep this student fully engaged through the summer learning about the panda. All students have something that they are interested in and if they choose a topic and create a project it may even open and door to a passion they were not aware of.\n \n In addition, the completion of the student-designed summer project is critical to their learning because without the completion of it students will not get the full experience of learning what they picked on their project. If students are allowed to design their own projects the teachers will not have to worry about a students not completing the project because they became uninterested or bored. Students will be eager to complete their projects and that is all a teacher could want is to have a student eager about a project and then complete it because they wanted to not because they were forced to. For example a student is given the topic of rocks and the student has never had an interest in this. The student will struggle because they have no interest in researching rocks. This student will most likely not complete the project or will do it in the last week of summer. This prevents students of having a valuable learning experience with something that they like.\n \n As well as students having a variety of interests, if the summer projects are student-designed they could explore an area of interest that they are already familiar with and dive in deep to what they like. This could help a student find out more information on a topic they think they may like or already know that they have a passion for. For example, if a student is interested in medicine and they want to become a doctor why would they need to research rocks? This student will have the time to research what she wants to do with her future while also completing her schools requirement. It is a great thing for a young student to already be setting their mind into what they will like to do in their future and researching it.\n \n Summer learning projects should be student-designed because it help ensure that students will be engaged, leads to project completion, and allows for the continuation of personal interests. Students need to have a time to be able to research and make a project on a topic that they enjoy learning about and what better time than the summer to do that. Young students are the future, so, the schools should permit student-designed summer projects to have the students better understand the topic of their choice. The next time students have to do summer project they should be allowed to designÂ it and stride for their best educational experience.Â  Â Â Â",

      "Summer Projects\n \n Summer break is a students favorite time of year. It is a vacation from school, five days a week, for three months. The only exception to this is a summer project. Teachers assign summer projects to their upcoming classes, so when school starts again they have not forgotten everything they previously learned and are prepared for what the new school year has in store. Although some people can argue that students should be given options for their summer assignments, it is best to leave that job to the professionals because they are the ones trying to refresh, prepare, and teach students. Even if the teacher does pick the topic, that does not mean students cannot be creative and think outside the box.\n \n If students got to pick their own topics, maybe they would feel inspired and put in more effort, but it is more likely that they would do something easy they already know about. The whole point of a summer project is to keep their brain refreshed over the summer. For example, if your teacher asked you to read any book and write a report on it, it would be easy to pick a book you have already read or even Google a summary of a random book, but if your teacher picked the book, then you would read a book you probably have not read and actually learn something new.Â Copying down what you find online or using a book you read two years ago will not help you grow academically or refresh your mind.\n \n The whole point of a summer project is to keep their brain refreshed over the summer. Since teachers already know the curriculum, before the year even starts, a simple summer project is perfect to keep their brain active while familiarizing them with new material. Even just writing a short poem inspired by the Romanticism Era with an analysis is a good way to introduce a subject they might not know a lot about. Summer projects do not have to be hard or long, just enough to give a preview of what they will be learning. A specific topic also allows a more detailed rubric because it tells you exactly what to do, whereas if everyone picked, the rubric would not be specific or very helpful.\n \n Teachers can pick the topic of a summer assignment without taking the individuality out. If the teacher picks a topic, it is obviously something they know about already. Teachers picking the assignment also reduces confusion and encourages student collaboration to talk to each other about the task to better understand. Any project you get regardless of it being during the summer or the school is meant to prepare you for the future. High school is all about preparing you, whether that is something as small as starting a new school year to going to college.\n \n Every single thing you do in life can teach you something. That is why teachers are so important because they get paid to teach students, like me. Even if it seems pointless, it is important to still do it because in the end, just completing the task shows perseveranceÂ and teaches students not to procrastinate. Nobody would hand out projects for fun. All assignments are to benefit their students in the long run. It is also important to try to have fun while doing school work because if your mind is open to new things, you might like what you are learning. Getting assigned a topic is not meant to put you in a box, it is meant to give a topic to explore.\n \n We should leave the teaching to the teachers. Let them decide the best way to teach us because that is what they are here for. If they want us to really understand their lessons, they should pick the assignments to ensure they get the results they desire. Teachers went to school to learn the best methods of teaching, so we should trust them to refresh, prepare, and teach students everything they need to know.",

      "As the school year comes to an end, the school halls are filled with students' conversing about their summer plans, an the joys of the school year being over. However, for many students, school isn't nearly over. Some schools task their students with summer projects to ensure that students keep learning outside of the school year. Ultimately, it is questioned whether the project should be teacher-designed, or student-designed. When a student is given the power to design their own project, it allows the student to grow mentally and help broaden their learning horizons. This allows students to base their project on something that they are heavily interested in, others might even venture beyond what they are already familiar with, and lastly it motivates them to complete their assignment with passion.\n \n It is very often that when a student is told they must complete a project based off a topic that they aren't interested in, their initial thought may be that the project will be boring and difficult. However, when they are allowed to chose their topic, it is very likely that their perspective might change into a more positive point of view. When picking topics for a project, most students are inclined to base it on something that they have a liking for. When I was in middle school, I was part of a program called the\n \n Gifted and Talented, this program was centered on both, group and individual projects. We had been assigned a project in honor of Earth Day and due to my immense love and interest for marine life, I had decided on creating a vessel that would roam the ocean and detect any trash that had been tossed into the water, and collect it. After I had researched where most ocean trash was found, I had decided that this vessel would remain near beaches and ports. If the teacher had designed the project and told us that we had to create something on a specific topic such as, prevention of forest fires, there could have been a chance that I hadn't been as enthused and wouldn't have tried as much.Â Not only did this project help me think outside the box, but it also helped me decide on my future career by allowing me to research more on a topic that I was interested in.\n \n Furthermore, instead of sticking with something familiar, students might try and explore other topics in which they lack knowledge. By learning about different subjects, one is able to broaden their educational horizons, which may come in handy later on in life. I once new a woman who arrived at college \"undecided\". She was unsure of what to major in, and she was later told that she needed to complete a project in a subject of her choosingÂ by the end of the year. Soon after the news, she realized that she needed to decide on a project fast, so she decided she would join her parish during one of their visits to a poor community out of town. She had no knowledge of how to help the people in the community, but she believed that she would be able to both accomplish her project, and make an impact on these people's lives. Her project was then completed after she spent her summer building ramps, cooking meals, and painting murals for that community. Soon after her project was completed, she decided that she would major in Social Services, because making an impact in people's lives and helping them achieve a better life was something she would want to do as a career.\n \n By being able to choose her project, she was able to broaden all of her horizons and grow as a person as well as mentally mature through her experiences. Once again, if there had been restrictions on that project and it was no longer on a topic of her choosing, but instead she had to complete a paper on politics, she could've spent a couple more years undecided, or she could've dropped out of college.\n \n Lastly, when students are allowed to design their own projects, they not only take their time to complete their project, but they pay attention to every last detail, and make sure that everything is done to their liking. It can be said that some of these projects are the result of passion. For example, during my Sophomore year in high school, I was assigned a project based off a genocide of my choosing. OriginallyÂ I thought I would do this project on the Rwandan genocide, but thought better of it since I was already familiar with it. In the end, I decided on the Cambodian Genocide and decided I would be doing a scrapbook for the execution of the project. At first the research was a bit slow since I was unfamiliar with the topic, but as I learned more about the subject, I found a passion for the project I didn't know I had. I began working on the scrapbook everyday after school over the course of a month. By the time the deadline had come, the project had been completed and was ready to be displayed on Genocide Night. In the end, I was able to score a high grade, and even used my research for a project assigned for my art class a year later.\n \n All in all, student designed projects are beneficial for the student as it gives them the opportunity to increase their knowledge in a variety of topics as well as help them mentally mature. When given the choice to infinite possibilities, there is plenty of space for infinite success. Teacher designed projects, more often than not, are usually seen as boring, time consuming tasks, because they are created by someone that doesn't have a students interests in mind. Projects assigned during the school year are solely based on the topic they are learning, or book they are reading in class. However, summer projects should not have that restriction despite the project's purpose of making sure that students are learning. Students should be allowed to take the reigns on their projects, and lead them in the direction that they want to go in. When students are given the freedom of choosing, they are more inclined to learn and retain that information, then when they are forced to learn about things they could care less about.Â",

    ESSAY:
      "As the school year comes to a close, countless students look forward to spending their days relaxing by the pool, going on vacation, and hanging out with their friends. For some, however, the beginning of summer break also means preparing for the next school year. Summer assignments are common among advanced high school classes, and are equally dreaded by most high school students. Moreover, teacher-designed projects do not spark much interest from those who must complete them. Schools that require students to complete summer projects should allow students to design their assignments because it promotes responsibility, keeps students interested, and provides more opportunities for students in school and in the future.\n \n When completing an assignment over the summer break, students are responsible for setting time aside in order to work and study. A good sense of responsibility is an essential part of designing a project and making sure it gets done. When crafting a project, students are responsible for creating their own ideas and implementing them correctly, in order to create an interactive and challenging assignment. Without good time management skills, a student may fall behind, leaving them with a sub par project, and most likely a disappointed teacher. Allowing a student to take the lead on designing a project will promote the necessary components of learning good time management. As well as time management, a student also learns how to balance priorities. Yes, summer is an amazing opportunity to have fun, but it also provides the means to be better prepared for the school year. When a student decides to prioritize a summer project over a video game or TV program, they set themselves up for future success in the form of a high grade. Focusing on one's priorities teaches them a great deal of responsibility, and can be applied to many different situations in the future. Allowing a student to design their own project teaches them how to effectively manage their time and understand their priorities, leading them to become more responsible.\n \n When a student learns or studies about something they are interested in, they are able to absorb more information. Letting a student design their own project will assist in a more powerful learning experience. If a student who was interested in trains received a project about frogs, chances are he/she would quickly become disinterested and bored. A student would perform far better on an assignment that their interests can be applied to. A student designed project promotes creativity, as well as sponsoring individuality. Moreover, it is almost impossible for a teacher to design a project that caters towards all the needs and interests of his/her students. A student-lead project would return higher grades and provide a way for a teacher to further understand each of her students, the way they learn, and their personal interests. This allows for a stronger relationship between a teacher and /his/her class, and creates a more beneficial learning environment. The decision to allow students to design their own projects will make for a more impactful, enjoyable, and interesting learning experience.\n \n Lastly, a student-designed project will provide more opportunity for students to expand their network, and discover what they want to study and achieve in the future. When working on a project or assignment that is based off the personal interests of an individual student, they could be inspired to study further into their chosen subject, and provide them with an idea of what they want in the future. A student who studies trains could soon realize that he/she is more interested in planes, and now wants to be a pilot. They could also be influenced to join a school club or get a job that pertains to their chosen subject. The ideas that they create when designing their own project can be applied to their goals for the future. As well as providing ideas for their career and future studies, they will also be able to expand their network of people who have the same aspirations as them. Designing a project allows for one to work with many different people, such as a partner or group, and offers the means to build new relationships and acquaintances. The idea of a student-designed summer project is more effective in expanding a student's knowledge of personal goals, and provides an environment with many opportunities to meet new people and discover new ideas.\n \n In conclusion, the benefits of a student-designed project are far greater than those of a teacher-designed project. Students learn new skills, such as responsibility and time management. They are also provided with opportunity to expand their knowledge, discover their interests, and discover themselves as an individual. The people they meet and work with throughout designing and completing a summer project will benefit them in school, further studies, and possibly even the work force. The idea of a student-designed project proves itself to be a more beneficial, rewarding, and fun experience.Â  Â Â Â Â",

      "Many schools across the country require students to complete summer assignments to assure that they continue their pursuit of knowledge even without a teacher present. But should these assignments be designed by the teacher or should they be designed by the student? If a student were given freedom with their project, it would be a lot more enjoyable rather than if a teacher put strict conditions on it. But a lack of strictness would mean that students are less likely to complete their project and they wouldn'tÂ know when the work they have done is enough. Teachers should put that restriction on the student and give them a specific assignment to ensure that the appropriate amount of work gets done.\n \n Students are less likely to complete a project that they have freedom on and if they do complete it, the quality would suffer greatly compared to if a teacher gave them a prompt or a specific task to accomplish. The point of a summer assignment is to prevent to student from losing knowledge or getting rusty because of a break. Although the point of the summer break is to let students relax until the next year starts, it's still important that they keep their studies up. Assignments shouldn'Â be student-designed because that would allow too much leisure and when school comes around, most students would not have it done. For example, I had two summer assignments last summer. One was for English and one was for Math. For the English one, the assignment was to read any book of my choosing and write a review about it. This assignment had very unclear instructions and I, the student, was supposed to add my own twist to it and complete the assignment however I wanted to. I started on the assignment, but never finished it because I didn't have the motive since there was no specific prompt to answer to, so I wrote a couple of sentences and called it quits. But for the Math assignment, I had a packet to complete of practice problems. The finish was in sight and crystal clear. I did it throughout the summer and finished it by August. The reassurance I felt that once I did a specific amount of work and followed the teacher's directions, I would be done is what encouraged me to finish. The English assignment was unclear and I didn't know how much to complete to make sure that I was on track for next year.\n \n Summer assignments are important for a student and the reason to have them teacher-designed is to give the student reassurance and to make sure the student doesn't do too much work over what's supposed to be a break, yet it keeps them on track. If an assignment is student-designed then the student will do one of three things: overwork themselves, not fully apply their capabilities, or not do the work at all. For these reasons, summer assignments should all be teacher-designed.",

      'Some schools that require students to complete summer projects to assure kids continue to learn over break is a smart idea. Yet, the question "Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student- designed?" Can determine if a student will enjoy and do the work that they are assigned. These projects should be student-designed because this will cause a higher percent of students to do the work, while enjoying the experience, students can learn about something that they want, and teachers will be able to learn about the new students coming to their class.\n \n There is always a problem with kids not doing their assigned work. Starting off the year with a incomplete project could ruin the year for some. If students were allowed to design the project, they would be choosing topics that they are likely to complete, and ones that they can enjoy. There is a direct correlation with kids who enjoy the topic they are learning about and completion rate of projects. Student-designed projects may lead to a higher percent of kids doing their work and less kids pushing off projects till the last minute. This can assure that kids will be learning the matirial over summer break.\n \n Projects don\'t always have to be strictly information that we cover in school, sometimes it is good to learn about something that interests the individual. With student-designed projects, students will have the freedom to chose what they want to learn about. Giving this opportunity to students will allow them to show their interests to teachers and their peers. Having kids focus on something they find interesting, increases their drive to learn new information, which will help them throughout the upcoming school year.\n \n Student-designed projects will not only benefit students, teachers will learn about new students as the school year starts. Having teachers learn about students can help build important teacher-student relationships. Teacher-student relationships are important to develop throughout the year, so students feel they have a safe place to go if they need help or if they have had a bad day. Many students tend to have hard times learning from teachers they dont respect, or like. Projects that are student-designed will increase the trust kids have in their teachers, as well as teachers about new students.\n \n While some teachers and school officials may not be in favor of student-designed projects because it could be hard to grade if the teacher does not know the topic being presented. Many people would argue that students should not be the only people learning new things. Teachers should be able to learn about topics the students are interested in to better the way they interact with students. Although, teachers might not be experts on these topics, grade should not be on the information, rather on the way the student presents the information and how they researched each topic.\n \n While the answer to teacher-designed projects or student-designed projects can be up for debate their are many reason to why a student-designed project are better than teacher-designed project. The level of completion, student interest, and allowing for better teacher-student relationship are all very important to assure that students will continue to learn over break.Â',

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. This helps them to keep their brain running. I believe that the students should get to design what project they want to do. Choosing their project will guarantee that they are focused while working on it, they will choose a topic that interests them, and their grade will result at a higher score.\n \n Allowing students to choose their projects will help keep them focused on it. For example, if a student likes things related to writing, they will enjoy working on it. They will give it all their effort and time. It also allows them to focus more on the topic itself. Being home will let also let them be comfortable working on their projects. They will not be distracted by any classmates. They will feel less pressured by their teachers to get things done. They will be able to pace themselves. And their hard work will be reflected in their projects.\n \n Students tend to get exited about a topic they are interested in. Giving them the freedom to do so will result in a better researched project. They will also be interested in similar things, so they will continue to research without them being told to do so. The quality of their project will be reflected by their interest in the topic they choose.\n \n Some people may believe that getting their research project assigned by a teacher is better. I disagree with this statement. Students will feel the pressure of getting the assignment done because a teacher told them to do so. Some may even do the project last minute because they were not interested in the topic. Or maybe they were not comfortable working on it. Their efforts to work on the project will be decreased, resulting in a much lower grade. If a student chooses the topic they want to work on, and the time they dedicate to working on it, they will get a higher score. It will assure that the students continue to learn during their break.\n \n In conclusion, a student-designed project will ensure they continue to learn over the break. They will get to enjoy their break and learn at the same time. A teacher-designed project will make them lose interest and effort. What would you prefer?Â",

    ESSAY:
      "Imagine you just finished your sophomore year of high school. Summer has finally arrived! The whole Summer is yours for you to do anything and everything you want to do... except for your Summer assignment. In one class, your teacher has assigned you to run a specific research project that encompasses all the main ideas of the subject. In another class, the teacher has given you the assignment of designing and completing your own project. You sit down and think. Which one of these projects will teach me the subject better? Summer project assignments should be designed by the teacher of the course's project since it would avoid students designing projects that are not challenging enough, teachers know the subject better, and they are trained to give the right assignments for effective teaching.\n \n First and foremost, high school students are known to avoid the heavier workload if given the choice of a lighter one, even if the heavier workload will benefit them in the long run. For example, I've had the experience of having a history class assign more work one year, and the next year's history class assign less. In the class with more projects and work given, I learned the material more thoroughly and can still apply the material I learned to other situations. On the other hand, I can't remember much of the material from the class that gave me less work and projects. Though I enjoyed the lighter class, I learned that more work is equivalent to a better understanding of the subject. This, therefore, means that students, with their preference for less work, would not benefit from designing their own project since they'd simply design a light and extremely easy project.\n \n Another reason why teachers should design Summer projects is that they know the subject they teach better than the students they are assigning the project to. Teachers, apart from having learned and gone through the same classes as the students they teach, have also gone to college and studied the subject in a lot more depth for years. They simply know more than the student and know what projects helped them, as students, learn the material. A chemistry teacher, for example, is going to know what project to give to students in order for the student to learn chemistry since the students haven't even taken the class yet. Students do not know what projects will teach them effectively.\n \n Additionally, teachers have gone through years of schooling and college to get to the position they are in, as well as probably having years of teaching experience. They have been trained to teach students effectively and know what methods of teaching work best. This also means that teachers know which projects and what approach to projects are best for students. In my science class one year I had the option of designing and running my own experiment. I chose the easiest option and ended up doing badly since there were no instructions or guidelines for the experiment. I did learn from my mistakes and having to teach myself the subjects related to the experiment, but the experiment was mostly a fiasco. I learned the subjects a lot better when my teacher gave us a project that had clear intentions and guidelines that guided us to the main lesson we were being taught rather than just a project of doing whatever thrown at us. Teacher usually knows best.\n \n After a few moments of thinking, you come to the conclusion that teacher-designed projects teach you better and more effectively. Yes, you as a student do know how you yourself learn better than a teacher knows how you specifically learn. Yes, students can also learn from the process and mistakes of designing a project, but the truth is that the likelihood of at least the majority of students putting the effort into their project to put these ideas into account is very low. Teachers know how to teach and what projects to give to students to effectively teach. Now, you sit down and start your projects.",

      "Over the summer, students forget a lot of what they learned during the previous year; some even have trouble writing after summer break. This is why some schools have projects over the summer, such as summer reading. These projects should be designed by teachers because the teachers know how to incorporate important aspects of the course that they are teaching into a project, and because the students don't know the material in the course as well as the teachers do.\n \n Teachers know how to introduce their students to new material, or prepare them to be introduced to new material; they are professionals at it. Many teachers have years of experience, or at the very least, they can go to another teacher in their department for help creating an idea for a project. Therefore, they should be able to curate a project that allows their upcoming students to be prepared for their class. While they may not be teaching new material with these projects, they are preparing their students for the rest of the year.\n \n Some may argue that students should create ideas for projects for their fellow students because they themselves are students, and know what would have helped them. However, their teachers know the material better, and have a better understanding of what they can do to ensure the success of their students. Many students don't even remember what they learned at the beginning of the year. If they don't remember what they learned at the beginning of the school year, they can't come up with ideas for a project to introduce them to that material. Students don't want to do homework during the summer. If they were tasked with coming up with a project that introduces upcoming students to the material, they may just create a project that is easy but does not introduce the material well, in order to have less work to do over the summer.\n \n Teachers should design summer projects for their students, because they know what they are teaching and how to incorporate the meaningful ideas from their class into a project, and because they know their curriculum better than their students do. Teachers are the ones ensuring that their students are prepared and know the material, and it is their responsibility to prepare their students for their curriculum.

      "When was the last time you have been assigned a project over summer break? My last summer project was this past summer. It was a history project that took me days to complete. All I remember was dreading to work on the project because I already knew the information that it was about. Instead of the summer project being only a review, it should have been both a review and new information. Students get bored learning the same thing over and over again. They need something to help them for the upcoming year as they enter a new class. Therefore, summer projects should be student-designed because students would learn better, use their creative ability, and be more motivated to complete the project.\n \n Summer projects should not be about keeping the student busy. They should be about preparing the student for the new class along with helping the student retain past information. If the projects were student-designed, then students would be more likely to learn better. When I was in tenth grade, our task was to create our own project based off a certain number of topics that were given to us. I chose to do my project about World War Two. Since I chose something that I am interested in, I learned a lot of new information and information that I already knew. If I was assigned a project about old civilizations, then I probably wouldn't have learned as well as I did. This is a prime example showing how a student-designed project will help a student learn better.\n \n Creativity is something that is difficult to express for students. There are very little opportunities to express who you really are in school. Every small chance that a student gets to show their personality is an opportunity. This is another reason why summer projects should be student-designed. Furthermore, if a summer project was student-designed, then that student will have a ton of opportunities to create something that represents them. For example, an artsy student might pick a project that involves drawing or painting. An athletic student might pick a project that involves a challenge. Finally, a studious student might do a project that has a lot of work. The possibilities are endless. Having each and every student express who they are can inspire many in and out of school. This is only the second reason why summer projects should be student-designed.\n \n The last reason summer projects should be student-designed is because the students would be more motivated to complete the project. Summer is the only time that students have a long-tern break. They don't think about school or learning too often. The last thing they want to think about is another project that their teacher assigned to them. Their motivation to complete this project is very low. The only way to help motivate students would be to allow the project to be student-designed. It needs to be a project that they will enjoy doing. It can't be just another project that the teacher assigns just because why not. Last year, in chemistry, I was allowed to pick my project for my end of year science research project. I picked a topic that I wanted to see the outcome of. Throughout the entire project, I was motivated to complete it. This is because I chose what I wanted to do. Some people might say that a student can be motivated to complete a project even if it is teacher-designed. The counter to this is that when a student designs a project that they are interested in, the likelihood for that student to complete the project increases greatly. This is because they know what they want to learn about and what is interesting for them. Every little bit of motivation can help a student learn more than they thought.\n \n As you can see, student-designed projects are way better than boring teacher-designed projects. These were only just a few reasons why student-designed projects are better. Now that you know which one is better, I encourage all people to advocate around their community to make this a reality. Every student should be able to do a project on what they want to learn about. If we all used our voice to express our thoughts, then our planet would be a much better place in and outside of school.",

      "Some schools are required to assign assignments to their students to do a summer project during their summer break, but I believe that students should'nt be required to have summer projects. And I also believe that student should have a student-designed say in this because it's their choice based on if they would rather have summer assignments or not. I get it teachers want students to have summer assignments so that they're still learning but if students have assignments during their time off is that even summer break if students still have to do work during thier break.\n \n One reason why I believe that students should'nt have summer projects is because it is summer and student just want to enjoy their break and have fun. Student should have a say in this is because it's their choice if they would like to do summer projects or just enjoy and relax. I think most student would rather pick having fun and relaxing over summer projects, because for nine months students are going at least to 7 classes for nine months and learning new things, also doing projects, homework, classwork and more. If students had to have a vote for summer assignments or having a summer break without any summer projects, the majority of the students would pick summer break without any summer projects.\n \n Another reason why I believe students should design summer projects is because some students might get overwhelmed and very stressed out. School can be really stressful especially if you're failing some of your classes and getting a lot of work. Another reason why I think school is stressful is because you have seven classes and most teachers asign assignments to their students, this can be stressful for students because they have a lot of work to finish and some assignment are due the next or next class and they have to think about their other class assignments. Most students have a job and they won't have time to their summer assignment or they either went to vaction because summer time is about relaxing and having no worries, it should be a stress free summer. Summer is a time to enjoy while there is no school or no work assignments, summer break is a time to spend time with family and go to fun places and explore new things and places, not just doing school work while it is summer break.\n \n The final reason why I believe that student should have a say in summer project is because students should have a good time off. Students should'nt have summer projects because some students might go to summer school and have to do more work on top of summer projects, while they're doing summer school work , it could lead to some students not doing the summer project because summer school is too much stress for them. When student are in school they aren't really going on vaction or they aren't going out as much having fun because of school. The majority of the student don't want to miss school because if they miss school for a day it can back up them up from learning and not knowing anything that is going on in class. And summer break is about going out on vaction and exploring new things and adventure's, also not having to worry what time they have to be home for school or doing any assignment because it is summer break they should be able to enjoy it until school starts again. The majority of students don't go out on school day or during the weekends because they're either busy, working or just don't have time, that's why we have summer break so that we can relax and have fun and not worry about summer assignments.\n \n In conclusion these are the three main reasons as to why I believe that students should be students should not be assigned summer projects , so that they can enjoy their summer vaction off and being stress free until school starts again, I also believe that all students and staff should have off so that they all get a break and time off to relax and have family time.Â",

By having students plan their own summer assignments, students can still excel and be ready for school when they return, and have that ideal Summer that isn't behind a book or keyboard.\n \n Giving students the opportunity to create, and design their own Summer work opens endless opportunities and can actually inspire learning new things inside and outside of the standard curriculum. By having majority of students elect a certain amount of peers to create these assignments for them, which would give a students insight on how much work we should be given, and how flexible it should be. Teachers still will have to approve of the work created and revise if, and as needed to make sure it is adequate and follows the curriculum to prepare students. With all of this said and done, many arguments can arise about how elected students could give minimalist work because they feel pressured by friends and other peers to make it easy, which is all more reasons teachers should still oversee the process, and decide if it is fair or not.\n \n If schools eventually decide to let students design, and assign their own Summer homework this could still come with much skepticism, being a new concept means it could come with some minor flaws to be discovered. Yet with the proper determination and open willingness to change both students and teachers can benefit and be ready for the new school year when they return with the newly founded knowledge they need to succeed in their new year, while having their ideal vacations and spending time with their family instead of being behind a book or keyboard.",

      "One time in the 5th grade me and my classmates were given an assignment that we were told to design by ourselves. We were told to choose any format to present our projects and allowed to present it on any topic as long as it related to science. As the deadline for the project drew near many students talked about how they had not completed the project because they lacked direction. As a result many students received bad grades and teachers struggled to grade individual projects on the same scale due to varying formats and topics. Many schools are questioning whether summer assignments should be designed by students or teachers. Mandatory summer projects shouldÂ be designed by teachers to guarantee that students have a clear understanding of requirements and continue to learn over the break.\n \n Educators best understand the curriculum students need to keep up with. In the majority of schools different departments are run by teachers working together to design the courses. If summer projects are designed by the same teachers then schools can ensure that the assignments will help students prepare for upcoming classes.\n \n Additionally, these projects can give a general idea of how the class will be taught and how difficult the course will be. This way students can get a head start on the material and have a complete understanding of what will be required.\n \n When designing tasks teachers can ensure that students are given enough work to learn. Over the summer of my freshman year I was given a project where students were allowed to choose which book they read and write a report on it. Many students chose short novels and finished their assignments in only a day. This caused any potential learning to be lost as students mostly forgot about the assignment after completing it. Projects designed by teachers can ensure that students do enough work over their break to continue learning outside of school and that the work matches the level of the class.\n \n Teachers can give additional support and instruction on assignments they designed. When projects are created by students teachers may struggle to help them with questions they may have. In the English department at my school teachers all work together to design large projects so that anyone in the department can answer questions and help students. This leads to a better understanding among students but still allows them to create unique and individual products that promote growth.\n \n Projects assigned over long breaks should be designed by teachers because teachers can better understand the curriculum, ensure that students learn, and provide additional support on assignments. In the future more assignments could be created that allow students to get a glimpse at upcoming material. Long breaks that often cause students to lose touch with the rhythm of school can be turned into opportunities to prepare. We should all encourage the furthering of our education by demanding that schools around us help students learn over break and require teachers to design summer projects for students.Â  Â Â Â",

    ESSAY:
      "During the summer, students across the world are given a break from school and the stress it entails. Although I believe summer break is an important thing for students, it can also be harmful educationally. This is because when students take extended breaks from their regular education, they often tend to forget things regarding their previous curriculum, and this break can also make it emotionally harder for students to return to school at the end of their summer break. Schools who require their students to complete summer projects have proved higher scores in student testing and graduation rates. I believe that these projects should be teacher-designed rather than student-designed. This is because teacher-designed summer projects would be more specific to curriculum, more educational, and more effective regarding preparation for the start of the school year, opposed to student-designed projects.\n \n To begin, I believe that teacher-designed projects would be more specific to curriculum opposed to student-designed projects. This is because teachers have further knowlege of upcomming curriculum while students do not. Therefore, the teacher-designed projects would be more hlepful in preparing a student for his or her upcoming classes. For example, if a teacher were to design a history project for a rising senior taking government for their next history class, the project would likely be based on a summary or unit in the students upocoming class. This project would be a simple way of preparing this student for their upcoming class and the curriculum it involves. If the student had designed the project themself, it may be on the wrong materal or may not be focused on important information they'll need during their upcoming school year. Although it is important to gain a basis of all knowledge, the more specific infomation a teacher would be able to demonstrate would be far more effective and helpful for a student in the long run.\n \n Secondly, I believe that teacher-designed projects would be far more educational than student-designed projects during the summer. This is because teachers have previously attended college and have earned degrees to professionally provide education to students. As experts in this field, a teacher would likely include more useful and informative information on a summer project, thus making the project far more effective. If a student were to design a project this could result in an activity that is not nearly as educational, helpful, and ultimately worth-while. If there are more educational benefits included in summer projects it can successfully provide an oppurtunity for students to learn and grow, while a student-designed project may lack this needed education which could result in a class being too challenging, stressful, and this student having an ultimately harder school life.\n \n Lastly, I strongly believe that teacher-designed projects would be far more effective regarding preparation for the start of a students school year. Teachers are aware of the details included in certain classes, and they have knowlege of a lot more information about these courses than a student would. Although a student may effectively design a summer project based on previoulsy taken classes, I believe education can only be expanded through gaining more knowledge regarding future classes, and these projects would likely be more effective if they were focused more toward a student's upcoming schooling rather than their previous education. This would allow the student to be effectively prepared and ready for the new school year, and possibly more prepared for some challenging courses they may end up taking in thier future, whether that is in grade school or earning a more advance degree. Not only would the teacher-designed project prepare them further, but it could also effectively make their next school year less stressful and more comprehendable. The teacher-designed project would not only prepare them for future education, but it could also prepare them for real-world struggles. For example, if a teacher-designed project ends up being challenging and stressful for a student, it will act as many real-life struggles. If this student were able to put hard work into completing this project, not only will they be further prepared educationally, but it could have the ability of showing them that life has challenges that may seem difficult but are never impossible.\n \n As time passes and problems are thrown at us, it seems as though young people are the one's with problem-solving ideas, and although I strongly stand by the idea of children and young people progressing our world, it is important that these students inquire the proper education to do so. That is why I believe that teacher-designed summer projects would be immensely more effective than student-designed projects during the summer. If students are able to complete these teacher-designed summer projects it could make their schooling more effective, thus producing future societal contributors. These teacher-designed projects could be a driving force in creating a problem solving adult who in the longrun could change the future of our fast-paced world and its many obstacles.",

      "Summer projects are often assigned to students to ensure learning continues over the summer. They help keep students' hands moving and gears turning. Projects are typically designed by teachers, however, when made by students the work load is easier to handle and is best fitted to each, individual student. Teachers can't always make classwork fun and engaging. By having a student make their own project, it takes the work load off the teacher and gives the student work they will enjoy doing. Additionally, most projects made by teachers have the same structure, therefore, it would be easier for students to cheat. Lack of supervision and a surplus of free time can lead to unwantedÂ collaborations.\n \n Everyone knows students dislike school, It has loud teachers and bone numbing A/C. Students are constantly falling asleep in class, not listening, and avoiding work. Being assigned a project over their sunny Summer break must be a bummer, right? That's what most people think, but assigning work that students have more liberty over can give them the upper-hand. They can choose a project that they have the supplies for, set it so it doesn't take much effort or time, and not to mention, they can be creative! They get an opportunity to explore something they're passionate about. And when a student is passionate about something, they make sure everyone knows.\n \n Projects take up time. In the Summer, time is in excess. Giving out a project makes sure they always have something to do. Students loose a lot over their break, they come back to school perplexed at a simple math problem. Take Generic_Name into example, she's an A-B student but every summer she looses what she learned that school year and it takes a few weeks for her to get back on track. Usually her first report card has C's and even D's. But one summer in 10th grade she was assigned two projects and her first report card in 11th grade had ALL A's! She was way ahead of the class and felt more confident when completing her assignments. Practice is key to gaining knowledge. With students tongue tied, Summer projects help turn their question marks into exclamation points!\n \n The teacher may also get a better understanding of his/her students. They get to see what they like, what inspires them, what makes them mad, what makes them said or what they have strong opinions on. It makes it easier to relate to a generation that seems illegible on the exterior. Kids can be confusing, especially with the professional relationship of teachers and students. They can't be as personal with their students, even then, there's too many to even try!\n \n Student-made projects give teachers an easy window into their individuality. Future projects may also improve and become better suited to the audience. Complaints about the complexity or disappointment of their assignment will disappear. And, yet again, the work load that is removed. No more stressing about what they should learn, just some simple guidelines and grading rubric. They could even make their own!\n \n Teachers put a lot of effort into their job, some would say the most out of any job. Their own money and heart is put into their work. They buy students supplies and are even are taught as if they were the teacher's own! There will always be that one kid that wants to show off and ends up biting off more than he can chew. Teachers give great structure by making it themselves. Projects are also easier to grade because they would all have the same structure. Summer projects can be a great way to keep minds growing over that long break, it just depends on the situation as to who should create the project.",

Why? because it's their summer and if it's a boring project that a teacher assigned it's most likely not going to get done , because it don't catch the student interest if the student design their own project they created it's most likely to get done because it's something that he/she likes.\n \n Teacher design might not be what the students are interested in , and they might not understand it. If the student creates their design it could be fun and easy for them, and they will be learning from it as well, and they will understand it more because they are make whatever out of it. They could do it in their own way which will also make them determine to complete their own design they created.\n \n Students design could also help the teachers too , they wouldn't have to do much planning cause the students have to come up with their own designs so the students have to come out with ideas on their own. The students will be engaged because they have to focus on what they will come up with for their design for this summer project also the enjoyment they would get out for creating their own design project. The students will be learning it in their own way that's not boring to them. That way it will keep them motivated and interested while they are working on their project.\n \n Student's should have a right to do something that would be entertaining to them since it's the summer and they have to work on it so they can continue to learn.

      "Work over the summer sounds boring enough, it creates less time to have fun over the summer break. However, what if it was the students to design the summer project, that can be based on a interest, a hobby, or an activity. In addition, if this was a possibility, creativity can shine on a student project, and a sense of pride upon working, so while doing work, student can enjoy of what they enjoy, share their ideas and passion. While others believe, that teacher should designed the summer projects; However, if the summer project was a student design, it'll benefits students and gives freedom to work on what they are interested.\n \n If were to be students designing a summer project for school, it brings out the creativity and how its unique from comparing other student's projects. Also, this summer project can spark a students passion or ideas to share, and create a voice for themselves. Moreover, student designed project, can cause less vulnerability of copying others projects, it creates a space where everyone is unique in their own way. I've done this project similar to the summer project, but mine wasn't in the summer, this was an annual thing where students share their ideas or passion in the criteria of being a creative and critical thinking, communication, etc. The project was a student based work, this benefited everyone to become unique and show your ideas to be a being collaborator, or communicator. Their were many different projects and many different voices spread across the school, it made me to feel that being different is great and striving for the passion is a key to owning success. I had fun doing this project, it gave me more freedom, it made me connect to more people who has same passion and ideas as I did. If the summer project was a student design project, it can help people spread their passion.\n \n From the project, there was not a lot of commitmentÂ for sharing ideas. ProcrastinationÂ happens a lot, student can pretend to work on it because they are afraid that it will take to long, or worked on it poorly just for a good grade. Also, how would the grading system work on the summer project, how can a teacher grade on a student of their ideas. Moreover, a teacher designed project would set standards of the project and can help students complete it, and it can be easy to know the rules of making the project. When I was preparing my project, I saw many student did their work but with low quality work, their wasn't a lot ofÂ encouragementÂ to the students project. There should be requirements on the summer project, to make rules that are not strict, but can set and help students to regulate their project.\n \n In conclusion, student designed project should be the main design, it helps student bring out their creative side and share ideas. Although, this can lead into lazy work, to no work at all, or no encouragement among students. Setting regulations and rules toward the project, can help to set up thier ideas or passion to share.Â",

      "When it's summer it basically means freedom for all kids. But there are some schools who do give their kids summer projects for them to do so they still lean during their break and they are all teacher designed. Students should be able to design their own projects because they can make time to work and pick their own deadlines, make their own instructions for them to understand, and how they learn by themselves.\n \n Students should be able to make time for their projects and pick their own deadlines. When you are assigned a project at school; the teacher picks the time for you to be able to work on your project. But there are times were these picked times affect students other life. Some may already have plans to do something whether it's going on a trip or just hanging out with friends, and family. And it's sorta ruined because now they have to stress on finishing a project during their plans. And a thing to avoid students from getting is stress. During the school year kids already have enough stress to deal with because they are given a lot work to do and only have a certain amount of time to finish their assignments. Lets not have students stress during their long break which they deserve. By allowing them to pick their time to work, and picking their deadlines; it'll eliminate the stress, and they can have their fun without it getting ruined.\n \n Teacher when they assign projects; they get to make the instructions on how to do the assignment. Sometimes the instructions are clear for some students, but for the others it isn't. Students are always told to ask their teachers if they have any questions or don't understand the assignment. But for some students, asking questions and trying to understand what to do still isn't clear for them, and they go ahead and try to figure it out themselves doing more work and once again giving them stress; only to find out they did it wrong. By allowing them to make their own instructions, it'll be clear for them to understand and they won't have to go through a lot of hard work to figure out what to do. Students already know what they need to know, and by making them do something they don't know at all, won't help them at all in the future. And they don't want to learn something they didn't know during the school year and now they have to learn it during there break.\n \n A teachers goal is to teach their students as well as possible, and hope that what they taught their student; they continue to still use it in their future. Allowing students to make their own assignments can show what they have learned from their teachers. It can help the teachers show what they need to teach future students and it shows that they are doing a good job to students education. And it'll show how well they can work on their own with the knowledge they have acquired, and with their creative mind they can come up with amazing things.. Teachers want to see one of their students as a leader; and by giving them the chance to make their own projects, is giving the current leader hope that their student can carry the touch for others. And during the summer they can learn more on their own which is what the teachers want: and show huge improvements to their learning.\n \n Students should be able to make their own assignments because they can make the time to do their work, can make their own instructions, and show what they have learned. Teachers ever year are teaching the new generation what they need to know and how to do it. They should let their students design their own assignments because it'll be a huge benefit for them, and as well a huge one to teachers. These students can come up with amazing projects that may lead to teachers using their projects to be assigned to other students. And to the teachers reading this, let us have a chance to do it.Â",

      "Projects over the summer? Seems unreal to adults, but the students are the ones who have to complete the project. All of the projects are normally teacher designed and are made to challenge the students, which benefits the students in the long run. If a student, or body of students was to design the project that the entire school would have to complete, it would most likely be too easy and would be completed in a matter of a week or two. These students also have no experience in designing a project, as the teachers do this for a living, so having a student design it, the project would be much too easy and would make no sense at all. So, teachers should always be the ones who design summer projects for the high school students.\n \n If students designed a project that they were supposed to complete, they would make it too easy. Why would a student(s) design a project that they have to complete at some point throughout the summer, and make it insanely hard for themselves and other students? In fact, they would not, they would make the project or assignment simple and short for ease of completion. When a student goes on break he or she will not want to do anything but have fun, and by having a project this would eliminate part of the fun. So, if a student designed it, they would make it work not only around their schedule, but also around their free time in order to have the most fun during break. If a teacher was to create the project, it would be long, hard, and complicated in order to make the students think and keep their brain working over the entirety of summer break. Which leads me to my next point, why have a student do it, when a teacher gets paid to do it, and do it well?\n \n When a teacher has been creating material for students to do for his or her entire life, why switch to students to create this work? Well, we should not, having students create their own assignments would be pointless, as they have teachers to do it and assign the project to them for a living. Teachers know much more than students when it comes to designing any sort of work that gets assigned to the students. When a student designs an assignment it also adds even more work for them to do as well as more stress for the students, which can add up as time goes on, as there is only so much work a student canÂ do at once. Teachers are also much better at designing projects that fit everyone in the class as the teacher knows how most people learn and how they learn the best, whether that be though working hands on, via audio, or visual learning. The teacher will always produce a better project, which is why teachers should stay making the assignments and students should continue to complete them without complaining. Also, would students not attempt to post-pone the completion of the design in order to cancel it altogether.\n \n Via post-poning the entire design of the project, students would think that this would cancel the entirety of the project, which is false. This is another advantage of having a teacher design the project, he or she would most likely get the project designed and handed out to the students in a timely manor. This is something that most of the students would not be able to do, so having a student design it is not the best option. There could also be many setbacks and distractions for the students, like phones, jobs, friends, etc. All of these are examples of distractions that could set the project design back a lot. Although teachers could have the same problems, they are much more mature and know how to deal with the distractions as well as get work done at the same time. These are all reasons that the teachers would get the project designed in a more timely manor than the students.\n \n Finally students would not be the best option for designing these summer projects because students would try to make it too easy, post pone the project design, as well as teachers get paid for this as it is their job. So, students would slack off and get little to no work done due to distractions, and clever ways to get out of designing and completing the project. So teachers should stay designing the project and this should not change for good reason as well.",

This break given is a moderate period of time given to students and teachers throughoutÂ the hottest months of the year. Many children spend this time with their friends and family, some even take the opportunity to get a summer job. However some schools feel it is necessary to give their students an excessive amount of school work to do complete the summer. Many of these summer assignments are from classes including Math, English, and even some AP classes. Most summer assignments given do not provide an explanation of how to complete it, which leaves many students clueless and with no desire to complete their task. Students should be provide to pick an assignment that appeals most to them, in order to give them a drive to complete the work.\n \n Summer break is supposed to be enjoyable days away from school with no stress. Giving these students school work over their times off is not fair to them nor is it fair to the teachers. When this work is given, large amounts of students choose not to complete it; or they chose to complete it but not with the best of their abilities. Most summer assignments that are given are not beneficial to the student when they return to school. In fact, many teachers do not discuss the summer assignment with the students and some have even chose to not put in the grade because many of their students did not complete it, which is not fair to the students that took the time out of their summer to complete it. With summer assignments being mandatory, students should be able to choose their assignments based on the classes they will be taking, in order to make their summer a little more enjoyable. No student wants to complete an assignment they have no interest in.\n \n Almost all teachers a facultyÂ spend their summer days off relaxing with their families and enjoying their time off, as they should. However they do not grade nor complete assignments for the students. Yes toward the end of the summer teachers have to go back to school earlier than their students to ensure their rooms are set up, cleaned, and ready for the children to return. School faculty also have to attend a few meetings together to make sure the upcoming school year will go smoothly. If students apply their summer time to the assignments the teachers should also apply their time to explaining the assignments throughly before their vaction.\n \n A class that students need to have in order to continue learning over the summer, is math. Math is a subject that people use everyday. The assignments math teachers give should provide helpful ways for the student to learn and complete the assignment if it is something they may not know how to do. Most students do complete their summer assignments before summer break, which means they can ask for help from teachers around them. However some wait until they have down time to complete these assignments which causes them to forget how to complete it. All assignments that are given should give the student a clear understanding of how the teacher may want it to be completed, with an example to help assist the student for when the teacher is not around.\n \n If the summer assignment that is assigned does not benefit the student and will not be brought up or discussed after they turn it in, it should not be given for them to complete on their days off. The assignments teachers assign are usually not enjoyable and take large periods of time to complete. IfÂ assignmentsÂ must be given over the summer, students should have a choice from a variety of assignments to choose from; such as a power pointÂ on somewhere historical they could have visited over the summer or even reading a chosen book the class will read together during theÂ upcomingÂ school year\n \n Students should not have to take time out of their days off the complete an assignment that will not help them in the up coming school year. Many students find summer assignments boting and unenjoyable, which is why they choose to not complete them.

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue their learning during the break. Every individual at some point in their life has had to make a project of their own. Whether it be a project at school or a project at home for themselves to enjoy. So when it comes to these summer projects, they should be student-designed because an individual has more freedom to choose a topic of their own, they are less restrictive, and students can use their best strengths to make a project that is less stressful for them.\n \n A student has more freedom when choosing a topic of their own with a student-designed project. For instance, a lot of the projects in school are tied to a specific topic. When it comes to choosing the type of project, at a first glance, there may seem like there is a lot to choose from. But in reality, this is just the illusion of choice. There isn't a lotÂ of room for creativity and imagination, therefore there isn't much freedom. Many individuals will agree that with more freedom, they have the liberties and creativity to come up with something that is unique. Others may argue that with more freedom, a student might not stick to what they what they are supposed to learn, But that is far from the truth. It is the opposite, students are more restricted when they are forced to create a project with a topic they are not the best at, which leads to the next point.\n \n Student-designed projects are less restrictive. For instance, much of the work we are assigned in school is teacher-designed. From personal experience, when a project is teacher-designed, a lot of the work can be mediocre, as apposed to a project that is student-designed. When students aren't allowed to come up with their own ideas, their imagination is bound and restricted. Some teachers may argue that it doesn't matter that students are restricted, all that matters is that a student gets the work done, but that is not correct. The student wont be as motivated and will turn in a project that is has no effort, therefore getting a lower grade.\n \n individuals can use their best strengths to make a project that is less stressful for them with student-designed projects. A project can seem like a large and outstanding task to finish for a large amount of students, and as a result, puts stress on an individual. A student-designed project can relieve plenty of this stress, as students can choose a subject that they are best at. It is easier for someone as they are more comfortable with a topic they are more knowledgeable with. Other individuals may argue that students should make an effort to choose a subject they aren't familiar with, but many can disagree because choosing a topic someone isn't familiar with puts more stress on a person and can lead to them struggling to learn.\n \n Summer projects help students learn during the break, but students should ultimately decide on designing their own projects for individuals to continue to learn. At the end of the day, they should have the freedom to enjoy doing what they are best at they shouldnt be stressed over work they aren't comfortable with in the summer.Â  Â Â Â Â Â",

And the outcome of the summer project would look stunning.\n \n Finally,when given the project from the teacher it may come to a surpriseÂ that some students may not be interested into that one subject or topic that they are learning,so they would lose interestÂ in the whole project and not put effort into it. But if it is for a topic or subject that they are interested in and that they can choose the teacher would fully capture their interest and the student may put effort into the project. And if they know so much about that one thing then you are sure going to see a lotÂ of things down on that project.\n \n One can argue that this is not a good idea for students on choosing their project one reason one could say is that it may lack focusÂ ,that this curtain thing wont help them in life, and that they need to know more important things in school so that is why teachers would assign these projects for the teacher to know the understandings of their students.\n \n So in conclusion, student designed projects would very much benefit them. In ways that they can actually know what topic or subject they are doing,it can show one students creativity,and the students may be really interested in the project that they are doing. And this can help them do more well in school due to that one summer project.",

    ESSAY:
      "Its that time of year where students have to complete a summer project. These projects are a way of making sure that the students are learning and being productive throughout their summer vacation. Students best know their own interests, so, summer projects should be student-designed because it ensures that students will be engaged, leads to completion of the project, and promotes the continuation of their interests.\n \n Although, some people may think that student-designed summer projects are not the best way to have students continue their education. For the reasons of it leads to researching non-important topics or results in students not taking the project seriously. This point of view makes sense because if the projects are teacher-designed it would ensure that all students are learning about something important and valuable to their education. However, this point of view is wrong because the definition of an important topic is different to everyone. Students will do the summer project on something of importance or value to them because they have the option to make it something or their own and make it unique.\n \n Students will always become engaged in a topic if the have the freedom to choose it. While students are getting ready to choose what they want to do during the summer they will become interested about the topic they choose. This will make sure that students are kept interested throughoutÂ the summer to produce something that they are proud of. For example, a students favorite animal is a panda and he or she wants to research, visit museums, visit libraries, and visit the zoo to learn more about them and be able to come up with a good project. This student is eager to learn about something he or she loves and is passionate about. This project will keep this student fully engaged through the summer learning about the panda. All students have something that they are interested in and if they choose a topic and create a project it may even open and door to a passion they were not aware of.\n \n In addition, the completion of the student-designed summer project is critical to their learning because without the completion of it students will not get the full experience of learning what they picked on their project. If students are allowed to design their own projects the teachers will not have to worry about a students not completing the project because they became uninterested or bored. Students will be eager to complete their projects and that is all a teacher could want is to have a student eager about a project and then complete it because they wanted to not because they were forced to. For example a student is given the topic of rocks and the student has never had an interest in this. The student will struggle because they have no interest in researching rocks. This student will most likely not complete the project or will do it in the last week of summer. This prevents students of having a valuable learning experience with something that they like.\n \n As well as students having a variety of interests, if the summer projects are student-designed they could explore an area of interest that they are already familiar with and dive in deep to what they like. This could help a student find out more information on a topic they think they may like or already know that they have a passion for. For example, if a student is interested in medicine and they want to become a doctor why would they need to research rocks? This student will have the time to research what she wants to do with her future while also completing her schools requirement. It is a great thing for a young student to already be setting their mind into what they will like to do in their future and researching it.\n \n Summer learning projects should be student-designed because it help ensure that students will be engaged, leads to project completion, and allows for the continuation of personal interests. Students need to have a time to be able to research and make a project on a topic that they enjoy learning about and what better time than the summer to do that. Young students are the future, so, the schools should permit student-designed summer projects to have the students better understand the topic of their choice. The next time students have to do summer project they should be allowed to designÂ it and stride for their best educational experience.Â  Â Â Â",

      "Summer Projects\n \n Summer break is a students favorite time of year. It is a vacation from school, five days a week, for three months. The only exception to this is a summer project. Teachers assign summer projects to their upcoming classes, so when school starts again they have not forgotten everything they previously learned and are prepared for what the new school year has in store. Although some people can argue that students should be given options for their summer assignments, it is best to leave that job to the professionals because they are the ones trying to refresh, prepare, and teach students. Even if the teacher does pick the topic, that does not mean students cannot be creative and think outside the box.\n \n If students got to pick their own topics, maybe they would feel inspired and put in more effort, but it is more likely that they would do something easy they already know about. The whole point of a summer project is to keep their brain refreshed over the summer. For example, if your teacher asked you to read any book and write a report on it, it would be easy to pick a book you have already read or even Google a summary of a random book, but if your teacher picked the book, then you would read a book you probably have not read and actually learn something new.Â Copying down what you find online or using a book you read two years ago will not help you grow academically or refresh your mind.\n \n The whole point of a summer project is to keep their brain refreshed over the summer. Since teachers already know the curriculum, before the year even starts, a simple summer project is perfect to keep their brain active while familiarizing them with new material. Even just writing a short poem inspired by the Romanticism Era with an analysis is a good way to introduce a subject they might not know a lot about. Summer projects do not have to be hard or long, just enough to give a preview of what they will be learning. A specific topic also allows a more detailed rubric because it tells you exactly what to do, whereas if everyone picked, the rubric would not be specific or very helpful.\n \n Teachers can pick the topic of a summer assignment without taking the individuality out. If the teacher picks a topic, it is obviously something they know about already. Teachers picking the assignment also reduces confusion and encourages student collaboration to talk to each other about the task to better understand. Any project you get regardless of it being during the summer or the school is meant to prepare you for the future. High school is all about preparing you, whether that is something as small as starting a new school year to going to college.\n \n Every single thing you do in life can teach you something. That is why teachers are so important because they get paid to teach students, like me. Even if it seems pointless, it is important to still do it because in the end, just completing the task shows perseveranceÂ and teaches students not to procrastinate. Nobody would hand out projects for fun. All assignments are to benefit their students in the long run. It is also important to try to have fun while doing school work because if your mind is open to new things, you might like what you are learning. Getting assigned a topic is not meant to put you in a box, it is meant to give a topic to explore.\n \n We should leave the teaching to the teachers. Let them decide the best way to teach us because that is what they are here for. If they want us to really understand their lessons, they should pick the assignments to ensure they get the results they desire. Teachers went to school to learn the best methods of teaching, so we should trust them to refresh, prepare, and teach students everything they need to know.",

      "Summer Projects for school should be Teacher-designed because it will show students the expectations for the course, helps them learn the specific material that is needed, and keeps students on track. The main part of summer projects is to assure that students continue their learning process. While schools have long breaks at a time, it is difficult to come back and still remember all of the things that was taught before being let out for a long amount of time. Teachers and student both struggle to jump back into the schedule of going to school each day. Many students have a hard time maintaining everything after being a way and not looking at the material for a while. Some schools require students to complete assignments or projects during a long period break to maintain their learning abilities, but if students are not given the right objective, then they are bound to not learn anything. There are many examples on why summer projects should be teacher-designed.\n \n First, students need expectations and requirements for school projects because it shows them what the teacher will be looking for while grading. This can relate back to whenever a teacher is gone for a period of time or is absent for the day and tells the students what is expected of them while the teacher is away. Having expectations and requirements for a project makes sure that the student puts in effort and that the assignment is detailed with the right topics. While students are working on an assignment, and ESSAY, or a project, they do tend to lead their way off topic and start to write about unnecessary details. Having a list or a checklist of things that are expected of each student helps them know what needs to be on it and it is easier to follow.\n \n Most students have said that they prefer checklist and requirements than anything else because it is helpful to check off instructions and make sure that everything that is needed is on the assignment.\n \n Next, having students keep the learning process going during the summer with help their growing minds, but if they are not given the right topics and material then they will be confused and would have not learned a single new thing. With projects, students are suppose to make the assignment talk and discuss a main point of a topic. Teachers usually make projects as specific as possible, if the student was told to do it themselves then it would be easy for them to not go into detail and specifics about anything. In school, most topics have a huge variety of smaller details and information that would not be a main point in assignments and projects. Students would have to follow what the teacher wants to make sure that they do not write down the wrong information. Most of the time, when a teacher designs a project, they usually give a variety of tools and websites to go to if they need more information on something. Those websites and tools will give the specific examples and info on what the topic is based on and it will help the students have a better knowledge of the main point.\n \n Lastly, after focusing on one main topic for a long time, students tend to get bored and not try as hard as they should. Some students have a hard time staying on track while doing something school related on their own, they usually need some guidance to follow and go by. If summer projects were student-designed, the students would not be able to follow what they need to do and would not have any rules to go by. Different students have different ways of learning, some like to do hands on activities or web questsÂ to learn, others just prefer to write down everything that they learn as notes. A teacher-designed project can give different ways of portraying the material. A teacher-designed project will also make students be on time with the assignment. If a teacher assigns a summer project, they will most likely attach when specific things are due at what time, for example: the ESSAY portion will be due in 2 weeks, the rough draft is due in 1 week, the poster with the end result is due the first day of school. Most big projects that take a while to finish will have smaller tasks to finish throughout of period before it is due. Teachers can tell if students are on the right track if they assign things during the process of working on the project.\n \n In other words, having a student designed summer project is not a great idea. If students made the project by themselves, the teacher could become confused while trying to figure out the main topic. Students would not follow any sort of guideline unless a teacher attaches it to the assignment. If the project was not designed by a teacher, then the student making it would not be great with knowing when to put deadlines and they would not be sure with what to put on the project. The summer project will most likely be done much sooner because made it clear when things will be due. If it was made by a student, they will more likely slack off and be lazy with portraying the assignment. A teacher-designed summer project would be the most efficient way to stay on track with deadlines, to know what to talk about or not, and it shows the requirements and expectations that the teacher wants to see.

    ESSAY:
      "As the school year comes to an end, the school halls are filled with students' conversing about their summer plans, an the joys of the school year being over. However, for many students, school isn't nearly over. Some schools task their students with summer projects to ensure that students keep learning outside of the school year. Ultimately, it is questioned whether the project should be teacher-designed, or student-designed. When a student is given the power to design their own project, it allows the student to grow mentally and help broaden their learning horizons. This allows students to base their project on something that they are heavily interested in, others might even venture beyond what they are already familiar with, and lastly it motivates them to complete their assignment with passion.\n \n It is very often that when a student is told they must complete a project based off a topic that they aren't interested in, their initial thought may be that the project will be boring and difficult. However, when they are allowed to chose their topic, it is very likely that their perspective might change into a more positive point of view. When picking topics for a project, most students are inclined to base it on something that they have a liking for. When I was in middle school, I was part of a program called the\n \n Gifted and Talented, this program was centered on both, group and individual projects. We had been assigned a project in honor of Earth Day and due to my immense love and interest for marine life, I had decided on creating a vessel that would roam the ocean and detect any trash that had been tossed into the water, and collect it. After I had researched where most ocean trash was found, I had decided that this vessel would remain near beaches and ports. If the teacher had designed the project and told us that we had to create something on a specific topic such as, prevention of forest fires, there could have been a chance that I hadn't been as enthused and wouldn't have tried as much.Â Not only did this project help me think outside the box, but it also helped me decide on my future career by allowing me to research more on a topic that I was interested in.\n \n Furthermore, instead of sticking with something familiar, students might try and explore other topics in which they lack knowledge. By learning about different subjects, one is able to broaden their educational horizons, which may come in handy later on in life. I once new a woman who arrived at college \"undecided\". She was unsure of what to major in, and she was later told that she needed to complete a project in a subject of her choosingÂ by the end of the year. Soon after the news, she realized that she needed to decide on a project fast, so she decided she would join her parish during one of their visits to a poor community out of town. She had no knowledge of how to help the people in the community, but she believed that she would be able to both accomplish her project, and make an impact on these people's lives. Her project was then completed after she spent her summer building ramps, cooking meals, and painting murals for that community. Soon after her project was completed, she decided that she would major in Social Services, because making an impact in people's lives and helping them achieve a better life was something she would want to do as a career.\n \n By being able to choose her project, she was able to broaden all of her horizons and grow as a person as well as mentally mature through her experiences. Once again, if there had been restrictions on that project and it was no longer on a topic of her choosing, but instead she had to complete a paper on politics, she could've spent a couple more years undecided, or she could've dropped out of college.\n \n Lastly, when students are allowed to design their own projects, they not only take their time to complete their project, but they pay attention to every last detail, and make sure that everything is done to their liking. It can be said that some of these projects are the result of passion. For example, during my Sophomore year in high school, I was assigned a project based off a genocide of my choosing. OriginallyÂ I thought I would do this project on the Rwandan genocide, but thought better of it since I was already familiar with it. In the end, I decided on the Cambodian Genocide and decided I would be doing a scrapbook for the execution of the project. At first the research was a bit slow since I was unfamiliar with the topic, but as I learned more about the subject, I found a passion for the project I didn't know I had. I began working on the scrapbook everyday after school over the course of a month. By the time the deadline had come, the project had been completed and was ready to be displayed on Genocide Night. In the end, I was able to score a high grade, and even used my research for a project assigned for my art class a year later.\n \n All in all, student designed projects are beneficial for the student as it gives them the opportunity to increase their knowledge in a variety of topics as well as help them mentally mature. When given the choice to infinite possibilities, there is plenty of space for infinite success. Teacher designed projects, more often than not, are usually seen as boring, time consuming tasks, because they are created by someone that doesn't have a students interests in mind. Projects assigned during the school year are solely based on the topic they are learning, or book they are reading in class. However, summer projects should not have that restriction despite the project's purpose of making sure that students are learning. Students should be allowed to take the reigns on their projects, and lead them in the direction that they want to go in. When students are given the freedom of choosing, they are more inclined to learn and retain that information, then when they are forced to learn about things they could care less about.Â",

    ESSAY:
      "Summer is a time for student to have a long deserved break from school. During this time, however, some students become unable to no longer retain their knowledge and have to recover prior knowledge starting the next school year. To compensate, some schools assign summer projects for the students to be proactively accomplishing. Whether it be a project that they get to design or a teacher designs for them. The main argument here is \"what is better\" for the learning experience of the student. A project created and designed by a student over the summer is better than a teacher designed one because the project will be more engaging for the student, the student will have full control, and the student will have easier time learning or their own accord.\n \n A student who designs their own summer project will have a engaging experience with their project. As a student, the ability for a project to be fun to do and still be a good learning experience is number one. Having your own project to do gives you the sense that you know what you're capable of accomplishing. It will be engaging because student will get to interact in their own methods and ways. Learning in this way helps students to retain information and maybe learn about something they may have never thought about. An engaging project made by the students will also give the students a means of commitment to do the project if it is fun to do and is beneficial for them academically. Engagement in a project is the best way for a students to want to be able to drive their passion in learning forward, without the hassle of abiding by the teacher's rules and regulation of the project. Giving students the right to build their own project makes the learning part fun and engaging for the students, which will overall provide them with possibly of better academic achievement and retention.\n \n Students with full control their project will be able to make it a project they will be proud of. Full control means that students will be able to go though the steps of conception, planning/design, making/prototyping, and possibly revision on their own. Giving students the leveraging control, builds the sense that they understand the topic the most and that they should be able to complete the project under their own goals and ideas. This helps to build skills in learning and retaining information taught. With full control, they will also have the necessary time to complete their project on their own without the overlooking burden of a teacher telling them what to do exactly. This removes the unnecessary stress of designing a project to meet someone else's goals and hoping that it will meet their specifications. A student, given this freedom of choice and design, will be able to learn more about something that they enjoy learning about, it makes the overall experience better for them and also builds their design processes to be better efficientÂ and less costly to them. These skills learned from being in full control of a major project can be used in schools and possibly be used later in the workplace or any other setting that puts them under control of a project.\n \n The last argument is that students will have an easier time of learning when they get to make it. Without the teacher being in the way, not only will the student be hopefully, less stressed, but also put them in charge of learning. Being able to self pace yourself, will help to slowly build up information into your mind and retain that information for longer when you may have to use it one day in the near future. Without the regulations of an authoritative teacher, students build projects under their ideas. As long as the project is providing the student with educational content that they will learn from, they will be able to enjoy it, which removes the boring parts of learning about a certain subject and instead, make it fun to learn about and understand. Students building up the knowledge slowly by themselves, will slowly integrate the information into their mind slowly, without overwhelming students with complex research projects or projects dealing with hard to reach goals assigned by the teacher. A student who learns by themselves may be smarter and less worried by the goals of a project than a student who has to follow the rules and regulations word for word from the teacher. Students that get to design the projects themselves will overall have an easier time understanding and learning.\n \n A couple of main arguments that may arise when students get to make their own summer projects is that they may not be learning about what they should be learning about or the project is not regulated enough itself to provide any academic goals. Or, a student may make a project that is overall not fitted for any academic setting. For the most part, if students are just given maybe one or two rules stating that it must be a project that someone can actually obtain information from and that the project is not just a simple little project. Then the need for a teacher to design a project for the students is effectively gone, since they would only have to follow the simple rule of not making it too easy on themselves and make a project that will help them excel academically.\n \n To wrap up, projects under the design of a student will be better than a teacher designed one because the students are better engaged in their own projects, the students will have full control of their project and everything that goes into it, and the students will have an easier time comprehending/learning at their own pace. Schools that assign summer projects know that the real intent is to help keep the students proactive in their studies over the summer break, and these projects are suppose to help them do so. Student designed projects will be a better option for schools since it gives the students choice in their education. And that profound statement, gives students a better chance at starting off the next school year with information ready to be used.Â",

      "As the school year comes to a close, countless students look forward to spending their days relaxing by the pool, going on vacation, and hanging out with their friends. For some, however, the beginning of summer break also means preparing for the next school year. Summer assignments are common among advanced high school classes, and are equally dreaded by most high school students. Moreover, teacher-designed projects do not spark much interest from those who must complete them. Schools that require students to complete summer projects should allow students to design their assignments because it promotes responsibility, keeps students interested, and provides more opportunities for students in school and in the future.\n \n When completing an assignment over the summer break, students are responsible for setting time aside in order to work and study. A good sense of responsibility is an essential part of designing a project and making sure it gets done. When crafting a project, students are responsible for creating their own ideas and implementing them correctly, in order to create an interactive and challenging assignment. Without good time management skills, a student may fall behind, leaving them with a sub par project, and most likely a disappointed teacher. Allowing a student to take the lead on designing a project will promote the necessary components of learning good time management. As well as time management, a student also learns how to balance priorities. Yes, summer is an amazing opportunity to have fun, but it also provides the means to be better prepared for the school year. When a student decides to prioritize a summer project over a video game or TV program, they set themselves up for future success in the form of a high grade. Focusing on one's priorities teaches them a great deal of responsibility, and can be applied to many different situations in the future. Allowing a student to design their own project teaches them how to effectively manage their time and understand their priorities, leading them to become more responsible.\n \n When a student learns or studies about something they are interested in, they are able to absorb more information. Letting a student design their own project will assist in a more powerful learning experience. If a student who was interested in trains received a project about frogs, chances are he/she would quickly become disinterested and bored. A student would perform far better on an assignment that their interests can be applied to. A student designed project promotes creativity, as well as sponsoring individuality. Moreover, it is almost impossible for a teacher to design a project that caters towards all the needs and interests of his/her students. A student-lead project would return higher grades and provide a way for a teacher to further understand each of her students, the way they learn, and their personal interests. This allows for a stronger relationship between a teacher and /his/her class, and creates a more beneficial learning environment. The decision to allow students to design their own projects will make for a more impactful, enjoyable, and interesting learning experience.\n \n Lastly, a student-designed project will provide more opportunity for students to expand their network, and discover what they want to study and achieve in the future. When working on a project or assignment that is based off the personal interests of an individual student, they could be inspired to study further into their chosen subject, and provide them with an idea of what they want in the future. A student who studies trains could soon realize that he/she is more interested in planes, and now wants to be a pilot. They could also be influenced to join a school club or get a job that pertains to their chosen subject. The ideas that they create when designing their own project can be applied to their goals for the future. As well as providing ideas for their career and future studies, they will also be able to expand their network of people who have the same aspirations as them. Designing a project allows for one to work with many different people, such as a partner or group, and offers the means to build new relationships and acquaintances. The idea of a student-designed summer project is more effective in expanding a student's knowledge of personal goals, and provides an environment with many opportunities to meet new people and discover new ideas.\n \n In conclusion, the benefits of a student-designed project are far greater than those of a teacher-designed project. Students learn new skills, such as responsibility and time management. They are also provided with opportunity to expand their knowledge, discover their interests, and discover themselves as an individual. The people they meet and work with throughout designing and completing a summer project will benefit them in school, further studies, and possibly even the work force. The idea of a student-designed project proves itself to be a more beneficial, rewarding, and fun experience.Â  Â Â Â Â",

      "Many schools across the country require students to complete summer assignments to assure that they continue their pursuit of knowledge even without a teacher present. But should these assignments be designed by the teacher or should they be designed by the student? If a student were given freedom with their project, it would be a lot more enjoyable rather than if a teacher put strict conditions on it. But a lack of strictness would mean that students are less likely to complete their project and they wouldn'tÂ know when the work they have done is enough. Teachers should put that restriction on the student and give them a specific assignment to ensure that the appropriate amount of work gets done.\n \n Students are less likely to complete a project that they have freedom on and if they do complete it, the quality would suffer greatly compared to if a teacher gave them a prompt or a specific task to accomplish. The point of a summer assignment is to prevent to student from losing knowledge or getting rusty because of a break. Although the point of the summer break is to let students relax until the next year starts, it's still important that they keep their studies up. Assignments shouldn'Â be student-designed because that would allow too much leisure and when school comes around, most students would not have it done. For example, I had two summer assignments last summer. One was for English and one was for Math. For the English one, the assignment was to read any book of my choosing and write a review about it. This assignment had very unclear instructions and I, the student, was supposed to add my own twist to it and complete the assignment however I wanted to. I started on the assignment, but never finished it because I didn't have the motive since there was no specific prompt to answer to, so I wrote a couple of sentences and called it quits. But for the Math assignment, I had a packet to complete of practice problems. The finish was in sight and crystal clear. I did it throughout the summer and finished it by August. The reassurance I felt that once I did a specific amount of work and followed the teacher's directions, I would be done is what encouraged me to finish. The English assignment was unclear and I didn't know how much to complete to make sure that I was on track for next year.\n \n Summer assignments are important for a student and the reason to have them teacher-designed is to give the student reassurance and to make sure the student doesn't do too much work over what's supposed to be a break, yet it keeps them on track. If an assignment is student-designed then the student will do one of three things: overwork themselves, not fully apply their capabilities, or not do the work at all. For these reasons, summer assignments should all be teacher-designed.",

      'Some schools that require students to complete summer projects to assure kids continue to learn over break is a smart idea. Yet, the question "Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student- designed?" Can determine if a student will enjoy and do the work that they are assigned. These projects should be student-designed because this will cause a higher percent of students to do the work, while enjoying the experience, students can learn about something that they want, and teachers will be able to learn about the new students coming to their class.\n \n There is always a problem with kids not doing their assigned work. Starting off the year with a incomplete project could ruin the year for some. If students were allowed to design the project, they would be choosing topics that they are likely to complete, and ones that they can enjoy. There is a direct correlation with kids who enjoy the topic they are learning about and completion rate of projects. Student-designed projects may lead to a higher percent of kids doing their work and less kids pushing off projects till the last minute. This can assure that kids will be learning the matirial over summer break.\n \n Projects don\'t always have to be strictly information that we cover in school, sometimes it is good to learn about something that interests the individual. With student-designed projects, students will have the freedom to chose what they want to learn about. Giving this opportunity to students will allow them to show their interests to teachers and their peers. Having kids focus on something they find interesting, increases their drive to learn new information, which will help them throughout the upcoming school year.\n \n Student-designed projects will not only benefit students, teachers will learn about new students as the school year starts. Having teachers learn about students can help build important teacher-student relationships. Teacher-student relationships are important to develop throughout the year, so students feel they have a safe place to go if they need help or if they have had a bad day. Many students tend to have hard times learning from teachers they dont respect, or like. Projects that are student-designed will increase the trust kids have in their teachers, as well as teachers about new students.\n \n While some teachers and school officials may not be in favor of student-designed projects because it could be hard to grade if the teacher does not know the topic being presented. Many people would argue that students should not be the only people learning new things. Teachers should be able to learn about topics the students are interested in to better the way they interact with students. Although, teachers might not be experts on these topics, grade should not be on the information, rather on the way the student presents the information and how they researched each topic.\n \n While the answer to teacher-designed projects or student-designed projects can be up for debate their are many reason to why a student-designed project are better than teacher-designed project. The level of completion, student interest, and allowing for better teacher-student relationship are all very important to assure that students will continue to learn over break.Â',

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. This helps them to keep their brain running. I believe that the students should get to design what project they want to do. Choosing their project will guarantee that they are focused while working on it, they will choose a topic that interests them, and their grade will result at a higher score.\n \n Allowing students to choose their projects will help keep them focused on it. For example, if a student likes things related to writing, they will enjoy working on it. They will give it all their effort and time. It also allows them to focus more on the topic itself. Being home will let also let them be comfortable working on their projects. They will not be distracted by any classmates. They will feel less pressured by their teachers to get things done. They will be able to pace themselves. And their hard work will be reflected in their projects.\n \n Students tend to get exited about a topic they are interested in. Giving them the freedom to do so will result in a better researched project. They will also be interested in similar things, so they will continue to research without them being told to do so. The quality of their project will be reflected by their interest in the topic they choose.\n \n Some people may believe that getting their research project assigned by a teacher is better. I disagree with this statement. Students will feel the pressure of getting the assignment done because a teacher told them to do so. Some may even do the project last minute because they were not interested in the topic. Or maybe they were not comfortable working on it. Their efforts to work on the project will be decreased, resulting in a much lower grade. If a student chooses the topic they want to work on, and the time they dedicate to working on it, they will get a higher score. It will assure that the students continue to learn during their break.\n \n In conclusion, a student-designed project will ensure they continue to learn over the break. They will get to enjoy their break and learn at the same time. A teacher-designed project will make them lose interest and effort. What would you prefer?Â",

    ESSAY:
      "Imagine you just finished your sophomore year of high school. Summer has finally arrived! The whole Summer is yours for you to do anything and everything you want to do... except for your Summer assignment. In one class, your teacher has assigned you to run a specific research project that encompasses all the main ideas of the subject. In another class, the teacher has given you the assignment of designing and completing your own project. You sit down and think. Which one of these projects will teach me the subject better? Summer project assignments should be designed by the teacher of the course's project since it would avoid students designing projects that are not challenging enough, teachers know the subject better, and they are trained to give the right assignments for effective teaching.\n \n First and foremost, high school students are known to avoid the heavier workload if given the choice of a lighter one, even if the heavier workload will benefit them in the long run. For example, I've had the experience of having a history class assign more work one year, and the next year's history class assign less. In the class with more projects and work given, I learned the material more thoroughly and can still apply the material I learned to other situations. On the other hand, I can't remember much of the material from the class that gave me less work and projects. Though I enjoyed the lighter class, I learned that more work is equivalent to a better understanding of the subject. This, therefore, means that students, with their preference for less work, would not benefit from designing their own project since they'd simply design a light and extremely easy project.\n \n Another reason why teachers should design Summer projects is that they know the subject they teach better than the students they are assigning the project to. Teachers, apart from having learned and gone through the same classes as the students they teach, have also gone to college and studied the subject in a lot more depth for years. They simply know more than the student and know what projects helped them, as students, learn the material. A chemistry teacher, for example, is going to know what project to give to students in order for the student to learn chemistry since the students haven't even taken the class yet. Students do not know what projects will teach them effectively.\n \n Additionally, teachers have gone through years of schooling and college to get to the position they are in, as well as probably having years of teaching experience. They have been trained to teach students effectively and know what methods of teaching work best. This also means that teachers know which projects and what approach to projects are best for students. In my science class one year I had the option of designing and running my own experiment. I chose the easiest option and ended up doing badly since there were no instructions or guidelines for the experiment. I did learn from my mistakes and having to teach myself the subjects related to the experiment, but the experiment was mostly a fiasco. I learned the subjects a lot better when my teacher gave us a project that had clear intentions and guidelines that guided us to the main lesson we were being taught rather than just a project of doing whatever thrown at us. Teacher usually knows best.\n \n After a few moments of thinking, you come to the conclusion that teacher-designed projects teach you better and more effectively. Yes, you as a student do know how you yourself learn better than a teacher knows how you specifically learn. Yes, students can also learn from the process and mistakes of designing a project, but the truth is that the likelihood of at least the majority of students putting the effort into their project to put these ideas into account is very low. Teachers know how to teach and what projects to give to students to effectively teach. Now, you sit down and start your projects.",

      "Over the summer, students forget a lot of what they learned during the previous year; some even have trouble writing after summer break. This is why some schools have projects over the summer, such as summer reading. These projects should be designed by teachers because the teachers know how to incorporate important aspects of the course that they are teaching into a project, and because the students don't know the material in the course as well as the teachers do.\n \n Teachers know how to introduce their students to new material, or prepare them to be introduced to new material; they are professionals at it. Many teachers have years of experience, or at the very least, they can go to another teacher in their department for help creating an idea for a project. Therefore, they should be able to curate a project that allows their upcoming students to be prepared for their class. While they may not be teaching new material with these projects, they are preparing their students for the rest of the year.\n \n Some may argue that students should create ideas for projects for their fellow students because they themselves are students, and know what would have helped them. However, their teachers know the material better, and have a better understanding of what they can do to ensure the success of their students. Many students don't even remember what they learned at the beginning of the year. If they don't remember what they learned at the beginning of the school year, they can't come up with ideas for a project to introduce them to that material. Students don't want to do homework during the summer. If they were tasked with coming up with a project that introduces upcoming students to the material, they may just create a project that is easy but does not introduce the material well, in order to have less work to do over the summer.\n \n Teachers should design summer projects for their students, because they know what they are teaching and how to incorporate the meaningful ideas from their class into a project, and because they know their curriculum better than their students do. Teachers are the ones ensuring that their students are prepared and know the material, and it is their responsibility to prepare their students for their curriculum. At the end of the day, the students are not the ones getting paid to teach their students.",

      "Should students have the ability to create their own projects to further their own education during the summer; or should the instructor give a teacher-designed project?Â Students should be able to make their own student-designed project. They have a say in their own education, especially when it comes to their summer break.Â Unlike teachers; students know their own limits when it comes to stress. Teachers tend to give more and more work to 'help' their students, when they are really hurting their mental state. Although, some students are proven to be less responsible than others, they are able to realize what they can and can't do. Yes, continuing student's education over the summer might be the best for them, but is it really worth stressing them out?\n \n Summer time for teachers and students, is a time for them to have fun and relax. Why have the teacher do the project on their break, when their students can do so in a way that they enjoy? Students are capable of creating a project that is fun and helps them learn new things on the way. Teachers meanwhile, might tend to put their own stress in the work, due to their break being cut down for a project. Many people tend to see students in a bad light. Such as, irresponsible, lazy, and forgetful. Rather than putting them in this bad light, we can give them a chance to choose their own learning style over the summer. Is summer break really about having fun or just having work?\n \n Many adults and teachers tend to see students in a bad light; such as: irresponsible, lazy, and forgetful. When in reality it is due to them not being motivated. When there is a chance; like this, to give a student a way to teacher themselves in their own unique way. Self-motivation is what most 'lazy' or 'irresponsible' students need when it comes to their own education. Taking these small steps, may help many students to improve their self confidence and motivation when it comes to school work. Why constantly putting students in a bad life for their past behavior, when we have a chance for them to give themselves some motivation when it comes to school work?\n \n When the time hits for summer, teachers and students want to relax, but also continue learning at the same time. Teachers tend to not realize their students limits when it comes to work. Students need self-motivation when it comes to school work sometimes. To help their education and stress levels, why not let students make their own project for the summer, for their benefit?",

    ESSAY:
      "Summer projects, although tidious and time consuming, are important. They are given to students by teachers to allow the students to retain the knowlege they have previously learned. They might also be given to teach the students new concepts before they enter the new school year. This allows teachers to teach a new concept at a faster pace since the students already taught it to themselves over the break. These project are very common in higher level classes because they require a higher level of understanding. These projects should be student-designed. I think that student-designed projects are a more efficient way for students to learn the required material over the summer break. It gives the students the flexibility that teacher-designed projects don't give. This is because students can design the project to their specific learning style and schedule and it allows the students to explore their creative side.\n \n If students design their own projects they have the ability to cater to their own learning needs. Some students are visual learners. Some benefit from repitition. Each student is vastly different from next. For example, if someone knew that they were a visual learner, they could draw pictures about the topic that they are learning about. They could illustrate a storyboard about a major war or make a cartoon about how to solve a math problem. They would not benefit from making flashcards and memorizing words because their brain deems those tactics boring. When someone's brain recognizes something as fun and enjoyable, it is more awake and ready to work. This also allows the students who don't know the best way that their brain retains information to explore and find what works best for them. This could help students in the long run by making them aware of what tactics they can use to study for tests.\n \n Students, especially high school and college level ones, usually have extremely full schedules. On the days they don't have extracurricular activities, they have work or home responsibilities. The range of what keeps a student busy is enormous. From a part-time job to band practice, students are overwhelmed with endless responsibilies. Allowing students to design their own summer projects gives them the ability to set their own work load. This takes some of the pressure off and still gives them the time to focus on other things in their lives. If a student only has two hours in their day to do school work, they won't design a project that requires them to research a topic for three hours a day and then write about it for two more hours. They will make something that allows them to research a quick topic and write a short paragraph so they can get in their eight hours of sleep.\n \n Schools focus on challenging their students academically and they champion the students who thrive in the athletic department. Schools usually fail to give any attention to the students who excel in being creative and having problem solving skills. Student-designed school projects would allow those students to thrive in making up a unique and efficient way to learn a new concept. It would also be beneficial to the students who struggle in that area, allowing them to practice and explore new ideas. As a student who stuggles in being original and creative, I would be forced to research new ways of learning. It would make me practice thinking outside of the box which is an important skill that can be applied outside of a school setting and in the workplace.\n \n Although student-designed projects allow students to make projects to their specific learning style and schedule and allows the students to explore their creative side, there are also things that teacher-designed projects are more efficient at. Teacher-designed projects make sure that what is needed to be learned, is actually learned. If a student designs their own project based on a broad topic, they may miss key terms or ideas that are essential to understanding the whole topic. When a project is guided by the teacher's instructions, students are less likely to be confused. There is also the chance that a student designs a project so they do not have to do any work. They can make one that requires them to only write their name on a piece of paper. Most projects are already teacher-designed and not many people have trouble understanding them. If students were to start designing their own projects it may leave students confused and unprepared for their class when the school year starts.\n \n I think that teacher-designed projects can be beneficial, but not to every student. Allowing the students to make their own projects makes certain that every student will learn the material in their own style and at their own pace. When teachers design projects, many students don't understand and are left behind. Even though some students may design a project that is incredibly simple, not all students want self-sabatoge like that. Most students understand that summer work can set them up for success during the school year. I think that the pros outweigh the cons on allowing students to design their own summer projects. Student-designed projects allow students to learn by their own style, learn at their own pace, and explore and implement their creative ideas.Â",

      "When was the last time you have been assigned a project over summer break? My last summer project was this past summer. It was a history project that took me days to complete. All I remember was dreading to work on the project because I already knew the information that it was about. Instead of the summer project being only a review, it should have been both a review and new information. Students get bored learning the same thing over and over again. They need something to help them for the upcoming year as they enter a new class. Therefore, summer projects should be student-designed because students would learn better, use their creative ability, and be more motivated to complete the project.\n \n Summer projects should not be about keeping the student busy. They should be about preparing the student for the new class along with helping the student retain past information. If the projects were student-designed, then students would be more likely to learn better. When I was in tenth grade, our task was to create our own project based off a certain number of topics that were given to us. I chose to do my project about World War Two. Since I chose something that I am interested in, I learned a lot of new information and information that I already knew. If I was assigned a project about old civilizations, then I probably wouldn't have learned as well as I did. This is a prime example showing how a student-designed project will help a student learn better.\n \n Creativity is something that is difficult to express for students. There are very little opportunities to express who you really are in school. Every small chance that a student gets to show their personality is an opportunity. This is another reason why summer projects should be student-designed. Furthermore, if a summer project was student-designed, then that student will have a ton of opportunities to create something that represents them. For example, an artsy student might pick a project that involves drawing or painting. An athletic student might pick a project that involves a challenge. Finally, a studious student might do a project that has a lot of work. The possibilities are endless. Having each and every student express who they are can inspire many in and out of school. This is only the second reason why summer projects should be student-designed.\n \n The last reason summer projects should be student-designed is because the students would be more motivated to complete the project. Summer is the only time that students have a long-tern break. They don't think about school or learning too often. The last thing they want to think about is another project that their teacher assigned to them. Their motivation to complete this project is very low. The only way to help motivate students would be to allow the project to be student-designed. It needs to be a project that they will enjoy doing. It can't be just another project that the teacher assigns just because why not. Last year, in chemistry, I was allowed to pick my project for my end of year science research project. I picked a topic that I wanted to see the outcome of. Throughout the entire project, I was motivated to complete it. This is because I chose what I wanted to do. Some people might say that a student can be motivated to complete a project even if it is teacher-designed. The counter to this is that when a student designs a project that they are interested in, the likelihood for that student to complete the project increases greatly. This is because they know what they want to learn about and what is interesting for them. Every little bit of motivation can help a student learn more than they thought.\n \n As you can see, student-designed projects are way better than boring teacher-designed projects. These were only just a few reasons why student-designed projects are better. Now that you know which one is better, I encourage all people to advocate around their community to make this a reality. Every student should be able to do a project on what they want to learn about. If we all used our voice to express our thoughts, then our planet would be a much better place in and outside of school.",

      "Some schools are required to assign assignments to their students to do a summer project during their summer break, but I believe that students should'nt be required to have summer projects. And I also believe that student should have a student-designed say in this because it's their choice based on if they would rather have summer assignments or not. I get it teachers want students to have summer assignments so that they're still learning but if students have assignments during their time off is that even summer break if students still have to do work during thier break.\n \n One reason why I believe that students should'nt have summer projects is because it is summer and student just want to enjoy their break and have fun. Student should have a say in this is because it's their choice if they would like to do summer projects or just enjoy and relax. I think most student would rather pick having fun and relaxing over summer projects, because for nine months students are going at least to 7 classes for nine months and learning new things, also doing projects, homework, classwork and more. If students had to have a vote for summer assignments or having a summer break without any summer projects, the majority of the students would pick summer break without any summer projects.\n \n Another reason why I believe students should design summer projects is because some students might get overwhelmed and very stressed out. School can be really stressful especially if you're failing some of your classes and getting a lot of work. Another reason why I think school is stressful is because you have seven classes and most teachers asign assignments to their students, this can be stressful for students because they have a lot of work to finish and some assignment are due the next or next class and they have to think about their other class assignments. Most students have a job and they won't have time to their summer assignment or they either went to vaction because summer time is about relaxing and having no worries, it should be a stress free summer. Summer is a time to enjoy while there is no school or no work assignments, summer break is a time to spend time with family and go to fun places and explore new things and places, not just doing school work while it is summer break.\n \n The final reason why I believe that student should have a say in summer project is because students should have a good time off. Students should'nt have summer projects because some students might go to summer school and have to do more work on top of summer projects, while they're doing summer school work , it could lead to some students not doing the summer project because summer school is too much stress for them. When student are in school they aren't really going on vaction or they aren't going out as much having fun because of school. The majority of the student don't want to miss school because if they miss school for a day it can back up them up from learning and not knowing anything that is going on in class. And summer break is about going out on vaction and exploring new things and adventure's, also not having to worry what time they have to be home for school or doing any assignment because it is summer break they should be able to enjoy it until school starts again. The majority of students don't go out on school day or during the weekends because they're either busy, working or just don't have time, that's why we have summer break so that we can relax and have fun and not worry about summer assignments.\n \n In conclusion these are the three main reasons as to why I believe that students should be students should not be assigned summer projects , so that they can enjoy their summer vaction off and being stress free until school starts again, I also believe that all students and staff should have off so that they all get a break and time off to relax and have family time.Â",

      "For most, summer is filled with unwinding from the stresses of school, traveling to new places, and learning new skills. This break is given to students to relax and reflect on all of their hard work. Summer allows students to find activities that they are passionate about. Summer assignments should be student-designed because this allows students to determine the extent and length, the topic, and the platform the project will take place on. This break in between moving onto the next level of education is meant for students to distress and enjoy life outside of school. Surely, making the summer projects more student-based allows for scholars to continue to learn, while also allowing students to enjoy time off.\n \n An important part of growing as a person and figuring out what career path to go down in the future is exploring possible interests. This break from the school year allows for students to do this outside of school, as well as time given to relax. If the length of the projects assigned over the summer are chosen by teachers, the students could end up with a big work load which takes away from their opportunities. Many students get jobs over the summer to gain work experience before furthering their education after high school. Not only does this help them build their transcript and resume before moving onto a new chapter in life, but it also allows them to figure out what they like do versus what they do not like to do. Students who are overwhelmed with summer projects are more inclined to not get a job or participate in the things they like to do, which defeats the purpose of the break.\n \n Another positive outcome of student-designed projects is students can have a say in what they want to research. If the students are allowed to pick the topic of their projects that have to do with the associated class, they are more likely to have better work and learn more. Again, this break is given to scholars to allow them to enjoy life outside of school. By giving students no say in the topic they are furthering their learning on, they are less inclined to do their best work or even any work at all. Having students pick the topic of their summer assignments would surely make the projects more enjoyable and easier for the students to complete.\n \n Finally, the last component that students should be able to determine for their summer projects is the platform they use to complete the project. Hands-on students prefer to do projects on a poster board, while more tech-savvy students would prefer to use Google slides or Prezi to present their work. Giving students a say in the way they are able to complete their project makes it a lot more enjoyable for them, essentially making it easier to complete. There are many different types of learners like people who prefer to visualize the topic they are learning about or people who would rather hear more on the topic. More visual learners may have better time comprehending the subject of the project if they can add visuals to the projects by hand. Audible learners may want to listen to videos regarding the topic and film a podcast discussing their work to better process the research they have done.\n \n Student-designed projects allow for better learning and understanding of the topic, while still allowing students to enjoy their time off from school. Although, student should have a say in the subject, length, and platform of their summer projects, teachers should also set boundaries for these projects. It would be pointless for students to study a topic not relating to the class at all. Teachers could provide students with a list of subjects to research that they can pick from. There should also be guidelines that pertain to the length of the project because it is unfair if some students work really hard on the summer projects, yet others slack off for the same grade. However, the students should have some say in the amount of work they chose to do. Students should also be given multiple platforms to choose from, but not completely free range. The risk with giving students a free range of platforms is students could use platforms that teachers are not familiar with. Students should be given the choice of the topic, length, and platform concerning their summer assignments with teacher guidelines. It is important to keep students learning, while also letting them participate in the things they are passionate about.",

That is not always fun, especially for students when they have summer break.\n \n Everyone loves to relax and not do anything. That is what summer vacation is for, it allows people, especially students to have some quality time off. Students do not always do their homework, from personal experience that is true. That is why they have less chance of doing projects during the summer when they can be relaxing instead. If they are giving the option to select their own projects they desire, they will more likely finish the project and have fun while doing it.\n \n That allows students to stay interested in a certain topic they love to learn about. This makes projects during break way more fun, and it increases the chances of students doing the projects. From personal experience, learning about topics I am passionate about or interested in, makes it way more fun to research and learn about.\n \n People might disagree that students do not don't care about their projects, or that they won't do it, regardless what topic it is about.

Yet some schools believe that their students need to continue to study, and learn over this long break. Summer is a time that has always been advertised as a time to go on vacation and put down all the books for a series of weeks to have fun. Yet for some students this isn't an option some teachers assign rigorous assignments for students to complete which can completely control and ruin theirÂ time off. By having students plan their own summer assignments, students can still excel and be ready for school when they return, and have that ideal Summer that isn't behind a book or keyboard.\n \n Giving students the opportunity to create, and design their own Summer work opens endless opportunities and can actually inspire learning new things inside and outside of the standard curriculum. By having majority of students elect a certain amount of peers to create these assignments for them, which would give a students insight on how much work we should be given, and how flexible it should be. Teachers still will have to approve of the work created and revise if, and as needed to make sure it is adequate and follows the curriculum to prepare students. With all of this said and done, many arguments can arise about how elected students could give minimalist work because they feel pressured by friends and other peers to make it easy, which is all more reasons teachers should still oversee the process, and decide if it is fair or not.\n \n If schools eventually decide to let students design, and assign their own Summer homework this could still come with much skepticism, being a new concept means it could come with some minor flaws to be discovered. Yet with the proper determination and open willingness to change both students and teachers can benefit and be ready for the new school year when they return with the newly founded knowledge they need to succeed in their new year, while having their ideal vacations and spending time with their family instead of being behind a book or keyboard.",

      "One time in the 5th grade me and my classmates were given an assignment that we were told to design by ourselves. We were told to choose any format to present our projects and allowed to present it on any topic as long as it related to science. As the deadline for the project drew near many students talked about how they had not completed the project because they lacked direction. As a result many students received bad grades and teachers struggled to grade individual projects on the same scale due to varying formats and topics. Many schools are questioning whether summer assignments should be designed by students or teachers. Mandatory summer projects shouldÂ be designed by teachers to guarantee that students have a clear understanding of requirements and continue to learn over the break.\n \n Educators best understand the curriculum students need to keep up with. In the majority of schools different departments are run by teachers working together to design the courses. If summer projects are designed by the same teachers then schools can ensure that the assignments will help students prepare for upcoming classes.\n \n Additionally, these projects can give a general idea of how the class will be taught and how difficult the course will be. This way students can get a head start on the material and have a complete understanding of what will be required.\n \n When designing tasks teachers can ensure that students are given enough work to learn. Over the summer of my freshman year I was given a project where students were allowed to choose which book they read and write a report on it. Many students chose short novels and finished their assignments in only a day. This caused any potential learning to be lost as students mostly forgot about the assignment after completing it. Projects designed by teachers can ensure that students do enough work over their break to continue learning outside of school and that the work matches the level of the class.\n \n Teachers can give additional support and instruction on assignments they designed. When projects are created by students teachers may struggle to help them with questions they may have. In the English department at my school teachers all work together to design large projects so that anyone in the department can answer questions and help students. This leads to a better understanding among students but still allows them to create unique and individual products that promote growth.\n \n Projects assigned over long breaks should be designed by teachers because teachers can better understand the curriculum, ensure that students learn, and provide additional support on assignments. In the future more assignments could be created that allow students to get a glimpse at upcoming material. Long breaks that often cause students to lose touch with the rhythm of school can be turned into opportunities to prepare. We should all encourage the furthering of our education by demanding that schools around us help students learn over break and require teachers to design summer projects for students.Â  Â Â Â",

    ESSAY:
      "During the summer, students across the world are given a break from school and the stress it entails. Although I believe summer break is an important thing for students, it can also be harmful educationally. This is because when students take extended breaks from their regular education, they often tend to forget things regarding their previous curriculum, and this break can also make it emotionally harder for students to return to school at the end of their summer break. Schools who require their students to complete summer projects have proved higher scores in student testing and graduation rates. I believe that these projects should be teacher-designed rather than student-designed. This is because teacher-designed summer projects would be more specific to curriculum, more educational, and more effective regarding preparation for the start of the school year, opposed to student-designed projects.\n \n To begin, I believe that teacher-designed projects would be more specific to curriculum opposed to student-designed projects. This is because teachers have further knowlege of upcomming curriculum while students do not. Therefore, the teacher-designed projects would be more hlepful in preparing a student for his or her upcoming classes. For example, if a teacher were to design a history project for a rising senior taking government for their next history class, the project would likely be based on a summary or unit in the students upocoming class. This project would be a simple way of preparing this student for their upcoming class and the curriculum it involves. If the student had designed the project themself, it may be on the wrong materal or may not be focused on important information they'll need during their upcoming school year. Although it is important to gain a basis of all knowledge, the more specific infomation a teacher would be able to demonstrate would be far more effective and helpful for a student in the long run.\n \n Secondly, I believe that teacher-designed projects would be far more educational than student-designed projects during the summer. This is because teachers have previously attended college and have earned degrees to professionally provide education to students. As experts in this field, a teacher would likely include more useful and informative information on a summer project, thus making the project far more effective. If a student were to design a project this could result in an activity that is not nearly as educational, helpful, and ultimately worth-while. If there are more educational benefits included in summer projects it can successfully provide an oppurtunity for students to learn and grow, while a student-designed project may lack this needed education which could result in a class being too challenging, stressful, and this student having an ultimately harder school life.\n \n Lastly, I strongly believe that teacher-designed projects would be far more effective regarding preparation for the start of a students school year. Teachers are aware of the details included in certain classes, and they have knowlege of a lot more information about these courses than a student would. Although a student may effectively design a summer project based on previoulsy taken classes, I believe education can only be expanded through gaining more knowledge regarding future classes, and these projects would likely be more effective if they were focused more toward a student's upcoming schooling rather than their previous education. This would allow the student to be effectively prepared and ready for the new school year, and possibly more prepared for some challenging courses they may end up taking in thier future, whether that is in grade school or earning a more advance degree. Not only would the teacher-designed project prepare them further, but it could also effectively make their next school year less stressful and more comprehendable. The teacher-designed project would not only prepare them for future education, but it could also prepare them for real-world struggles. For example, if a teacher-designed project ends up being challenging and stressful for a student, it will act as many real-life struggles. If this student were able to put hard work into completing this project, not only will they be further prepared educationally, but it could have the ability of showing them that life has challenges that may seem difficult but are never impossible.\n \n As time passes and problems are thrown at us, it seems as though young people are the one's with problem-solving ideas, and although I strongly stand by the idea of children and young people progressing our world, it is important that these students inquire the proper education to do so. That is why I believe that teacher-designed summer projects would be immensely more effective than student-designed projects during the summer. If students are able to complete these teacher-designed summer projects it could make their schooling more effective, thus producing future societal contributors. These teacher-designed projects could be a driving force in creating a problem solving adult who in the longrun could change the future of our fast-paced world and its many obstacles.",

      "Summer projects are often assigned to students to ensure learning continues over the summer. They help keep students' hands moving and gears turning. Projects are typically designed by teachers, however, when made by students the work load is easier to handle and is best fitted to each, individual student. Teachers can't always make classwork fun and engaging. By having a student make their own project, it takes the work load off the teacher and gives the student work they will enjoy doing. Additionally, most projects made by teachers have the same structure, therefore, it would be easier for students to cheat. Lack of supervision and a surplus of free time can lead to unwantedÂ collaborations.\n \n Everyone knows students dislike school, It has loud teachers and bone numbing A/C. Students are constantly falling asleep in class, not listening, and avoiding work. Being assigned a project over their sunny Summer break must be a bummer, right? That's what most people think, but assigning work that students have more liberty over can give them the upper-hand. They can choose a project that they have the supplies for, set it so it doesn't take much effort or time, and not to mention, they can be creative! They get an opportunity to explore something they're passionate about. And when a student is passionate about something, they make sure everyone knows.\n \n Projects take up time. In the Summer, time is in excess. Giving out a project makes sure they always have something to do. Students loose a lot over their break, they come back to school perplexed at a simple math problem. Take Generic_Name into example, she's an A-B student but every summer she looses what she learned that school year and it takes a few weeks for her to get back on track. Usually her first report card has C's and even D's. But one summer in 10th grade she was assigned two projects and her first report card in 11th grade had ALL A's! She was way ahead of the class and felt more confident when completing her assignments. Practice is key to gaining knowledge. With students tongue tied, Summer projects help turn their question marks into exclamation points!\n \n The teacher may also get a better understanding of his/her students. They get to see what they like, what inspires them, what makes them mad, what makes them said or what they have strong opinions on. It makes it easier to relate to a generation that seems illegible on the exterior. Kids can be confusing, especially with the professional relationship of teachers and students. They can't be as personal with their students, even then, there's too many to even try!\n \n Student-made projects give teachers an easy window into their individuality. Future projects may also improve and become better suited to the audience. Complaints about the complexity or disappointment of their assignment will disappear. And, yet again, the work load that is removed. No more stressing about what they should learn, just some simple guidelines and grading rubric. They could even make their own!\n \n Teachers put a lot of effort into their job, some would say the most out of any job. Their own money and heart is put into their work. They buy students supplies and are even are taught as if they were the teacher's own! There will always be that one kid that wants to show off and ends up biting off more than he can chew. Teachers give great structure by making it themselves. Projects are also easier to grade because they would all have the same structure. Summer projects can be a great way to keep minds growing over that long break, it just depends on the situation as to who should create the project.",

      "Almost everyone who attended school can attest to how boring and tedious summer work can be. Whether it's assigned reading or a project, students often dislike having schoolwork cut into their summertime. However, it is a necessary evil, and although there are compelling arguments for self-directed learning and independent study, the fact remains that it's the teacher's job to know how to help their students learn. Summer work should be designed via a partnership of students and teachers, so that students can learn in ways that interest them and help them grow, and teachers can ensure that the material is taught correctly.\n \n While the intervention of teachers in this process may seem to be too controlling or unnecessary, the fact remains that they have gone through a lengthy process to ensure that they are trained to teach the material as effectively as possible. They go through an extensive process involving obtaining at least a bachelor's degree as an undergraduate student (and in many cases going even further and pursuing post-graduate studies), spending time as a student teacher, obtaining other certifications, and taking part in continuing teacher training throughout their careers. The experience and education that teachers have is simply too much to ignore when considering the development of a student's summer project or curriculum.\n \n Another factor to consider when advocating for students developing their own projects or curriculum is that all students are different. Some may not design their own work with their own best educational interests in mind, and others may not do as well learning via a highly structured summer project or curriculum. Yes, some students are very bright or passionate and will diligently undertake projects and studies on their own, but that is not true for all students. Everyone learns differently, and many people thrive in situations where they have specific guidelines and rules to follow or goals to meet. The wide range of learning and personality types in schools is a major reason why summer projects and curricula should be a collaborative effort between students and teachers. No two students learn the same, so why should they be forced to do the same work?\n \n Although there are many good reasons for students doing projects that were designed by a teacher, it is also important to consider the fact that teachers may simply be out of touch with how their students wish to learn. Student-designed work can be incredibly fulfilling upon completion; the student will have identified an area of study they enjoy, pursued and researched it, and hopefully will have reached a fulfilling conclusion through a project, experiment, or assignment. However, all of this can be accomplished to its fullest potential with the help of an adult. A trusted mentor (such as a teacher), can be an invaluable resource to a young person undertaking a major project on their own.\n \n Much of education deals with absolutes. Standardized testing, graduation requirements, etc., etc. One can go on and on describing all of the things that individuals must do to conform with the school system. All of this is necessary to ensure that all students find success. However, summer work is a wonderful opportunity for a student's individuality to shine through, and with the help of a teacher, they can design work that will be fulfilling and extremely educational.",

Why? because it's their summer and if it's a boring project that a teacher assigned it's most likely not going to get done , because it don't catch the student interest if the student design their own project they created it's most likely to get done because it's something that he/she likes.\n \n Teacher design might not be what the students are interested in , and they might not understand it. If the student creates their design it could be fun and easy for them, and they will be learning from it as well, and they will understand it more because they are make whatever out of it. They could do it in their own way which will also make them determine to complete their own design they created.\n \n Students design could also help the teachers too , they wouldn't have to do much planning cause the students have to come up with their own designs so the students have to come out with ideas on their own. The students will be engaged because they have to focus on what they will come up with for their design for this summer project also the enjoyment they would get out for creating their own design project. The students will be learning it in their own way that's not boring to them. That way it will keep them motivated and interested while they are working on their project.\n \n Student's should have a right to do something that would be entertaining to them since it's the summer and they have to work on it so they can continue to learn.

      "Work over the summer sounds boring enough, it creates less time to have fun over the summer break. However, what if it was the students to design the summer project, that can be based on a interest, a hobby, or an activity. In addition, if this was a possibility, creativity can shine on a student project, and a sense of pride upon working, so while doing work, student can enjoy of what they enjoy, share their ideas and passion. While others believe, that teacher should designed the summer projects; However, if the summer project was a student design, it'll benefits students and gives freedom to work on what they are interested.\n \n If were to be students designing a summer project for school, it brings out the creativity and how its unique from comparing other student's projects. Also, this summer project can spark a students passion or ideas to share, and create a voice for themselves. Moreover, student designed project, can cause less vulnerability of copying others projects, it creates a space where everyone is unique in their own way. I've done this project similar to the summer project, but mine wasn't in the summer, this was an annual thing where students share their ideas or passion in the criteria of being a creative and critical thinking, communication, etc. The project was a student based work, this benefited everyone to become unique and show your ideas to be a being collaborator, or communicator. Their were many different projects and many different voices spread across the school, it made me to feel that being different is great and striving for the passion is a key to owning success. I had fun doing this project, it gave me more freedom, it made me connect to more people who has same passion and ideas as I did. If the summer project was a student design project, it can help people spread their passion.\n \n From the project, there was not a lot of commitmentÂ for sharing ideas. ProcrastinationÂ happens a lot, student can pretend to work on it because they are afraid that it will take to long, or worked on it poorly just for a good grade. Also, how would the grading system work on the summer project, how can a teacher grade on a student of their ideas. Moreover, a teacher designed project would set standards of the project and can help students complete it, and it can be easy to know the rules of making the project. When I was preparing my project, I saw many student did their work but with low quality work, their wasn't a lot ofÂ encouragementÂ to the students project. There should be requirements on the summer project, to make rules that are not strict, but can set and help students to regulate their project.\n \n In conclusion, student designed project should be the main design, it helps student bring out their creative side and share ideas. Although, this can lead into lazy work, to no work at all, or no encouragement among students. Setting regulations and rules toward the project, can help to set up thier ideas or passion to share.Â",

      "When it's summer it basically means freedom for all kids. But there are some schools who do give their kids summer projects for them to do so they still lean during their break and they are all teacher designed. Students should be able to design their own projects because they can make time to work and pick their own deadlines, make their own instructions for them to understand, and how they learn by themselves.\n \n Students should be able to make time for their projects and pick their own deadlines. When you are assigned a project at school; the teacher picks the time for you to be able to work on your project. But there are times were these picked times affect students other life. Some may already have plans to do something whether it's going on a trip or just hanging out with friends, and family. And it's sorta ruined because now they have to stress on finishing a project during their plans. And a thing to avoid students from getting is stress. During the school year kids already have enough stress to deal with because they are given a lot work to do and only have a certain amount of time to finish their assignments. Lets not have students stress during their long break which they deserve. By allowing them to pick their time to work, and picking their deadlines; it'll eliminate the stress, and they can have their fun without it getting ruined.\n \n Teacher when they assign projects; they get to make the instructions on how to do the assignment. Sometimes the instructions are clear for some students, but for the others it isn't. Students are always told to ask their teachers if they have any questions or don't understand the assignment. But for some students, asking questions and trying to understand what to do still isn't clear for them, and they go ahead and try to figure it out themselves doing more work and once again giving them stress; only to find out they did it wrong. By allowing them to make their own instructions, it'll be clear for them to understand and they won't have to go through a lot of hard work to figure out what to do. Students already know what they need to know, and by making them do something they don't know at all, won't help them at all in the future. And they don't want to learn something they didn't know during the school year and now they have to learn it during there break.\n \n A teachers goal is to teach their students as well as possible, and hope that what they taught their student; they continue to still use it in their future. Allowing students to make their own assignments can show what they have learned from their teachers. It can help the teachers show what they need to teach future students and it shows that they are doing a good job to students education. And it'll show how well they can work on their own with the knowledge they have acquired, and with their creative mind they can come up with amazing things.. Teachers want to see one of their students as a leader; and by giving them the chance to make their own projects, is giving the current leader hope that their student can carry the touch for others. And during the summer they can learn more on their own which is what the teachers want: and show huge improvements to their learning.\n \n Students should be able to make their own assignments because they can make the time to do their work, can make their own instructions, and show what they have learned. Teachers ever year are teaching the new generation what they need to know and how to do it. They should let their students design their own assignments because it'll be a huge benefit for them, and as well a huge one to teachers. These students can come up with amazing projects that may lead to teachers using their projects to be assigned to other students. And to the teachers reading this, let us have a chance to do it.Â",

      "Projects over the summer? Seems unreal to adults, but the students are the ones who have to complete the project. All of the projects are normally teacher designed and are made to challenge the students, which benefits the students in the long run. If a student, or body of students was to design the project that the entire school would have to complete, it would most likely be too easy and would be completed in a matter of a week or two. These students also have no experience in designing a project, as the teachers do this for a living, so having a student design it, the project would be much too easy and would make no sense at all. So, teachers should always be the ones who design summer projects for the high school students.\n \n If students designed a project that they were supposed to complete, they would make it too easy. Why would a student(s) design a project that they have to complete at some point throughout the summer, and make it insanely hard for themselves and other students? In fact, they would not, they would make the project or assignment simple and short for ease of completion. When a student goes on break he or she will not want to do anything but have fun, and by having a project this would eliminate part of the fun. So, if a student designed it, they would make it work not only around their schedule, but also around their free time in order to have the most fun during break. If a teacher was to create the project, it would be long, hard, and complicated in order to make the students think and keep their brain working over the entirety of summer break. Which leads me to my next point, why have a student do it, when a teacher gets paid to do it, and do it well?\n \n When a teacher has been creating material for students to do for his or her entire life, why switch to students to create this work? Well, we should not, having students create their own assignments would be pointless, as they have teachers to do it and assign the project to them for a living. Teachers know much more than students when it comes to designing any sort of work that gets assigned to the students. When a student designs an assignment it also adds even more work for them to do as well as more stress for the students, which can add up as time goes on, as there is only so much work a student canÂ do at once. Teachers are also much better at designing projects that fit everyone in the class as the teacher knows how most people learn and how they learn the best, whether that be though working hands on, via audio, or visual learning. The teacher will always produce a better project, which is why teachers should stay making the assignments and students should continue to complete them without complaining. Also, would students not attempt to post-pone the completion of the design in order to cancel it altogether.\n \n Via post-poning the entire design of the project, students would think that this would cancel the entirety of the project, which is false. This is another advantage of having a teacher design the project, he or she would most likely get the project designed and handed out to the students in a timely manor. This is something that most of the students would not be able to do, so having a student design it is not the best option. There could also be many setbacks and distractions for the students, like phones, jobs, friends, etc. All of these are examples of distractions that could set the project design back a lot. Although teachers could have the same problems, they are much more mature and know how to deal with the distractions as well as get work done at the same time. These are all reasons that the teachers would get the project designed in a more timely manor than the students.\n \n Finally students would not be the best option for designing these summer projects because students would try to make it too easy, post pone the project design, as well as teachers get paid for this as it is their job. So, students would slack off and get little to no work done due to distractions, and clever ways to get out of designing and completing the project. So teachers should stay designing the project and this should not change for good reason as well.",

    Essay: "As summer break begins, students utilize the time as a break from school to complete and indulge themselves into numerous and fun activities. However, to ensure the active learning of students, some school assign projects that require work being done over the break. With that being said, the projects should be designed by students than teachers to ensure the creativity and originality of the projects assigned as well as, the development of the students coming into the new school year.\n \n Student designed projects will allow students to be solely responsible for their learning and topics in which the project will be on. This will eventually display each individual's independence and ability to complete the project and will hopefully allow the student to accommodate skills such as time management and a sense independence in their work. As students work on their projects, they will able to complete them on their own time with their own ideas that interest them. With student designed projects, they will know how to follow their own instructions, rules and regulations concerning the project and determine their own continued learning outside of school during the break that will benefit them as individuals. Seeing that the students do well, this will further contribute to their qualities and assist in building them up as fit individuals of society. Also with the independenceÂ of being able to create their own assignment, teachers will become eager to see what the students have come up with and surprised with the work and skills the students will show through their projects in which they have accommodated. This will effectively allow teachers to be amazed with the learning abilities of the students and base their teachings around the completion of the projects in order to ensure the success of the students. Teachers will also be able to understand the students views and standpoints as well as, where they're coming from as far as knowledge goes. Schools will see the benefit of allowing the students to design their projects based off the maturity and work executed by the students through their summer projects.\n \n As the students are gaining the knowledge needed in completing the projects, they can develop a sense of authenticityÂ and creativity by designing themselves. Students can include their own unique and funÂ ways of development and learning into the projects to assist them completing it in the best way possible. By doing so, the students can enjoy learning, work and projects all at the same time. Furthermore, they can develop innovative thinking strategies while including their own interests in which allow them to formulate an excellent project. Student designed project over teacher designed projects also benefit the students more directly because it targets their own thinking and reasoning in which contribute to the creativity but mainly the authenticity aspect of it . Students will possibly utilize a topic that caters to their continued learning outside of school. This can help build up their character and personality by displaying it through the assigned projects in which they developed. Schools can then see the head spaceÂ of their students and then allow them to have more control over their learning.\n \n Hopefully with student developed and designed projects, students can display their own learning qualities and create excellent projects that display what the schools intend them to learn over the break. Also this can give teachers a bit of a surprise and a break as well by allowing the students to take control of how they want to learn. By the school and teachers doing so, they can grant the students with the leverage and ability to learn in their own individual and innovativeÂ ways.Â  Â Â Â Â",

    Essay: "Summer Projects\n \n As students get older, more teachers assign summer projects to insure that the students are prepared for the following school year. However, in many instances, students are not engaged in what they are learning. Summer projects should be a collaborative effort between both the student and the teacher to insure that all students and teachers feel like they are heard and grow along the way.\n \n Teachers need to be a part of designing summer projects in order to maintain the level of learning and to stay on topic. With teachers contributing to the project, they are able to steer projects down a certain path in order to make sure that the students are getting what they should be out of it. By including teachers into the project building, they make sure that what the students are doing is educational along with reasonable for the class and that the students aren't trying to give themselves minimal amounts or work. For instance, many English teachers make their students read books over the summer and reflect on the book itself. This gives students an individualized opportunity to advance and excel as they get to follow along with what a teacher, a specialist in a specific field, knows about a topic while applying it out on their own.\n \n Students should be a part of the summer project process in order to not only have a more leadership and engaging role, but to also insure that they are learning about something that they are interested in. Multiple reports and experiments done, such as one on\n \n Brain Games , shows that kids have a more creative mind. In a specific clip of a\n \n Brain Games experiment, adults and children were asked to come up with as many pictures or figures as they could with a ball and two sticks. The children more than doubled the amount of images that the adults did. This shows the creativity that students have, and applying that to a lesson will help make the lesson more intriguing for young minds. Students generally like projects that give them a creative boost; for instance, when teachers say they can present something in any way that they want. And allowing students and teachers to work on designing summer projects together keeps the projects civil and in range, but also gives it the opportunity for it to be fun and creative.\n \n In addition, including students in the development of summer projects benefits them and the rest of their classmates. If a child is given a book, they may read it, or they may not. However, if a child gets to pick out a book, they are much more likely to be attached to it and feel the urge to read it, as it is theirs . The same thing applies to students of all ages. If students help design the summer projects, it allows them an opportunity to get attached to something and to take pride in something. In many cases, this causes people to work harder and care more about what they are doing, rather than just taking it for a grain of salt and moving along.\n \n When dealing with students and teachers working together, some might say that there then is an unfair advantage to those who designed the project when it comes time to grading. The solution to this, though, is that it is not that teacher that is grading the projects. When students move on to the next grade level, they have a new teacher. So if a 10th grade student is helping design their summer project, it will be graded by their 11th grade teacher, therefore eliminating any bias. Another solution to this problem is to have students create the summer project for the class that they were in at the time. For instance, a 10th grader could help design a project for the rising 10th graders, thus eliminating any bias along with allowing them to see what they liked about the previous project and make any changes that they think are necessary.\n \n Finally, both parties are equally vital to summer projects because apart from getting a better education, it teaches students and teachers to work together on issues and education, which is something that is hard to find throughout the school year. Throughout the normal school year, teachers are seen as the authority figure with all of the power in the classroom setting. Although that is true in a way, having students and teachers collaborate on projects opens up a door for them to share ideas, as most students feel their ideas on a normal basis are sub-par and often times don't end up sharing them. It helps bridge the gap between teachers and students, allowing them to be more trusting while also gaining respect for one another. By allowing this collaboration, students will be able to see the hard work that teachers put into lessons and such and might end up appreciating it more, while teachers may gain a clearer insight on how students think after working with students.\n \n It is evident that both students and teachers should design summer projects for the students in order to get the best quality work out of the project itself along with helping them both grow as people. By allowing this crossover bridge for students and teachers, it helps the education system grow as a whole and offers both teachers and students an opportunity for growth, and growth is what the education system and teaching is all about.",

If they are allowed to design their own projects chances are they will perform better on the assignment.\n \n Summer projects are typically given to students enrolled in higher level classes. In order for students to do well in these types of classes they have to have their own motivation to complete assignments. I am currently enrolled in an AP class and I also had to complete a summer assignment. I had to come up with a hypothetical experiment and review ways to improve the experiment. In order to do this I had to have motivation to design the experiment rather than relying on a teacher to design it for me.\n \n Allowing the students to design something of their own gives them the ability to use creativity. Not only is this more enjoyable for the students, but also for the teachers. If a teacher has to grade the same general project over and over again that can become very boring. However, grading projects that were designed differently can be more enjoyable for the teacher. Completing my summer project of course was not the best thing in the world, but being able to use my own creativity made it a lot more tolerable.\n \n No one wants to spend their summer completing school work. Summer is a time for students to step back from the stresses of school and enjoy the long break. However, preparing for the future never stops, and summer projects are not going away. When summer projects are student-designed it gives the students a chance to be independent, find their inner motivation, and use creativity in order to enjoy getting the assignment done.Â",

    Essay: "Our school normally has every student do a project during the summer to keep us learning and its normally designedÂ by teachers but, this year they asked all the students in quick little 1 answer survey the question statedÂ was \"should students or teacher design students summer projects\", so as I thought about it and I realized to myself that even though normally teacher make the project and i agree that they would give us more informed information and standardized questions that are on topic with the information we should learned but I feel as tho less students complete them and have less of a connection to the work and since it being summer more work would make more students procrastinate more to actually complete the work but on the other hand I truly believe agree that summer projects would be accomplished more if it was by student design and students would be more connected to the work and take way less time trying to finish there summer projects.\n \n students during summer tend have a lotÂ of free time except for those who tend to take up summer jobs or camps and are less focus on other things and tend to mainly focus on work during summer and tend not have time to do a large teacher design summer project packet but, it would be easier for those to make there project because design by them and they would focus more something they create would be way will to finish something they design then some work just given to them by a teacher during summer.\n \n when teachers generally design a summer project to help keeps learning they tend make sure its at least enough knowledge and work to keep u busy for month and so u can keep gaining knowledge and when students continue to gain knowledge that means there would less need reteaching students previously learned knowledge and which would make students even smarter then where before.\n \n most time when a summer project is teacher design there way more work to do lot tend question and answer projects packets that tend to be really thick with work normally they will be like a 1,000 page packet with 800 questions and answer with key information coming be for the questions that have read through then answer questionsÂ which most find not entertaining and like extra and tend to seriously not do the work because its so much work for them accomplish and they rather do other things with there summer.\n \n when project are normally student design they are normally a creative project you have make and design using the given topic a students are free to show what they actually know and are more connected to the work because they get to set up there project and can have much information as students need or want and help to have little more fun while gaining knowledge.\n \n in conclusion I believe even though teacher design project contain a lotÂ of work and knowledge but tend to be excessive in the questionsÂ and required work and furthermore student design projects are better for summer project easier to do most students complete them at a faster rate and over all it shows more what the students learned.",

    Essay: "There are some schools that require summer projects for the students. What if they were student-designed rather than teacher-designed? With student going into their summer break and also teachers the thought of school really doesn't come to mind. With the requirements of the projects of students during the summer maybe students can add their own spice to the mixture. My thoughts on the idea that the project should be student based is that they can have their own personality to their project, put their own time into it, and the teachers can get to know their students.\n \n With the idea that the project should be student based they can add their own twist to the project. I have a friend who went around Europe with her family during the summer. During her time there she still had to do a project for one of her classes and wasn't getting back home till a week before school started back up again. So during her stay she went to the popular places in Europe and tried to make connections of those places for her project. She told me that she had a lotÂ of fun doing that with her project and that it even made it fun for her when she would edit it because it reminded her of the fun times that she had over there. Even though during the trip she said she preferred that she didn't have to work on a project during the time that she was away from school. She still had fun during the process with the idea that she had control over how she wanted to design it.\n \n There are many students that usually get summer jobs so they might not have all the time in the world to focus on a project. My brother was some one that loved to work and when summer came around he would work all the time. He was in art classes in his high school years so they had to get some art pieces during the summer. At times at work if things weren't busy he would just get a napkin and draw little sketchesÂ that might come to mind. With some of his days off he would look back at the little sketches that he made and see if anything thing that he drew would give him inspiration. That's how he would do his art project and it worked for him. He pulled out multiple beautiful artworks that to this day he is very proud of. At time he wouldn't do some of the artwork since he might of been very busy the day prier and might of been very tired. He still had pushed even harder when he did work on the project. My brother would work during the summer and with the spare time that he had he would more effort into the project with the time he had free.\n \n Teachers can already get a basic idea on what kind of person that they might be getting in their coming up class. I'm good friends with my sophomore history teacher so we talk before school. She planned a project for the up coming sophomores to see what's their personality was and if they basic history. She told me that she can see many different personality in her class by just looking at their projects. Some student are very artistic or they know details about certain events that went on in history. You can see so much in a singleÂ project of a student that they make it into their own. Right out of the back she already knew how to approach and what they can do in the future so that the student get their education but also have their own talents shine through. Some students might not put so much effort into their projects so we might not get a heads start into their characteristics. It nice to at leastÂ to have a good understanding of the students before you actually meet them so they can have an amazing school year.\n \n With the idea that students should be able to design their own summer project is something that should be talked about. In the past most of the assignments are teachers giving it to the students and expecting them to follow a rubric. Things can change with the student must come up with something that they are proud to show and make it their own. With something small can lead to bigger things like just a simple summer project. Students should be able to add their own personality intoÂ it, put their own time into it, and that teachers can get to know the students though their project.Â Â",

    Essay: "If you are assigned a summer project, would you rather you or your teacher assign the topic? Lets face it school work can be boring, but what if you got to choose what the project was based on? It would probably be alot funner, and would make the kids want to do it. Every kid has a big imagination and it is important to use it every chance you get. Maybe once every kid is complete you can compare the different ideas each kid has. Every kid has to want to learn to be able to learn, therefor if the kid is doing a project and its on a topic they will enjoy they are more likely to complete and/or learn for the project.\n \n As a student in high school right now, I know what it is like to do project and how boring they can be. You feel like its a waste of time, and you dont want to do it. But if the teacher allows the students to pick their own topic, the kids would want to do it. They can use their imaginattion, favorite charectors, or even favorite tv show.\n \n Once all the students come back from summer break you can even compare the students ideas. See how every students project is different, how creative each student is, and how far their imagination can go. but also when a student is learning, it can be very boring sitting in school everyday doing worksheets and such, But if the student is learning something they actually enjoy, it will be much easier and let the kids actually want to learn. For example, a student may not be as interested in reading a poem and answer a page full of questions. But if you let that same kid watch a full epesode of sponge bob, then tell that kid to write a story based on that epesode they just watched, they would do it.\n \n Using your imagination in life I believe is key, their is nothing you can't do in life if u put your mind to it. You will make it far in life if you think outside the box. As a kid, using your imagination while working can be one of the biggest benefits but most kids don't realize that. If you do not have an interest in what your learning majority of the time it's going to go in one ear and out the other. That is why if you use your imagination while your learning it would brighten some things up and make it funner to do work.\n \n In conclusion, doing work that the student can decide on would be a better learning experience for the kids, easier, and more effective. And if you are like me, then you can use your imagination to turn any assigned work into a better learning experience.Â  Â Â Â Â",

    Essay: "When asked to do summer projects, students normally cringe a little. But, if you let the students choose what the project should be about, then they will want to complete it a little bit more than when a teacher designs it. In this paper I will be explaining why students should design their own projects instead of teachers. Students should design their own projects because they will be more excited and eager to work on it, the projects would be better because the students would most likely spend more time on it, and lastly the students would get to enjoy more of their summer because they would get the project done and not feel like they worked super hard.\n \n If the students were to design their own project they would be more eager to work on it. This is because the people that make the topic usually have some interest in the topic. And with interest in the topic the students would want to work and actually spend time on the project. When a teacher makes a project it is almost always less appealing than a student made project. Causing the students to not want to work on it and learn. this is why a student made project would cause the students to be eager and ready to learn more about the topic.\n \n Furthermore, the projects would be better because the students actually care about them. See when a teacher makes the project, A student like myself would just rush to get it done and get a good passing grade then enjoy my summer. but if students made it, I would most likely spend a little more time on it causing the project to be more complete and more presentable. In return students would get a decent grade, be more informed about the topic, and get to feel better about themselves in the end.\n \n Lastly, students would get to enjoy more of their summer. It would feel like this anyway because the student made project wouldnt really feel like a project. especially if it is a group project, it would just be like hanging with your friends in the summertime. and If you are a really eager student, you could get the project done in the first week or two of the summer then get to spend the rest of your time doing whatever you like to do during the summer.\n \n In conclusion, A student made project would be the best option for the students. Because the would get to enjoy their summer and learn a little at the same time. and in all they wouldnt feel obligated to such a chore during the summer.\n \n I hope you can understand why the student body should make their own projects for the summer and not teachers.",

    Essay: "A friend once said to me that summer is a giant break for us students to relax and recover from the stress of school. Some schools do require summer based projects during the break to keep us learning though. Sometimes these projects are teacher based or even student based. Teachers however, should not be designing summer based projects. Summer based projects should be student designed because students are more likely to enjoy them, it gives the students a chance to take action, and it helps give teachers insight on what they could do better.\n \n If students design the summer projects, they are more likely to enjoy and be more invested in them. One time in summer school, I was in a class where we were solving a mystery. The mystery however, was left open ended and did not really have an ending. I remember all my classmates being really upset. If students were involved in the creation of this activity, they could have made it have a more meaningful ending as to what students might have wanted.\n \n Next, Summer based projects should be fun for the students. They should be able to enjoy them without having to stress too much over them. Students are going to likely be moreÂ interested in the project if they create it themselves. Students might feel limited otherwise as to what they can do if it were a PowerPoint for example. There was a time where I wanted to do a drawing for a summer project, but my idea was rejected. I did not have as much fun with my project than I would have with my drawing.\n \n Last but not least, teachers could benefit and learn how to improve summer projects. Teachers often design he majority of what we do whether it be lessons, notes or even projects. Teachers could learn and observe how we may want to do the projects. My mom is a high school teacher and she often asks me for advice as to what might help students not just learn, but also have fun or not hate school even. Teachers could give out monthly surveys as a way to help them gain feedback. Summer projects could work in a similar fashion. Teachers should also give students more independence and time to work on large projects.\n \n Maybe some students in the past could have enjoyed school or summer projects more if they were student based. In the future, students should take the initiative and design more summer projects. Students should do this so they can get the most out of their learning. There might be some adults who say that students are just going to take advantage of them designing the projects and be lazy with it. However, students should learn how to do this kind of project based planning. It will help them be more independent and creative. Students should design summer projects so they can more likely enjoy them, help give teachers advice as to what they could improve, and it can help students mature.",

    Essay: "Some Schools want students to complete projects during the summer. These projects should be Student-designed because it will make students want to do them,ensure that they actually learn and it will help with their future. It could also set them up for collage or what they plan on doing after Highschool. Here are a few reasons i think the students should get to decide what their project is on.\n \n The first reason is, it will make them more interested. If students can pick their topic or even what they do they might actually want to complete it. A lot of times in School your projects may not be on something your interested in, which makes you not want to do it as much. If you can pick theres no way you wont be interested because you picked the topic. Also if they get to choose what they do as a project, for example community service, essay about someone or something, or doing an internship could be be great things for them to do but they will learn in a fun way.\n \n The next reason is it might help them with a future job. If someone were to do a project on something there interested in as a career it might help them decide if they want to do that. It will also open up possible jobs they didnt even know about but know have a chance to learn about. This could be really good for kids unsure about their future. This could even land them a job before they leave high schoolÂ which sets them up well for the future. It will set them up for collage also.\n \n The last reason would be good grades. In schools kids dont always get good grades. Part of the reason this happens is because their not interested in the topic. It can be hard to study something you dont like and do well on it. If the students made the choice they could pick whatever they wanted and could really have a good time doing this project. If students decided on their own project the teachers could really get an understanding of how that students actually preforms, not how they do in class on something the dont like.\n \n Allowing students to decide their project could really allow for them to show their true potential. This project will not only help kids be more interested in what thy are learning about it will also help with the future out of Highschool and maybe even their grades in school. In conclusion a Student decided project will benefit the kids the most.",

    Essay: "Often times, students disagree with and frown upon summer assignments, despite them helping to maintain their own educational growth.Â Many schools call for students to do projects over the summer to assure that they both have learned, and will continue to learn over the break. These summer projects should be designed by teachers, ensuring that: students actually learn something, students are being challenged, and that students' stress isn't piled up by them designing their own assignments.\n \n Teacher designed summer projects are needed because, if actually completed, they guarantee that the student will retain new information. Although not over-break assignments, DECA projects, which are designed by DECA executives, have produced countless intelligent people that can solve real world problems with ease. DECA is a national organization in which peers compete against one another through the creation of business solutions projects. Many students who have participated in DECA and have solved these types of issues,either come out of secondary education feeling confident about economics, or actually go into the business field. Projects like these teach students how to use whatever they are learning, in a non-classroom environment, ultimately boosting student growth.\n \n Assignments to be completed over the break are not meant to take away from the summer experience, but to challenge children enough to maintain and grow their educational ability. This purpose of summer assignments, is best suited by teacher modeling, because this presents a greater challenge to students. Some might argue that by students modeling their own projects, they are able to challenge themselves a great deal, without going over their personal limit. However, many young people will actually take advantage of being able to design their own assignments. For example, in my honors science classes, we would always have a year long, Science Symposium Assignment. In these assignments, me and a partner would design our own experiment and create a final trifold explaining the processes. Me and my partner always came up with the baseline knowledge experiments, so that we could earn a good grade without challenging ourselves. To this day, I do not recall the conclusions of those experiments, persuading me to believe if the teacher adminstered our project topics, we would have learned more.\n \n Students who are assigned such large projects are typically already stressed about the fact that they have to complete the project. Allowing the students to design their own projects would greatly increase their stress levels as they now remotely have two seperate assignments. My father, who is in the Army Special Forces, was once faced with this issue. As the leader of his team, he was instructed to find out where they would carry out a home invasion and how they would carry out the invasion. Normally, he would have already been told where to do it, and would just have to figure out how to do it. This put a lot of stress on him at this time, and actually led to a failed mission because his stress levels trumped is intelligence. Having to design your own methods for carrying out an assignment is detrimental to the outcome, for all types of people, especially students.\n \n Schools administering assignments similar to these, should be very cautious as to how they want the products to be done. It should definitley be made a priority that all projects are innovated by teachers in order to assure that the students are learning, reduce students' stress as much as possible, and to challenge and hold students accountable.Â  Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â",

    Essay: "My response is that I think that completing summer projects over the summer should be student-designed. When you take a long summer break, sometimes you can forget details you learned from schools because you have not been to school for so long. Also I think it is a good idea because doing this can give students more responsolities to have will they have fun during the summer.\n \n Another reason why I support this is because when student's don't go to school for so long they can forget alot of things in that time period. So a good way to keep their brain actively particapating in school things, should be the students doing projects over the summer. Also the students doing projects will help them for the next upcoming school year and their brain will already be warmed up. Another way this helps students is this prepairs them for the upcoming school year so the students wont be behind on things and they will be actively ready.\n \n My second supporting reason is that it's okay for students to take breaks, but they also should always be learning and doing things at the same time. I dont think the teachers should be doing school projects because they have already got their diploma's and knows what they are going to teach for the next year. But by the teachers giving us projects keeps us busy and more focused on school work. Also making students do projects can teach students alot of responsibilities, because doing these projects is like our job for example; when you work for an company and you don't do assignments when you have free time you can get fired for not taking responsibiity and doing what you are supposed to do, Students taking projects over the summer is simular to an actual job.\n \n The third reason on why I support my response is because students doing there projects helps them stay focus, consistant, and on task. If the teachers are doing the projects and the students are not actively learning on their summer break then they are not going to be prepared for the next school year. Also when the students are not learning for a long time, the students can get lazy and not want to do work because they are so used to going home and relaxing. By the students acting lazy and relaxing they won't start off with a good school year and can affect their grades and not stay focused. Also when a students is not actively learning, they can loose intrest in learning which can affect their behaivoir.\n \n Staying actively learning can help students tremendsly. It's very immportant for students to stay actively learning and not getting out of focus. When students stay actively learning and doing projects over breaks, it can impove your working and learning skills. All of these reason can help students in their school work and continuesly want to do work and do their responsibilites. These are my reasons on why i support students doing their projects over the summer.",

    Essay: "Schools deciding to give projects over the summer, should allow their students to design their own unique project. Teachers providing the project will most likely cause frustration in students. This could stem from a subject that is boring or they they do not like. Also, students do not want to spend all summer doing school work, so this will give students a more enjoyable learning experience. Requiring students to create their summer projects will allow students to enjoy their assignment, help them learn more efficient, and increase student responsibility.\n \n Letting students design their own summer project will give students a more enjoyable experience with their project. Most likely, students will choose a topic that they like. This motivates them to accomplish their project because they will want to learn more about their favorite food, theme park, or animal. If teachers were to pick students topics, then teachers would pick a plain boring subject. This would make students feel made to do it, which will decrease the chances of them finishing it. Also, doing a project on a hobby or favorite snack allows students to experiment with it to conclude valuable data. This gives students evidence to why they enjoy their hobby or favorite snack. Overall, allowing students to create their own project will create a better and more enjoyable atmosphere.\n \n Also, schools giving their students the right to create their own summer assignment helps students learn more efficient. More importantly, students that struggle to learn or focus will find these projects easier. It will also help them learn more and remember the information on the project. Students coming up with their own ideas gets them more excited, because they are not being forced to do their project on a topic they know anything about. This excitement to learn more about a topic creates a more efficient working environment, which helps students complete assignments. Also, students given summer projects by teachers will decrease the value of the project. Most students will find shortcuts or acquire help from a another student, sibling, or parent. However, students picking their own project will push them to gather the data on their own.\n \n In addition, allowing students to design their own summer project will increase responsibility. Most people have been given everything since they were born, whether that be food, a home, or as small as a homework assignment. Yet, this makes people dependent on people to do things for them. However, giving students the right to create and accomplish their own project establishes responsibility in their life. They have to come up with the topic, gather data, and be able to show it on a poster or power point, all while having to finish in a certain amount of time. Students grasping the importance of responsibility will only prepare them for college and a job. The people and students with it succeed more often, because they have good time management, do their job, and understand its importance.\n \n Having students create their own project, benefits them abundantly. It creates a better learning enviorment, while establishing importances in their life. Teachers creating the project for the students is no different from the school year students just faced. However, giving students some responsibility to accomplish a simple summer project is more than just a grade.",

    Essay: "Summer projects are dreaded by most students, despite the beneficial continuity in learning they provide during the otherwise schoolwork-free summer break. Such projects are only rewarding if they include information relevant to the corresponding course they were assigned for, making the idea of \"busy work\" both unecessary and hated by students (as is often the case in more open ended student-designed assignments). Teacher-designed summer assignments are far more effective than student-designed alternatives, as teachers can integrate necessary and prerequisite information for the course, the assignments are less open to interpretation and more focused, and students recieve an assignment that is both more impactful and less work-intensive.\n \n Teachers are well versed in their respective subjects, and have a good understanding of what information is necessary in order to succeed in a specific course. They are able to structure summer assignments in correspondence with key information, helping students start a course off strong. My AP Biology teacher illustrated such a well-directed summer assignment last year. She included information that was necessary for the transition into an AP science course, leading to the majority of the class being well-versed in key concepts by the beginning of the school year. This was reflected by the class average of an A in the first quarter. The alternative of a less directed student-designed project would lack the benefit of being structured by an individual knowledgable in key topics and would likely prove detrimental to both grades and overall understanding.\n \n More often than not, student-designed projects entail open exploration of a plethora of topics. While this can sometimes be beneficial, such open interpretation leads to less directed focus on the actual cirriculum, making the student-designed approach less effective than the teacher-designed counterpart. My computer science teacher assigned such a flawed project during this past summer, requiring students to merely explore and document anything computer related and create a project based on the findings. While such a project took student interest into account, it had little to no focus on the actual coding and programming cirriculum of the course. If my teacher had assigned us a project that required gaining a decent and basic understanding of code instead of an open ended exploration, we would have likely gained far more knowledge relevant to the course and a better idea of what the course's focus would be.\n \n Students already loathe the idea of doing work over the summer. Requiring students to not only complete a summer assignment, but forcing them to design it as well is both aimless and unecessary. Teachers designing these assignments with intentful structure makes the completion of the such projects less rigorous and more impactful, including the actual cirriculum of a given course without forcing the students to do any extra work in designing the project. Students want to enjoy their summer and not be weighed down by a huge project. Cutting down on unecessary work would make students and teachers alike happier, as students have less to do and teachers have less to grade, making teacher-designed projects the logical choice.\n \n Teacher-designed summer projects are more impactful than student-designed ones, as teachers have a good idea of what information is key for understanding of important concepts, they can narrow the focus of the project to aid in transition into the subsequent course, and they are less rigorous and more impactful. Students will appreciate the boost in understanding provided by a well structured teacher-designed project.",

Children love playing outside an enjoying their vacation time with their friends and family, away from school and stress. While some school find it beneficial to have students continue learning even over break. Thats why student-designed summer projects are perfect! In fact, they are more beneficial then teacher- designed summer projects because the students are more interested, they are willing to do it on their own, and it helps the community grow.\n \n Students having to do student-designed summer projects gets students more excited than having to do something that is forced. Students mostly like to do things that interests them and things that gets them excited to have fun and relax at the same time. For example, some students might like to do projects that involves being outside while others might enjoy projects where they can stay inside and can relax while working. With teacher-designed projects, the students are limited to do things they find amusing. Students are likely to do better when they are with their friends and are having fun. For example, students prefer group projects rather than individual projects because when they are working in a group they entire workload isn't on them.\n \n Students are willing to do things, that they find amusing, on their own. You won't see someone doing something they don't enjoy unless they are forced to. Summer projects are like subjects in school, some students are great at math but that doesn't mean they enjoy math. Summer projects are meant to help keep students on track but also enjoy their summer time with fun things. Many students, especially high school students, like to get summer jobs to earn some money before leaving for college. Some students like to work outside in the heat as a lifeguard while others like to work as a cashier in a fast food restaurant. No one is the same, everyone has their own interest and willingness to do things. Like that, some students might like working on summer projects that involves music but others might like projects that involves arts. Everyone has their own ways and choice of doing things.\n \n Lastly, student-designed projects helps the society grow. All these projects and programs help students decide what they really want to do in the future. Even though something might interest them right now, might be boring in the future. Students also learn many beneficial things from these projects, it can really help them grow and change into a better person. Some of these programs can even lead to future careers and jobs. For example, many students that do coding projects want to pursue computer science as their career while other students wanting to do art projects want to pursue theater as their career.\n \n Even though many may say that teacher-designed projects are more beneficial, it is not entirely true. teachers don't know their students interest as well as the students know themselves. Some students might be excellent at one subject but that doesn't mean that the subject interests them. Therefore, student-designed projects are much more beneficial them teacher designed projects and it interests the students more. Summer projects are meant to help students stay on track by learning but its also meant to be fun and amusing!Â",

As a student I've had plenty of summer projects, but they were always due within 2 months of school starting. Although some may say it would be for a student to make their own summer project , personally I think a project made by a teacher isn't a horrible idea. Teachers should design these assignments because, some student would try their best to do the bare minimum or their project would make absolutely no sense. The main idea of a summer project is to keep your mind active in those months of little to no brain activity. In the 9th grade i had a summer project for my AP world History class i was going to take the following school year, the project was designed by my teacher, it was a lot, but it prepared me for my AP class that next school year. Now I know that it could be easier on the students and the teacher, if a student were to make their own project, and it would teach students independence, along with learning how to manage your time wisely, and a teacher could spend more time working on the curriculum they have to teach. Teachers have always designed summer project, but maybe one day the students will get the opportunity to create their own project, however, it would be in it's best interest if teachers created a list of things they could and couldn't do for their project. Although I think teachers know the best way to create a project that is fit to prepare a student.Â",

    Essay: "Summer is supposed to be a time for students to take a break from learning, be able to go on vacation, and relax. Althought, summer is primarily for relaxation, schools don't want sudents to fall behind during those months, or forget what they learned in the previous year. Due to this, many schools have introduced summer projects for students to complete to build on what they learned and to prepare them for the upcoming year. Some schools allow for these projects to be student-designed, where others have made the teacher-designed. Summer projects should be teacher-designed to ensure students are learning based on what they need to know coming into the next year, allow for teachers to be able to help them easier, and give them the highest probability of suceeding in the upcoming year.\n \n Teacher designed projects would allow for student to have a baseline understanding of the information they need to know. During the summer going into sophmore year, I was assigned a summer project by my AP World History teacher. She gave us a very long project about 600bc, and I was not intrested at all. I worked on it all summer, and by the time school started, she began to teach the information I had learned in the summer. The project had made the first part of the corse a lot easier. I didn't struggle understanding the information because I already knew it. If I had picked my own project i don't believe I would have been as prepared to start a hard class like AP World History as much as I was because of my teacher-designed summer project.\n \n Along with preparing kids for new informtion they will need to understand, having teacher-designed summer projects would allow for the teacher to be able to help their student easier. If a student had a question about their project, and the student choose what it was on, the teacher may not know how to help because of the fact they didn't design it. It would make the teacher unsure of the direction the student may be taking with their project, and ultimetly making it difficult to help them. On the other hand, if the teacher had designed the project, they would know exactly how to help a struggling student because they took the time to create it and understand the ideas.\n \n Although having techers design the student projects, allowing for them to be student-designed would allow for more diverse and creative projects. Kids would be able to choose something that intrestes them verses having to do something assigned that they don't care about. The more a student is intrested and wants to learn about a topic, the more effort they are going to put into the project. With students choosing their project it would seem like less of a chore to do during their time off. It may also be benifitial for the teacher too see how their students work and how creative they are before the year is fully underway.\n \n Not only would schools having teacher-designed projects allow for students to grain helpful knowledge before the school year starts and have the highest chaces at succeding, but it would also help the teacher know how to help student that are struggling. Having student-designed projects may allow for more student creativity and intrest, but might be less benifitial in the long run. Schools should have teacher-designed projects during the summer to ensure maximum learning and ensure their students the best chances of succeding.Â",

    Essay: "Some schools require summer projects for students ; should these summer projects be student designed or teacher designed? Although teachers may not support student designed projects , the students would benefit from designing projects, by customizing it to their own liking and what they would want to do during summer vacation. Summer projects should be designed by students.\n \n If students designed summer projects they would enjoy the assignment much more. The assignment would not be a huge burden, but an activity that will be enjoyable and possibly exciting. Summer break should not be bothered by a teacher that designs a lousy project. Students could tweak the project and have fun designing and assigning the project, the project could be an activity they look forward to. The project could be less of an obstacle for students and less stress worthy. Ultimately Student designed projects could be an amazing experience for both student and teacher.\n \n Teacher designed projects may not be great for students, teachers sometimes assign too much work. Teachers may even overload students with work, students sometimes get thick packets and they do not want to do packet work during their vacation. Teachers may not think twice about what they assign, but most of the time the assignments are pretentious and bothersome. The projects should be designed so that it compliments the activities students do, such as assigning a projectÂ based on the sports they play.\n \n Summer vacation could be more enjoyable if students design summer projects. Teachers should let students design projects and guide them and encourage them on what to do and what not to do. Ultimately summer projects designed by students could be the best and most enjoyable aspect of summer vacation.",

    Essay: "Projects of any kind are often dreaded by most students, especially summer projects.Â Since some schools require these projects, the least they can do is make them student-designed.Â While there is less of a chance of the project being innapropriate or something easily put together last minute if it is teacher designed, it takes away so much of the students creative freedom. Summer projects should be student-designed because it allows them to do their project on something they are passionate about, they are given more creative freedom, and their classmates can learn new things instead of everyone doing their project on the same topic.\n \n With the load of school, extracurriculars, and homework students do not have nearly enough time to do things they are passionate about. Allowing students to pick their own summer project would give them the opportunity to learn more about something they love and get a grade on it. Additionally, if the project is about something that a student does not feel any sort of emotion towards, chances are, the student will not take as much time making it a great project because they do not care about the subject.\n \n When a student completes a project outside of school it could be a variety of things. It could be a painting, a clay pot, or even a table. All of those things require the student to be creative and make it their own. School projects should somewhat resemble these projects. Students should at the very least be given a chance to use their own creative skills to make the project their own, instead of them being given a list of things to include in a powerpoint. If the students' were allowed to pick their own summer projects they would have so much creative freedom to really do the best they could on their project and make it something they are proud of.\n \n Say there are around thirty kids in a class, and every kid has to present a project on the same topic. That is the same information rephrased thirty times, and that is over three class periods of sitting through essentially the same project thirty times. That is not something students would enjoy, and it is difficult to image that teachers enjoy sittting through all of those projects. Although, if every student in that class is allowed to pick their own topic that is thirty new topics that students in that class could learn about. Some of those topics might even peak other students' interests and they might try something new.\n \n In summary, summer projects should be student-designed because they can do a project on something they are passionate about, they are given more creative freedom, and their classmates can learn something new. These projects need to be student-designed or they will continue to be insufferable projects to do and sit through that are dreaded and procrastinated throughout the entire summer.",

    Essay: "The answer is so astoundingly obvious, the projects should be student-designed.\n \n I believe that the projects students are required to do over the smmer should be student-design rather than teacher-designed for countless reasons.\n \n It is less work for the teachers them selves.\n \n Students would be allowed to work on their creative mind.\n \n Students become more inclined to do them this way.\n \n First of all is a simple reason that it is less work for the teachers.\n \n Instructors already have plenty of work to do over the summer, some teach summer school and have to grade papers. Even teachers that do not teach summer school still have plenty of work to do like getting ready for the next school year.\n \n On top of that they have their own adult homes lives to deal with.\n \n When you add more work like planning a summer project for all your students to do and maybe even having to come up with multiple, I feel that is not necessary.\n \n The next argument I propose is that the students will be able to express their creativity.\n \n The projects teachers give out are, nine times out of ten, not exciting at all, mostly boring.\n \n When students are able to come up with their own projects it gives us a sense of creativiy as well as making it more enjoyable.\n \n We can put our interests into the project: gaming, anime, reading, sports, hiking, fishing, etc. It also gives us a sense of ownership over the entire thing rather than it being another boring, school issued, manditory assignment.\n \n My final act of persuasion will be that students would be more inclined to do the projects.\n \n Summer is a time we don't want to think about school, it is a 3 month time period we can sit back and relax or focus on more important things than if our homework is done.\n \n Students tend to wait till the last minute and sometimes not do them at all.\n \n While, yes, some people may say, \"They could do the project anyway over summer if it's something they want to do whether it's issued or not so why have it be school issued.\"\n \n That is where you are wrong, you see, kids around my age such as thirteen to eighteen are known to be gargantuate procrastinaters.\n \n We may want to do something over the summer and might find it cool but more than likely we won't end up doing it.\n \n If the subject at hand is required then we would have the drive to actually do it rather than loiter, and since we crated it and find interest in it we would most likely do the project early on and efficiently.\n \n In conclusion to this exactly three thousand charcater persuasive essay, I believe that the projects students are required to do over the smmer should be student-design rather than teacher-designed.\n \n It gives instructors less work.\n \n Students get to express their creativity and interests.\n \n Students would be motived and have more push to do the project. It is assenine to think otherwise since my argument is astronomically superior to any arguement that could be mustered for the projects to be teacher-designed.

    Essay: "There are over 1,000 students who are required to complete summer assignments. There are the ones who do complete the summer assignments and the ones who do not complete the summer assignments. Many believe that the summer assignments are to difficult to complete and even question if the summer assignments should really be teacher-designed or changed to make it student-designed. However, others believe that they should keep the summer assignments the way they are and keep it teacher-designed and not make it student-designed or else it would be to easy. With all of this information in mind, the summer assignment should be teacher-designed because they make people think on how a problem should be solved, they make them ready for a challenging situation, and they help people retain lost information.\n \n One reason to have the summer assignments teacher-designed, is so people think about how a problem is solved. Teacher-designed summer assignments ask difficult questions to help students not to make student think that they can not do the summer assignment. This helps students by making them think instead of giving them a simple multiple or addition question. It challenges the mind and creates a path of emotions along the way; but when people finish, it is the most satisfying thing in the whole universe. Then afterwards, being able to share the experience with people, makes others want to do it to or do something more complex. Having teachers design problems, that make people think, can change people's life. This is true for one girl, named Generic_Name, who had a teacher give her a summer assignment that for math. As she was doing the summer assignment, she found a question that was difficult and complex to the point where she didn't understand how to do it. However, she decided she would figure it out and complete the summer assignment, in which she did, by using the formula and topics she already knew and by looking some stuff up, she was able to complete the question and get a perfect score on her summer assignment.\n \n Having a teacher-designed summer assignment can make people ready for a Challenging situation. By completing the summer assignments, it shows that some students can handle challenging and complex problems and situations. Some of the problems on a summer assignment could be seen in the real world; so by finishing those problems it makes people ready for success in the real world. For example, If a teacher were to give a student a summer assignment dealing with math, and one of the questions on the assignment was complex and difficult but that student was able to figure it out from past knowledge, then when the student is an adult and ends up seeing that question again the student would be able to figure it out and would get the satisfaction of completing it. So even if a problem is challenging on a summer assignment, completing it and getting the right answer will make people successful in the future.\n \n In contrast to that, there are people who end up solving the difficult problems and go through the challenges of a summer assignment, but they either never end up using that advantage or just forget it altogether. However, there are people who never forget the problems on a summer assignment because writing it and doing the problem without cheating or giving up helps people remember the problems. Completing the summer assignment also helps people retain information for the following school year. For some students once the school year is over they forget everything they learned and end up having to catch up once they get back in school. But having teacher-designed summer assignments helps students get the information they need to know for the following school year not just random information from several years ago.\n \n With teacher-designed summer assignments, students would do fantastic throughout the school year than if they were given student-designed summer assignments. They would be able to accurately use the information they have and think about the problems. They would be able to experience the difficulty of the problems and experience the satisfaction of completing a complex problem. They also would be able to bring back forgotten information that they need for the following school year or for their future. So having a teacher-designed summer assignment rather than a student-designed summer assignment would be better; not just for students, but teachers as well.",

    Essay: "Summer projects should be designed by teachers and not the students. First off, when a student is on summer break, they usually don't want to do any more work than they have to, and making students design their own projects would make them less likely to complete the project. Second, a teacher designing the projects would mean that the accuracy of the project would better help the students learn as well as make the students more likely to complete the project before school starts.\n \n When a student has to design their own project, that gives the student more work than necessary for a summer assignment. If a student is given too much freedom with the project they are more likely to procrastinate and forget about the project. For example, a student has to design their own project over the summer, but they have no idea what they should do. The student would then decide that they would figure it out later and forget about the assignment. Another reason, is that a student could be going out of town for vacation, and they wouldn't have the time to design their own project while on vacation.\n \n Another reason teachers should design summer projects, is so that students can have detailed guidelines for their projects and learn all necessary information over the summer. If students are left to make their own project, then they are most likely going to do the minimum amount of work and gain very little of what they could be learning. If a teacher designs the project, then they could include everything that the student needs to learn for the upcoming school year while still giving the studnents a reasonable amount of work over the summer. For example, a student on vacation wouldn't have time to design and complete their own project, but if there are clear guidelines for the project, the student could complete the project around their vacation schedule.\n \n Some people might disagree by saying that creativity would help the students in the long run, and while I beleive that creativity is a good thing, I also beleive that giving students an actual break over the summer could do a lot of good. This doesn't mean I think that students should have no work to do over the summer, but I do think that less is better in this case. The \"creativity\" that the students would be missing out on could easily bee made up during school hours, giving the students some breathing room over the summer.\n \n Overall, I beleive that summer projects should be designed by the teachers, not by the students. Doing so would give the students enough work over the summer to actually retain information, but still giving them the break that they deserve. It would also give the students guidlines to work from, so that they may complete the assignment before any vacation plans that might prevent them from doing so.",

    Essay: "The idea that summer projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed. Should be student-designed cause for the whole school year teachers have assigned papers and projects that they think is a good idea which some of them are, but some of them are confusing and hard to some students.\n \n As a student I feel as if we should come up with our own project, especially that some students want to be teachers one day get a head start on how to come up with aÂ project for their students for the future. For example students may use their teachers project that they assigned them and put a twist on it something that is fun to work on,but teachers and some students think that it should be teacher-designed cause some students have a mindset and think teachers have been giving out projects all year why stop now. Which is a lazy mindset students should want to make their own project. One student might just go as far and say why can't it be both and the teachers and the students come up with a project and combine it which is great but as students get told to do these assignments and projects from their teacher and they are specific projects with a rubric there isnt much a student can do but go by what they are told from the rubric, no brainstorm ideas just get an A and go by the rubric. It should be student-designed cause students have their own ideas and what they can do to make a project better and look appealing you get a project from a teacher and a rubric and you are going off not what you think but the rubric what the teacher wants so every student is doing that, thats why all projects look the same and have the same idea and concept. Teachers argue that it should be teacher-designed because the students are going to do something thats not important like video games or sports not about academics and that is a valid argument, however how do they know what the students are going to do that if they don't get to make their own project. Teachers may say because it is the summer students won't do the project cause there have been assignments where they are given over the weekend and the students still won't do them so if they give the students a project over the summer they will defiantly not get it done which is false that project will be 60% of your grade for the new school year who doesn't want to start out with a perfect grade at the beginning of the year? some students will forget over the summer yes but when the school year is about to begin send an email to a parent or on the remind app so when the students do come back they are ready to present. I would like to see what students come up with and how they would present it students should be able to do summer projects with their rubric that they came up with and doing these student-designed projects will help them with aÂ careerÂ and a job where they need to brainstorm and think of their own ideas instead of getting the exact directions handed to them. It also takes the stress off the teacher in thinking of a summer project, before the end of the year a student-designed project would be good and would benefit the students greatly.",

    Essay: "Some schools, require students to complete school related projects during holiday/seasonal break. Teachers, who give their students assignments to be completed during break are more likely create; a more educated student, responsable student, and a more ambicous student.\n \n Teachers who assighn students work during holiday/seasonal breaks, are more likely to have greater test scores from students than teachers who don't assighn work to be completed during break. Study's show that teachers who assighn work during breaks are likely to have better test and quiz grade outcomes, do to students gaining extra practice and gaining more information on a unit that had prevously been taught before break. For example, students who complete assghnments that their teacher had assghined them to do and be completed during break have more study time which students gain more information and knowledge about the unit then a student who dosn't have work assghined to them, meaning students gain extra information and knowledge that they can use during test, quizzes, and class work when comming back from break do to teachers giving them work sheets to be complete at home making them more educated students.\n \n Secoundly, students who are given work during holiday/seasonal break and complete the work that their teacher has assighned them, will become more responsable students. For instance, students who are assighned work and know that their work has to be completed by a certain Date and time, tend to focus on what's really improtant such as their grade in class. Students, know that completing the work on time and at the best of there abilty know that they will gain a good grade in the gradebook and will have a better grade in the classroom as well, But the students also know if the assighnments are not fully completed and on time that there consiquence maybe there grade will drop drastically due to them not completing the task their teacher has assighned forthem. Making the students that where assigned projects to be completed during break, more responsable then other students.\n \n Furthmore, Teachers who have assighned projects to be completed during break are creating ambicous students, and not lazy students who dont want to do class work and assighnments during class time when it becomes time to come back from break. for exmaple,students know that they will be returning back to school when break is over causes students to not loose their focus for school and the their class work when time to come back to school and remembering that holiday/seasonal breaks are just breaks from the school envioment and from fellow class mates that you have been stuck with for a long time period of time. meaning this will cause students to understand that they will be returnng back to schoola nd when they do it will be back to the basic and usaul clas room setting, work, test and quizzes. students who analyize this thought in there mind while doing there work assighned to them on break will not become lazy students that don't want to do anything when they return back to school but instead cause a more ambicouse student who is willing to exceed expectaions from their teachers and their class work.\n \n Summer projects that are assighned by and from teachers are tottaly nessacesary if you want more educated students, responsable students, and a more ambicouse students in your class room.\n \n ;",

    Essay: "Ring! the final bell has rung its now officially summer. Though there is still school work to be done, teachers have designed a summer assignment to complete. Although some may believe otherwise teachers should design summer projects because they know what they want students to learn and keeps students mind in shape\n \n Your grocery shopping, and you discover you need milk. You know what milk you need to buy. Teachers are the same way over summer assignments. Teachers know what they want students to learn over summer. Learning the material a teacher assigns over summer ensures that the student will be ready for the upcoming class in the fall. It also keeps the students busy with work. If students didnt work they wouldnt be successful in life. An example is Mark Zuckerberg, he created Facebook. Mark had a dream about a giant social media platform that you can share things with anyone and keep in touch with friends all over the world anywhere and anytime. The next day Mark started Facebook from his basement. He went everywhere to get investors to invest in Facebook. The dream happened Facebook is currently the leading social media platform for millions of people. He wouldnt be where he is if he didnt work. Students should follow in his footsteps. Students should learn what teachers assign them, and be inspired to learn and work. Who knows maybe they will have the next big idea that will change the world.\n \n Have you ever went to the gym and worked really hard and woke up the next morning barley being able to move. Your mind is the same way. It has to constantly be learning and reviewing to keep information. This helps teachers when assigning summer assignments. When school starts after the break students are familiar with topics from the assignment. If students dont do or review the assignment they will lose some of the learning they acquired from the past school year. This can happen to anyone, It has happened to me. I forgot to do my summer assignment during my freshman year. I walked into the first day of school clueless. I was lost and confused. Nothing made sense to me. It was almost like my teacher was speaking a entire differentÂ language. Now I make sure I do them so Im ready to learn on the first day. In addition, my friend Generic_Name she did her summer assignment. she had a pop quiz on the very first day of school. She got a 82%, if she didnt do her assignment she would have gotten a bad grade. Students should do the assignments teachers gives them. It keeps students from forgetting information, and students can even learn brand new information students have never learned before.\n \n Some may say students should design summer projects because they know what they want to learn. About 67% of students have been over worked in the past year. This shows that students needs a break over summer.\n \n They have completed 9 months of school non stop. Students don't want to learn anything else. Its now summer all they want is a break. They want to go hang out with friends, travel, etc. An example of this is my friend Generic_Name, She took 3 advanced placement classes in the past school year. She was in school for 7 hours a day and did homework for another 9 hours by herself. When summer hit all she did was relax and not stress over the work or test she would always have to rush and complete the next morning. She did 16 hours of school every day for 9 months. Shes not going to do any school work over summer, shes doesn't want to learn anything, all she wants is a break. If the summers projects were up to the students like Generic_Name the only assignment they would assign is to relax. As a result, she will most likely forget information she learned from the past year and put herself in more stress and work.\n \n Teachers know what they want for students, and they design an assignment that helps students minds stay in shape. Students should embrace teachers assignments. They could really help a students future. They keep students busy. They help with not forgetting all the hard work students did in the past year. Teachers assignments are vital in summer its a teacher job to design them.Â",

    Essay: "You may not know, but schools have been requiring students to complete summer projects so they can still continue to learn over summer break. You probably wondering now like, why would they do that, but thats not the question. This individual have to explain should the projects contain the teacher designing them or the students designing them. As one, the projects should contain the students designing them because some students like to use their own creativity, when you come up with your own things,accomplish the and do good on it, that make a person feel good about their self, may want to come up with your own soÂ people can use the material that's already at home. yes, some people may think that the teacher should design and some people may think that student should design them, but as one, this essay will contain it being the students designing their own projects.\n \n Well, here will talk about how people like to use their own creativity. For example, I know a female that like to draw, shes very creative and she always drawing on her spare time. If her teacher does not have as much creativity as she does it would not be no fun for her. If the teacher was to design the projects she would not to get to use her creativity as much as she would like. Do not get me wrong she will use it even if her teacher was to design the projects she will not use as much as she would if she was to sit down and think of a design herself. If she can sit down and think of one herself then she can fully use her creativity and then she will have more fun doing the project because she can come up with her own idea.\n \n This specific paragraph will talk about how when people come up with their own ideas and accomplish them, it make them feel good about themselves and it pushes them to do more. If someone had to write a three page paper and had to turn it in by the end of summer break and they plan on having it done by the end of June and they accomplish that goal, its going to make them proud and make them feel good about their selves. Yea, some people may say otherwise such as they only did it because they had no choice and it was grade, but thats not true because people always have a choice. They did it because they wanted to accomplish their goal that they set and they did that. Im pretty sure no students wants to go on summer break and do a project or work because that suppose to be our time off from school. That's our only long break that we get to have.\n \n Last reason contains wanting to pick your own project so people can just use the materials that they have at home instead of going to the store and having to but some materials. For example, if a person was to have supplies to do the project that they want to do and the teacher say, \"i'm going to pick your projects\". Then she give someone a project that you do not have none of the material for and the that person have to go out and spend their precious money on a project. Instead, this is y this should contain students designing their own projects and then that person can just pick a project they already got the materials for.\n \n Finally we reach the end of this confident essay. Some people will not agree to what this person said and some people may agree to what this person said. This person is not here to worry about who agree with her or not she just want to leave her opinion and how she feel about the question. With all that being said, these are this ones reasons to why she think that the school summer projects should be student designed and not teacher designed.

    Essay: "I agree that some schools should let students do summer projects sometime over the summer. My main reasons are: staying active, not being lazy, and keeping your brain and yourself on track . During the summer you should want to go out and enjoy the outside world, you can do other things as well and to be creative about things for your school summer project, other than staying indoors and deciding to only sit around and do nothing.\n \n First, the reason I said to stay active is because when you are outside you never know what you will find or discover if you are doing a project, or just simply exploring the world or the envoirment you live in. Discovering new things helps you think about nature and physical activity that is happening all around you. If you are doing a specific project, then maybe you should look for certain things outside, or even think about what would be great to add on to your project. Stay focused and try to look forward into new things that you see for your summer project.\n \n Secondly, for my reason of not being lazy is mostly saying that instead of being at home watching television commercials, or being on your phone all the time, maybe even just sitting and play video games is way worse than enjoying yourself. You could be missing so much fun things that are just waiting for you to explore with outside. It could be new animals you never seen before, something interesting that you might want to experience or hanging with friends. They can even help you on your project to if you want them to join as well. Don't just sit around and put boring things on your project, or words that dont make any since to you or the topic of the project. You want to be creative with your ideas think positive about finding new things and most importantly ,have fun with what you are doing.\n \n Although, you might not be lazy but you must have your brain and yourself on track at all times. School projects are made for you to have fun while doing them, and to meet new people if you are working in groups , or even if you are by yourself and still have positive thoughts for you and your project then everything its going just fine. You must make sure that you feel comfortable to do your school project and to have all the things you need to make your project creative, strong, and well written. Over the summer, you want to go places to enjoy your self and not to sit around and be off tasks all day long.\n \n This section might be a little off topic but I just wanted to say , whatever you do over your summer break is up to you. You can be outside having fun or maybe even inside as well enjoying yourself. Some people would not like to do a creative project outside sometimes but that is okay as well because you can do your project inside too. A lotÂ of times, projects can be for fun or just to be graded when you come back to school. While you are doing your project, it helps you learn more over the summer break and you become interested to do certain things over the break and thats fine to. Being creative is another way of saying, you got this no matter what.\n \n In conclusion, have fun with your project. Don't be afraid to do anything with your project that mainly talks about you or what you like to do in your life. Doing projects makes kids want to do them more over time, and then they might just might, be able to describe many things specifically for their projects. Learning on the other hand, makes you think more than just to not think at all. Just remember, while you are doing these projects once again you must continue to have fun with them. Tell about your life, family, or other and to have a great summer as well.",

    Essay: "Over the years teachers have been assigning summer projects. Imagine if students were able to design their own projects for summer break. Some people say students designing their own work will teach them time management. Others say teachers designing summer work will give students a challenge. Summer projects should be teacher designed because students will be more challenged, teachers are more experienced, and students will not be focused. Teachers designing work will benefit students more than students designing work would.\n \n Initially, teachers should design summer projects because students will be challenge. Students will want to take the least amount of time doing school work in the summer, so they will design a project that can get done fast with no effort. When teachers design summer projects they give enough work that will keep students learning throughout the whole break. For instance, teachers design summer projects with day by day sections, so students can not rush through it all in one day. To keep students working through the whole summer teachers are the best at designing summer projects.\n \n Some people may argue that summer projects should be student designed because it teaches students time management. Students need to be able to manage their time accordingly and experience critical thinking skills for future references. Despite these reasons, summer projects should be teacher designed because students tend to lose focus during big projects. Students being on summer break will result in them focusing on what is more fun rather than their school work. Teacher designed projects will assure that students are focused on getting the task done.\n \n Second, summer projects should be teacher designed because teachers have more experience. Teachers know students will wait until the last minute to try to come up with a quick project. Teachers will already have a summer project ready before summer break, so students will not have an excuse to why they could notÂ finish the project. Additionally, teachers already know what skills everyone struggles with. When returning back to school teachers will not have to struggle to reteach a skill. The topic that is chosen for students to complete over the summer will benefit students for the upcoming school year. Teachers designing summer projects will benefit the students more than students designing summer projects.\n \n In conclusion, summer projects should be teacher designed because students will be more challenged, teachers are more experienced, and students will not be focused. Students will try to get the easy way out if they are able to pick their own work. Teachers know what is best for students during their summer break. They can provide tips to help students along the way and assure students stay focused on their assignment. Teachers designing summer work will give students more time to enjoy summer rather than stressing over what to do as an summer assignment.",

    Essay: "Does your school require a summer project? Would you rather be able to choose the subject of said project? If a student chooses their subject they would most likely: not get bored, enjoy the project, and get a better grade. If a teacher assigns a summer project with a specific topic that the student wouldn't want to talk about, would make the summer a bore.\n \n If the student chooses their topic it will be something they have interest in, therefore they will enjoy doing the project. If they enjoy the project they won't get bored, and if they don't get bored then there will be a better finished product rather than the rushed, I don't want to do this, procrastinated project that the teacher would get if it was on a topic set by the teacher.\n \n In the end, if the student picks their topic, there will be a better outcome for everyone. Every student wants the freedom of being able to do something they enjoy in school. If everything you do in school is what the teacher wants then the students will get bored, therefore getting lazy and making the teacher look bad. We don't want teachers to look bad, because we as students need them in order to better our lives, so therefore a summer project should be on a topic the student picks.",

    Essay: "Imagine being a student on summer break and still letting your teacher decide what project you are doing, would you want that? While some may say that teacher designed projects over the summer time are better, I disagree with that statement. Letting students make their own projects for summer lets them have more creativeness, it makes the project easier on them, and could lets them enjoy their projects a lot more since they dont have to follow some guidelines. I know I would want to have a student designed project especially since its summer time. When students get their own student designed project it lets them have more creativeness, easier projects, and lets them have more fun with their project.\n \n When a student gets to design his or her own project it lets them be creative which will lead to a better project. Creativeness leads to great things, something that is emphasized by almost every teacher. In addition, a student project that is designed by them is the science fair and some amazing projects come out of that every year. When you are stuck following guidelines their is not much to do with your project, when I had to make my own project I got an A+ on it. Creativeness leads to overall better projects, which teachers will like more.\n \n Students making there own project lets them have an easier time with the project. They know the own guidelines and rules since they designed the project. I know when I was in this situation I benefited a lot from letting me make my own guidelines to follow make the project easier for me to do. When the project is easier that gives me more motivation to do it, so all my time spent on the project is productive. Students benefit a lot when they are doing something that comes easy to them.\n \n While making your own project it lets you enjoy your time working on the project. Working on a project where you are having fun and enjoying yourself is a much better experience than just slugging it out. Their is a saying that \"time flies when you're having fun,\" that could apply to the project too. When Im having fun it leads to better results and a less amount of work time. Also, why would a teacher not want you to have fun while you're on summer break.\n \n Some could argue that teacher designed projects are better due to them being more structured and proper. Student designed projects are still the better option, when a student is creative it leads to an overall better project. They also have an easier time with the project, which leads to more motivation to do the project and get it over with. Also , actually enjoying the project leads to an overall better and less amount of work time. Student designed projects are the way to go because, it lets them be creative, makes the project easier, and lets them enjoy their time working on the project. Â Â Â Â",

    Essay: "If schools are giving students projects to do over the summer, then the projects should be student-designed. I would imagine giving students summer projects to be a pain for them, since many students are taking a long break away from school and have probably made plans to do things with their family and friends, but if they were to be given projects that can come up with on their own, students would continue to learn about the lessons that their teachers had given them, the project alone would increase their creativity, and school counties will be able to see how much information they have taken in over the entire school year.\n \n Although students coming up with their own assignments to do for the summer project would increase their learning abilities, have trouble thinking of their own project and how they're going to make it. Not only that but teachers assigning the project to their students would be a bit easier than students having to look up a topic and figure out what to do on their own. I know that sometimes having to figure out what you are going to figure can be a bit challenging, especially if you dont know what the topic of the project is, but having a teacher assign the project to you would be less frustrating because they can tell you what you do and do not have to do or what you need before you leave for summer break.\n \n Students being given assignments by teacher would also be a terrible option due to the fact that said student would not be able to be as creative as he/she wants to and they would not be able to do the topic that they wanted to do. For example, a teacher talks about the summer-project and he/she would assign them to do the project on something history related. It wouldnt exactly be fair to any of the other students in the classroom who dont want to do the topic in what their teacher gave them. Having to do the project alone during their break would already be a pain, but i think if the student had created something related to what they wanted to do, then it could make them more inspired, and motivated instead of giving them something that theyre not even interested in, which is exactly why i think student-designed summer projects would be the better option.",

    Essay: "Some schools require students to complete projects over summer to assure they continue learning during the break. The school is thinking of adopting that rule and the principal is trying to decide if these summer projects should be designed by teachers or students. It would be best if the principal made these projects designed by teachers in order to make sure the projects are decently sized, factually correct, informative, and easy to understand and grade.\n \n Some people say that if students were to make the projects, the projects would be kept at a good size because the students know better than everyone else what would be a fair, challenging project and the teachers would make the project overly long or short. However, since teachers are designing the project, they will focus on making the project not overly large because making a longer project means more grading for the teachers, while also not making a overly brief project because it will fail to keep the students learning and informed over summer break. If the students were to make the project they might feel compelled to make the project short and easy for the sake of less work.\n \n Since the teachers are well informed on the subjects of the projects and know what the students need to learn or retain over summer break, they would be the best choice to make a project that is factually correct and informative. If students were to design these projects, they would be a greater chance of factual or grammatical error in the project, which is really damaging and will be hard for the teacher to reteach and correct.\n \n The teacher is in charge of giving out grades to students and will format their assignments and projects so they are easy to grade. If the students were to create the summer projects, the teachers would have to figure out a rubric to grade the projects and judge how much the project should weigh on the students' grade, which can take quiet a bit compared to if the teachers just made the projects themselves.\n \n The teachers are better at making sure the project for many reasons: they are better at formatting, they make less errors, and they'll make the project meatier than a student would. Think about this; what if you were assigned a summer project for science that was intended to keep you well informed, but was overly brief, wasn't as well formatted as it could have been, had a confusing or nonexistent rubric, and had potential factual or grammatical errors. Would you want the students to make the project for the sole reason that they're students or would you take the paid, professional teacher? In short, the principal should make the summer projects designed by teachers.",

    Essay: "There are schools that sometimes encourage or require teachers to assign a project over summer break. This is beneficial because it keeps the student actively learning. Sometimes when students come back after having a long period of break, and if they did not kept actively learning, it can be difficult to get back on track. If schools were to assign summer projects for the students, I think that it would be more beneficial for the project to be student-designed, because students have more control over the level of difficulty, more creativeness, and it can motivate them to do it.\n \n When students have more control over the level of difficulty, they can decide how challenging the project should be. There are times when teachers have handed out activities, projects, or classwork where they can be a bit too challenging or stressful for some students. For example, I was once given an assignment in history, where I had to research a topic and then write five pages maximum. This was hard for me, because it was a big jump as to what I would usually write, and over time it just ended up stressing me and I felt as if I really did not gain much information out of it. However, when in another class we were given a year-long project that was student-designed, I learned so much more and had a better experience. Even though we did also make the project challenging, it was not too overwhelming for al. We had a better opinion as to how much we were capable of without it becoming overwhelming and stressful. When students decide how challenging the project should be for them, it can help them learn better and actually apply the new learned knowledge, compared to when teachers decide.\n \n If projects were student-designed, the students have a better chance of being more creative and expressing better. Nobody really likes to do tasks that are boring for them, or where their creativity is tight. I once had a science project where I was allowed to be creative, and since that was the case I not only learned and understood the information better, but my grade improved as well. There are many times, that I have proved that when the projects were created by the students, students learned much more because they liked it and they could express themselves better. Sometimes when teachers limit their students, it can become very stressful an unpleasantÂ for the students. Not many can successfully learn and grow in an environment like that.\n \n Summer break is supposed to be fun vacations and a stress-free time period; yet, it students should still be actively learning during the break. However, if projects are assigned, then students should be allowed to create them themselves in order to make them more fun. When projects, or even simple task can be made in a fun way, it can be less stressful and more enjoyable. That way, many more students would be more motivated to actually do the project and put effort into it. When there is motivation, and things are done thoroughly, the ending results tend to reflect that. For example, when students have to study for a test, and they are given study guidesÂ with just questions it really does not help motivate some students to study. Unlike when students who use different study tools, such as games or more interactive activities, this makes the task more fun and wanting to put effort.\n \n When projects are fun and more creative, students can learn, understand, and apply the information better. Learning over the break can also be helpful so when returning back to school, they have retained the old information, yet have learned new one too. I think that projects that are student-designed are more successful than teacher-designed projects, because students can decide the level of difficulty fit for them, there is more creativeness, and it can be more effective and motivational.Â",

    Essay: "It's the last day of school, you're sitting in your desk leg bouncing anxiously waiting for the final bell to ring. That bell of freedom, but just a minute before it rings your teacher reminds the class of the most dreaded thing on the planet, the student summer project.\n \n Everybody groans in disdain, but the feeling of dread is washed away with the final chime of the squeaky high pitched freedom cry. You're now a month into your three month summer break and your project pops into your mind, but is brushed off quickly with the though of \"I'll do it later\". More time goes by, one month, then the next. Now its four days before the first day of school and you're laying in bed thinking \"oh this is bad\". This happens to students almost everywhere you look on earth, Massive procrastination that doesn't end until its too late. How do we curb this? I believe the best option is the Teacher Designed Summer Project, TDSP for short, and here's why.\n \n My First reason for thinking the TDSP is better than the SDSP(student designed summer project) is that students can be just flat out lazy. Using myself as an example, I am a very lazy student. I dont turn things in on time, whenever I do turn things in on time normally they're haphazardly put together and not very cohesive. I know that if our school were to have a SDSP many students, myself included, would not get them done because we believe we have many better things that we could be doing with our time, or we just do not want to do it. If these projects were headed up by a teacher, it would help direct the many students like me.\n \n My next reason on why the TSDP is better is that many students dont know what they want to do with their life once they leave high school. With the help of a specialized TDSP teacher and or counselor, the students can be lead to something that they genuinely enjoy, instead of something that makes them want to pull their hair out every day. A specialized TSDP teacher would know their students and their aspirations in life and can help them form ideas and keep them on the right track through the three months.\n \n My final point on why the TDSP is better, which tacks onto my last point, is that it could encourage kids to pursue something that they love and take charge of their future. With the help of a TDSP teacher, students like me could start to find a calling in life, something that we genuinelyÂ enjoy and want to keep doing. That's not something that would happen with students like me if we had no direction.\n \n There are some drawbacks to the TDSP however. The first reason would be it might put more stress on the students in a time where we are supposed to be relaxing from school work to take time for ourselves. The second drawback is that it would put more strain on the school system to pay certain TDSP teachers through the summer, and it would also take precious summer time away from those said TDSP teachers. The third drawback would be that it is catered towards people who are somewhat lazy, restricting the students that are not to a bound path.\n \n It's hard for me to admit that, being one of the students that believes that summer projects are horrible, I still believe that the teacher lead summer project is the best route to go. It keeps students on track with the school, you form a tighter bond with aÂ teacher, and you start to figure out what you want to do on this big blue sphere. Many students will not like it at first, and they wont want to give it the light of day, But they'll cone around. It pains me to say that, even though it would be taking away from my precious summer time, I believe that the Pros of the TDSP out way the cons and that it might just be the solution to our problems.Â  Â  Â",

    Essay: "During the summer, students receive projects to ensure that they continue to learn outside of school. Usually there is a strict rubric to follow, but many people argue that it would be more beneficial if they were able to design their own project. As a student, I believe that having more freedom with our summer projects would bring out our work ethic. People don't often respond well to a list of rules they are told they must follow. We would be a lot more receptive to things made for and by us. Students would have an easier and better time with a project where they are not limited and can express their creativity .However, some people might prefer having a teacher-designed project over a student-designed project, because it tells them exactly what to do and how to do it. I understand that to a degree, but outside of doing projects that's how everything else is. Worksheets, quizzes, and tests are all rule driven. We don't get to choose how we want to do them, because they are already made a certain way. In my opinion, it doesn't leave much to the imagination which is one of the most important parts of doing a project.Â When we are put in a box it takes the enjoyment out of the project, and we don't try as hard.\n \n I have done many summer projects over the past couple of years, and I have noticed that the projects with the most rules and standards were the ones I worked on last minute. I did not find them interesting, because I was forced to do exactly what the paper said. I personally enjoy having to come up with my own themes, and using whatever material or format that I wish to use at the time. One of the best parts of a project is the design. We get to make it look the way we want it. Unlike regular school work we can pick the color, the fonts, and the format. During the 9 months we are in school we are required to do work we don't necessarily want to do. Summer is our time to relax, and if we are still needed to do this work than it should be something we want to do. Expression is a big thing for my age group. If you make a project more expression and creativity based, kids will automatically be more drawn to it. I definitely was during my last project.\n \n I attend the Center for the Arts program at Generic_School and one of the most creative projects I've ever done was for my Musical Theater class last year. We had to make a video or a PowerPoint about ourselves and present it for the rest of class. I made a PowerPoint that included some special things in my life, like my best friend and also included some videos or us joking around. I really loved that project, because everyone had a different presentation. No two were the same. We all learned new things about each other, and that's how some of us became friends. We found out each others interests and what we had in common. One kid in my class even wrote a song about himself and preformed it for us. We all had the chance to express ourselves, which made the project so exciting. Creativity is very important to me, especially in my program.\n \n It would be really beneficial if we gave other kids, outside of the center, this opportunity as well. It challenges them and shows how creative everyone can be.\n \n Another downside to teacher-designed project is that teachers often use some of the same projects over again. For example; I have done the same summer project for my English classes for the past two or three years. We were required to read three books and write excerpts about each. It wasn't a difficult endeavor, but it would've been so much more enjoyable to make a video or a presentation about the book rather than a quick summary. We also didn't get to pick the books we were given. The first year, I was lucky enough to have received\n \n The Outsiders which is now my favorite book. However, the year after, I was given\n \n Animal Farm which\n \n I did not find interest in at all. The rest of my class tended to agree with me. Overall I think that was not a good book to give to our age group. Usually it is a hit or miss when it comes to the book you are given, because not everyone has the same interests. For example; last summer we received\n \n The Secret Life of Bees and I absolutely loved it, but some other students in my class found it to be derivative and boring. Thats where our individuality comes in. We all differ in our interests and it's hard to find something that everyone has in common.\n \n I find myself enjoying projects more than normal school work because of the control I have over them. If you take away that aspect, there is really no point of doing the project instead of a regular worksheet. Recently we have been given lots of projects in English class that made up for the repeated summer work. We were lucky enough for the new projects to have been mostly student-based and student-taught. The most recent project was a student-teacher assignment. We received a topic and had to come up with a lesson plan to teach the rest of our class. I had to teach about active and passive voice. I taught a short lesson on what it was, and then I gave out a timed worksheet. The first person who finished and got them all correct received a prize. We also got to grade the class on how well they did, like a teacher would. The assignment wasn't necessarilyÂ about how well you did teaching, but it was about how well the class took in the information you taught. That project was really enjoyable. It was really creative and way more interesting than if we were given a specific sheet to follow like we would usually get.\n \n In conclusion, Students would be way more receptive to a student-designed project than a teacher-designed project. They would get the opportunity to express themselves and show what they are really capable of. Everyone is creative and they should get the chance to showcase that to themselves, their teachers, and their classmates. Hopefully in the future, we will get more of a chance to express ourselves through our work and get opportunities to be creative.Â",

    Essay: "In all reality I feel that if a school system wants a childs brain to blossom with ideas and learn how to be creative then the teachers should let the students design their own project for example; when I was younger I had to do a project for school and I did not like the reading project that was assigned it didnt let my creativity flow and I couldnt get into the book. Kids like to explore and find new things to do. Let a kid be a kid dont assign them something they would not find fun over the summer.\n \n I would like to begin with, when i was young and iÂ had to do a reading assignment over summer i didnt do it because it wasnt what i craved and wanted to do,i wanted to be a explorer and find new things and played in the mud. I went around and tried to find things that interested me and I started to collect bugs and tried to find out what they was and when i went back to school i told my teacher that i collected bugs and found out the names of them and iÂ proceed to ask her if i could write a essay since i did not do the reading project and she let me do the essay about bugs. so my creativity was able to flow out and i found out something that i enjoyed doing that i did not know liked doing.\n \n In addition to, children like to find stuff to do and not realize it could be bad and not understand the out comeÂ so let a kid be a kid and be creative so they can explore their minds and find something they enjoy doing and summer is about having fun and hanging out with your friends and family. I think kids do not do the assignments that are assigned to them because they do not find it interesting, a kid need to find something interesting in order to want to do it. If they can not design their projects for summer then they should not have to do them, i feel that when a child has the opportunity to do something that they find creative then they will end up doing it.\n \n To end with, summer is all about taking a break from school and being free teachers should not assign projects to students they should not feel like they are forced to do something when they can let their mind explore and learn new thing on their own. If a teacher just gives out a project and is like here do this over summer then the student might not find it interesting and not do it. If students are able to design their own projects and be them self then their minds can bloom into some beautiful and amazing they will find out a new part of them self that they never knew they had.\n \n In conclusion, a student should be able to design their own project so they can discover more about them self that they never knew existed. When It comes to teachers giving out summer projects i can see why some students may not complete it because they could find it boring or they just arent interested in doing it, thats why i think summer projects should be student designed and they should be forced to do a project that they dont find interesting. So if school assign summer projects let the students design the project and see what type of response you get back. Remember summer isnt about doing work its about being able to have fun with family and friends.Â",

    Essay: "Although summer is considered as a break from school, it is a rather perfect opportunity for students to continue working on assignments in orderÂ to keep the ideas they learned over the course of the year fresh in their minds before they head back. To do this, many schools are adopting mandatory summer projects for students to complete before their next school year will begin. These projects will stimulate critical thinking and sharpen the skills that students have learned in their previous year. Although many parents think that teachers know the capabilities of their student, which is why they should be the ones to design it, it should be student designed because students are more likely to understand their peers' schedule and difficulties in the content; by making them student designed, these projects will successfully, and efficiently, accomplish their purpose.\n \n Even though many teachers claim that they are very close with their students, in truth, they do not know much about what their students do. During the summer, aside from going on family vacations and other recreational activities, many students have responsibilities like volunteer work, internships, jobs, taking care of siblings, and etc. that take up a lot of time out of their day. Teachers do not know a student's life outside of academics and will therefore not consider these aspects of their life. As a result, teachers will most likely design a project that could be very time consuming and strenuous for students. However, if the project is student-designed, it would be designed knowing that students have other responsibilities outside of of academics. With the schedule of a student in mind, the project will be designed in a way that will be evenly spread out content wise, with enough time to complete each assignment.\n \n Although teachers argue that they have taught for many years and they know the weak pointsÂ students have for certain topics, they are all basing it off of statistics. Just because students on average found a certain topic difficult does not mean that all will; and some will find a different one difficult. By gathering a group students, the students will be able to pin point which topics are easy and which will require more explaining.Â Additionally even if teachers were able to successfully identify which topics are troublesome for students, they will not be able to solve the issue present in the most simplest way. Recently the demand for tutors is growing and the reason is that is many of these tutors are young. They have only recently finished their studies. But most importantly, their age gap between their tutees, the students that tutors help,Â isÂ a measly couple of years, compared to the decades of years between students and teachers. Because of this minuscule age gap, these tutors understand a student's difficulties better. They have gone through the problems that their tuteeÂ is going through very recently. As result of this, unlike teachers who will provide a lengthy explanation that was told to them by their professors many years prior, tutors will explain how to solve these problems moreÂ efficientlyÂ and accurately. Similarly, that is why students, knowing where their peers' difficulties lay, will be able to able to create assignments that are specifically targeted towards students and their success in the content.\n \n With these summer projects, students will successfully master their acquired skills from the previous year and get a head startÂ in their studies for their year to come. Due to this, students will face a smooth transition from their prior grade to their next. Additionally, by making these projects student designed, the projects will not interfere in their day to day activities during the summer and will provide assignments that will efficiently target students' weak areas and strengthen them. Both of these goals will be met by including enough time each assignment and including easy to follow videos, created by students, explaining difficult topics.Â  Â Â Â",

    Essay: "Have you ever had to do a project during the summer break? In some schools, they may require that you do a few projects in order to maintain what you have learned, usually being designed by the teachers, which may not work with most students. Instead, the students should design the projects as they know more what works for them educationally and they know how to adjust the project to their schedule.\n \n Oftentimes, not all students learn content in the same ways; some students may be visual learners whereas others are more lecture based learners. This also extends to projects, where certain student excel better at certain categories, such as a music student being more effective at making music for a video project. Oftentimes in projects when a student can't effectively do a project, they get a lower grade, which lowers their average Grade Point Average alongside other things simply because they do not work well with the specific subject of the project. Because of this fact, students should design their projects as they know how they work as well as how the learn. Not only does a student designed project allow for the student to be more effective at completing it, it gives the students a greater interest in the topic, allowing both increased creative drive as well as increased motivation to complete the project.\n \n When it comes to projects and deadlines, schools oftentimes roll out standards and assessments that don't take into account how the individual student would be able to effectively abide my them. In many cases there are students who are unable to complete assignments and attend events because of complications in their life that they can't control, such as, but not limited to: Needing to work to support their family, needing to care for a family member, having to travel to another country or place because of their family, and many more. In cases such as that, the projects and assignments set by the school, which are often based on the assumption that students do not possess any tasks beyond school, are simply hard if not impossible to complete for those students. If the students would be able to make their projects, then they can design them to fit alongside their life, making it so that they are more capable of accomplishing them. Alongside making it better for the students, it could help increase the high school graduation rate as many students drop out of high school because they are unable to complete their education.\n \n In discussions of this topic, some may say that the students don't know what they need to do for the projects so they can't make them. This argument, however, is invalid for quite a few reasons. Firstly, the students know what the course that they took in the passing school year contained. As they know what the year contained, they can make their projects cover those topics. Secondly, the students don't need to design the project solely by themselves. The teachers of the respective course could be of assistance by providing a checklist of sorts to assist the students in making the project. Thirdly, the teachers who design projects often make them in a sweeping manner, which as been explained earlier doesn't work with all students.\n \n In conclusion, summer projects that schools require should be made by students for a couple of reasons. These include the fact that students can adjust the project to fit their learning alongside that they can adjust it to better align with their life. For those reasons, schools should allow students to make their own summer projects.",

    Essay: "During the school year students dream about the summer ,but neglect the summer project that is assigned. For many years, teachers have assigned a summer project for students to do. Most students completely forget about the project. They don't have motivation to start or finish the project because it's not in their interest. Some believe that summer projects should be teacher-designed. Although some may disagree, summer projects should be student-designed.\n \n A reason why projects should be student oriented is that students become more expressive in their summer project. Students become more creative when projects feel less like a chore. I could program a game or website over the summer to show my creativity. As wellÂ this allows the student to think outside of the box. Another reason is students will be more diverse in their project. No one will have the same project. This allows the teacher to go in depthÂ with grading to give a more accurate grade. Many peers can learn something new from each others project rather than all learning the same thing. I would make a project to why the military is very beneficial. However, one student might think civilian life is better. We could discuss to each other our views. Furthermore, students will have more motive to complete their project. I always put aside the summer school project. It's never fun to do work that doesn't interest you. This allows for the percentage of students completing their project to rise.\n \n Student designed projects allows students to find new interests. Doing a project on something you learned already makes it feel repetitive. I personally wasn't all about NJROTC until I started to come to practice more ,and this opened a new array of options for me after high school. This allows the students to be more geared to learn new things such as: building a computer, time management during the school year, and budgeting. Additionally, another reason why projects should be student oriented is cheating will decrease among projects. If the teacher assigns the same projects people can easily cheat off each other. During the summer, I have been asked multiple times from friends if they could copy off my project. If I were to do my own project they couldn't copy off of me. Students can learn more information from doing the project themselves. This also shows the skill level of students. Finally, students have more freedom to do their project. This allows them to express their ideas. I love to have freedom it allows me to have a sense of free will. This allows most to make the project to feel a lotÂ less like a project ,and more of a fun activity to do.\n \n Although some may disagree, summer projects should be student-designed. The reason I believe this is expressing yourself, diversity, more motive to complete the project, finding new interests, cheating will decrease, and more freedom. Although, some believe that summer projects should be teacher-designed. Ultimately, students should have the right to choose what they want to do in their project since it's their project.",

    Essay: "When the school year is completed and time for summer vacation, students tend to forget material worth of nine months in a break. Many classes, such as AP or honors require upcoming students to complete summer assignments in two months. When there are no assignments to complete, many individuals take the time to hang out with friends or spend most of the time on technology. With the continuous use of games and social media on a daily basis, school habits such as grammar is modified in a student. Teachers try to prevent the overuse in technology to assure that children are obtaining the correct information on what is being learned. The assignments that teachers provide in the summer is beneficial, because it allows students to continue to learn core subjects which keeps the brain active. Teacher-designed projects allow students to become familiar with the curriculum, focuses on quality, and an understanding of the new group of students in the subject.\n \n Teachers provide summer assignments to introduce what the curriculum focuses on to students. Some teachers acknowledge what needs to be taught in the next school year, so many provide assignments that relate to what will be covered during the school year. Multiple classes, such as, AP Lang and Composition summer project focused on rhetorical literary devices which is learned throughout the school year when writing a rhetorical analysis. Comparing to if the project was student-designed, it would be challenging to understand what needs to be learned if there are no guidelines to follow. Student would have to assume what would be part of the curriculum and not comprehending the correct materials of what should be learned. If the project is designed by the teacher, it allows students to indicate what information may be taught in the upcoming school year.\n \n Character plays an important role to first impressions on the first day of school. When teachers assign projects over the summer, it allows students to approach the assignment as best see fit. Some students may go above and beyond while others may do the opposite. By looking at how students completed the summer project, it allows teachers to comprehend what type of person one may be such specific word choice. The project could be viewed at how artistic and creative it was, or it could be presented on how the student's word choice and the way it was formatted. Some teachers provide projects to get an understanding of the new group of students that will be attending the class. A teacher may provide a guideline to assist with the project, however, if the project was student-designed, some students may not do the assignment which could lead to a bad first impression.\n \n Typically, what is essential to projects and assignments is the amount of quality and effort that is put in. When teachers assign a project, usually, students add effort and quality into what is being presented. If there is a rubric to follow, then the quality of the project should be well-represented towards the student. However, if there was no rubric to follow, then the quality of \"excellent\" could potentially be different in the teachers perspective. When there is a guideline, such as a rubric, it advocates students on how the teacher best sees' the highest grading point to the lowest.\n \n For example, students that add effort to the summer project, will lead to the quality of the product in a presentable way. If the summer assignment was student-designed, then many might not provide the quality and effort which results in a bad representation. The more effort put in, the better the quality the summer assignment will be.\n \n Many schools provide students to complete summer assignments and projects to be aware that individuals are still learning during the break. Teachers try to make sure that children are gaining knowledge by making activities for the brain to still be active. Teachers that assign projects over the summer is beneficial because it allows students to still be in the habit of learning school skills such as grammar. Proctor-designed projects allow students to become familiar with the curriculum, focuses on quality, and an understanding of the new group of individuals in the subject. As a result, summer assignments should be teacher designed.Â",

    Essay: "Summer is the longest break students get. Every kid loves the hot summers and playing outside. The only downside to summer is the fact that most kids forget a lot of what they learned throughout the school year. Majority of kids are more focused on having a fun summer than they are on retaining their knowledge, which is why summer projects were created. Although, some students take no breaks from their education, teachers should be the ones designing the students' summer projects so those children can continue learning during break.\n \n A protruding factor that supports the position that teachers should plan the summer projects for students is that the teachers are the masters of what they are teaching. Teachers go to school to study and learn about the subject they are teaching so they know more about it than the students do. For example, a teacher goes to school for four years to study physics and teaching. Then, they go on to teach that subject to students. Since they have a degree in those areas of studies that proves their credibility to them knowing what they are doing. While some students may be well educated on a subject, a teacher has a degree, which shows they hold superior knowledge and really know how to get a student to learn a subject the right way. Therefore, teacher's should design student summer projects.\n \n Another prime point to key in on is the fact that teachers are more experienced than the students by a large margin. Most teacher's have been educators for years, and even if they have not, they have been in the field for years. Becoming a teacher is something that takes time. What has to be kept in mind is that they once were students too, so they know what is best to do or give to help their students continue learning. My aunt, for example, studied mathematics for four years in college and is now a math teacher at a high schoolÂ nearby. She knows what is best to do for her students to learn because she once had to learn it all too. Although students have experience in the learning field, teachers are more experienced and know what is the best way to design a project for students to continue learning even through breaks.\n \n One under mindedÂ factor that should be considered when determining whether teachers should design the summer project is the level of maturity teachers hold compared to students. Teachers are much older than their students, as a result, they are more experienced in the world, which makes them more mature. For example, if I were given the opportunity to make my own summer project, I would make it as short and easy as possible. This shows my immaturity as a kid because i want to spend as little time learning in the summer as possible and use the rest of that time to have fun. My math teacher on the other hand, realizes that summer is long and if the students do not do any math over the summer, then they will forget a lot. To prevent that, she gives out lengthy math packets so her students can continue learning. This shows her maturity in her realization of how important it is for a student to continue learning even through breaks. While some students may be mature, teachers are more mature than the majority of their students. Thus, teachers should be given the responsibility of designing summer projects.\n \n Even though some students are serious learners day in and day out, teachers should be the ones planning out the summer projects for students. Children are focused more on having fun than they are on furthering their education during any break. Summer is no exception, for some it is a resting time, but for most it is an opportunity to slack off on their education. Teachers know how to keep the kids learning, nevertheless, the teachers should do the teaching and the students should do the learning.Â",

    Essay: "The last thing a student wants to hear is that they have a project over their summer break. Why not make it fun for them? The school year is when students are taught a certain curriculum and then at the end of the year given a final exam or project. Summer break is a chance to break away from that structure which is why school projects that are over the summer should be designed by the students. These projects should be student-designed because the students can chose something they are interested that relates to school and it builds independent skills.\n \n It could be a student or a CEO. When people are interested in something, they make it a priority. It is why student-designed projects are the best option. An example would be school clubs such as DECA and FCCLA. These are national student organizations that are simply supervised by school officials but headed by the students. These clubs do operate year round which is what makes it great for summer projects. These clubs prepare students for post secondary life and provide educational and real world skills in a variety of subjects students could be interested in. Students also must utilize skills from school such as presenting, writing, and research in any given area. Having student-designed projects within their interests will help their future and make learning more enjoyable.\n \n To enter the workforce or college, a student needs to be a well rounded individual to succeed. Student- designed projects will be a foundation for those independent skills they will need. DECA and FCCLA will provide several of those skills such as leadership, teamwork, people skills, critical thinking, managing a business, and more. These organizations are also competitive with certain subject areas which also encourages skills like studying, or hands on skills such as demonstrating or teaching. In the TV show Degrassi, a group of high school juniors come together to do a project over break for their school. This project had consisted of research on the history of their community and how to make it better. To do this project, they needed to gather information, use teamwork, utilize critical thinking skills, and present in front of the school board. In a similar manner to the organizations already mentioned, they also gained valuable skills of leadership, managing, and teaching. While it was directly related to their school, unlike FCCLA and DECA. They also shared the skills of motivation and organization with FCCLA and DECA but they took a different approach.\n \n There are many ways to have a productive, educational, and fun summer project for schools everywhere. It all starts with students designing their projects to build independent skills and choosing to work on something that is interesting to them. While teacher designed projects will help them with their current school and build skills for the academic side of their future which is important, they are more for the immediate. Students now are the future, therefore these reasons listed are why they must be designed by the students. Giving students a path to becoming better and more successful citizens. Â Â Â Â Â Â",

    Essay: "Most students dislike summer assignments, could that change if they desgined the assignment themselves? Summer assignments can be a chore that students are unhappily forced to complete. I believe that if students could design their own summer projects they would be more willing to complete it because it promotes creativity, gives them control over how they do their project, and gives it an overall feeling that its not just another boring assignment.\n \n Others could say that without direction students wouldn't know what to do. However; without that direction students can have full creativity over what they do. From multiple tests i've seen, when a student is allowed to work how they want their creativity and willingness to work increases tenfold. Given the opportunity to be creative on their own, students can and will be more productive and willing to complete an assignment.\n \n No one likes to be told what to do, this is all the same for students. If students are given control over how they work on projects and assignments they are much more productive. The freedom a student can feel when given control over a project will only encourage them to continue learning throughout the summer.\n \n School can be a boring and repetitive place for students, multiple assignments all feeling the same can wear them down. When summer rolls around its a breathe of relief, until they realize there is still more learning to do. If students designed their own project however, that could all change and very well could be excited to actually continue learning throughout the summer.\n \n In conclusion, students dislike assignments, especially during the summer. But if a student was allowed to design and create it themselves it would not only promote creativity, give them control over the project allowing them to not feel chained to the rules, and give them the mindset that they are not just completing another assignment.

    Essay: "During school, students are constantly testing their knowledge by learning new things, but throughout summer break when school is not in session, students often forget what they were taught during the school year. Most projects assigned to students are teacher-designed, even though a student-designed project would be more beneficial towards their education.\n \n Although a teacher-designed summer project serves as a guideline for topics the student should focus on, student-designed summer projects are more efficient because they teach students to be more creative, help the students decide a method that could help them remember what they learned during the school year, and allows the student to work at their own pace without stress.\n \n When learning something new, creativity plays a significant part in success. Students who apply their creativity to a project are more likely to enjoy and learn from their assignment rather than those who choose not to. For example, if a student was given a writing assignment and allowed to write whatever they desire, the student's interest would spark and their creativity would show. Another example is if students worked on project in groups; The group members would be allowed to combine their creativity to create a successful piece.\n \n Decision-making is a key component to life, therefore students should be allowed to make their own decisions when it comes to creating a project. For example, if a student was asked to do a book report by their English teacher, the student should be allowed to decide how they would like to present. This method helps the student learn because they are incorporating their own methods and decisions. By doing this, the student is incorporating their learning capabilities into a work of their own, thus allowing them to successfully learn the topic.\n \n Learning at another's pace rather than oneself is an inefficient way to learn new information. Therefore, a teacher incorporating their way of working into a project is unacceptable for a student's learning process. For example, a student who is given homework should be able to complete it without a deadline because the student would be working at their own pace and learn from what they are practicing rather than stressing about the deadline. Also, when stress is involved in learning, students are less likely to complete their assigments because they will have anxiety attempting to start.\n \n In conclusion, student-designed summer projects are more efficient beacuse they teach students to be more creative, help the students decide a method that could help them remember what they learned during the school year, and allow the student to work at their own pace to prevent stress. Teachers should allow students to design their own projects because it motivates them to learn how they want to learn. If teacher-designed projects continue to be incorporated, students will be less likely to complete their projects while learning new topics.Â",

Summer projects should be teacher-designed because students will procrastinate when choosing the project, students will make the project too easy, and teachers are more experienced than students.\n \n School can be very stressful for a student, but that might not always fall on the teacher. Students tend to make things harder for themselves by waiting at the last minute to complete assignments, especially when they are given more freedom on the project. Summer is the best time of the year for a student and they do not want to spend that time thinking of what topic or project they should choose. Students will procrastinate and wait to the very last minute to come up and complete their assignment. If a teacher picked the assignment, they can give students the tools and structure they need to make an A+ worthy project.\n \n Right after the final bell to signal the start of summer, a student earns a sense of freedom and accomplishment. Summer is the time where students want to sit back, relax, and soak it all in. That's why if the summer project was designed by a student, the project would be way too easy. In the summer, all students want is the time to be young. To go out with friends and enjoy a warm summer night. But having a summer project to come up with gets in the way of that time. Students would want to get back to that time as soon as possible. Therefore, the students would make a project so easy that it would in no way benefit them. Students will find a way to make the easiest, and least time consuming activity for a project. Teachers, however can design a project with the right difficulty to help a student move forward with their learning, while also insuring the best summer vacation possible for the students.\n \n During the 182 day school year teachers have a lot of projects and assignments to come up with. That's why when designing a summer project, teachers are the perfect people for the job. Students aren't as experienced as teachers when it comes to coming up with a project. Teachers make many projects over the course of the school year and they most likely have gotten the formula down by the time summer comes to a start. Teachers know how to structure and execute a project to help students learn to their fullest potential.\n \n In conclusion summer projects should be designed by teachers because teachers have a better ability to structure a project, students will tend to procrastinate when given freedom on a project, and students will limit themselves by making the project way too easy. At the end of the day, summer projects are made to help students maintain their ability to learn over the summer and I believe that teachers are the people best suited to help students grow during their summer vacation.",

Teacher's have been proven to more knowledgeable then their younger counterparts. Teachers are just overall more knowledgeable about how to teach their students.\n \n In order for teachers to better prepare their students for their class; a summer project is best left to the teachers to plan out. The reason being that teachers should have a pretty good idea of they should be teaching for that year's education. Centering the project on what teachers will be teaching; would better help understand where their students stand on certain subjects of that class. Not to mention, teachers also have more experience in what students should be learning because at one point they were students themselves.\n \n Being a teacher most certainly means that teachers have gone through learning experiences that they thought had gone well, or maybe had thought classes could have been taught using better methods. Teachers can then apply what they have learned from previous learning experiences ,and either take or improve uponÂ them.\n \n Then, we have the most obvious reason why student shouldn't come up with their own summer projects. Student have time and again proven that they push off or be become lazy doing certain tasks. This may not be the case for all student, however it is the majority. Another reason why students may not be able or be good at planning projects, is because they may be simply to busy doing other activities.

    Essay: "Have you ever imagined allowing students design their own summer projects? Would allowing them be beneficial to their learning? Many strongly believe that if students were to design their own assignments it would give them more motivation, but if anything it is not educationally helping them. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because students would not actually do their assignments, the teachers know exactly what they want their students to learn during the summer, and it's an efficient way for teachers to prepare their students for the upcoming school year.\n \n Many students always have a way of getting their teachers to allow them come up with class assignments but that is not always the best thing to do. If it is up to them to create what they need for the summer, they will not be productive. They can create something that they think is so much fun compared to the things their teacher gives them, but it could be something completely different to the subject their work should be about. All teachers know what every single one of theirÂ students need to improve on; they create assignments based on certain subjects an individual or the whole class needs help on, so that it does not become a huge issue when entering the following school year. I mean don't get me wrong, teachers understand that the work they hand out to their students can't always be boring and when it is time to create the students assignments they should include some interesting activities for them to accomplish. Perhaps allowing them to create summer work is in some ways practically, but it is a distraction in the sense of it could take them all summer to settle down on a project they want and if that was the case then they would have wasted their whole summer of learning in just thinking about a project they want rather than simply just getting their work from their teachers. Certain people do have their own opinions, but what we always need to do is put our students education first.\n \n This should be viewed as a great opportunity teachers have for preparing their students for the upcoming school year. A strong number of people whether it's parents, teachers from different schools, or just friends don't believe that giving their kids summer work does prepare them for the next school year. In my past summers I remember that there wasn't a time where i did not have some sort of assignments to work on and I remember I always understood the first few subjects we were learned and that was because all the assignments I worked on actually helped me when school started. Many of my friends always tell me how one simple assignment did so much for them. I would always be lost and understand the new material from the very beginning. One simple project, work book, or even a packet of a certain subject can take a student so far, allowing students to feel more at ease and also allowing them to get amazing grades from the first few weeks of school. More so, it is a beneficial way to have more students succeed when testing time roles around at the end of the year. There has been a great amount of students who do strongly agree with summer projects being teacher-designed simply because they realize how remarkable the finishing results are.\n \n When thinking of a subject like this a number of questions run through my head like, \" Would the students or I truly create something so efficient to our learning just by instructionsÂ given to us from our teachers that try to explain what we need? \". Going back to the issue on students completely misinterpreting their expectations; not all kids can come up with an assignment that covers the details they need to work on. From personal experiences there has been multiple times where my teacher allowed us to make our own projects that should cover all our subject units, but I completely failed because i would think I was doing it all correct and when it came to the due date and test time I would fail. This is just an inefficient way, especially if you want your students to actually do great in your class. I mean it also makes it so much harder for the students to recover and catch up or having to bring up their grades. In the end it's all about assuring your students will be outstanding throughout the whole school year in everything they do.\n \n Student-designed summer projects might have a nice sound to it, but a students future should be in consideration. All these summer assignments should be teacher-designed simply because students will not complete their tasks, all teachers know the work their students need to improve on, and it's an efficient way for teachers to prepare their students for the following school year, so that it does not hit them all at once. Students could go through a great amount of stress if it were up to them and that could all end in a horrendous way, which is why it is not a great idea to allow them to create their summer work.Â Â",

    Essay: "When most people think of summer they think of things like the beach,sun, travel and relaxation. Many students do not think about learning during their summer break, nor do they want to. However most schools require their students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning over break. These summer projects should be student-designed because fellow students will be able to understand their peers struggles and interests, connect with a project that is designed for them, and learn more from topics and examples that interest them.\n \n Fellow students have a much better understanding and knowledge to what students are interested in, as well as things they may struggle with. Their peers would be able to design a project that they know their friends will enjoy. A student-designed project will help prevent a student from not being able to complete the assignment. For example if a teacher where to assign an online web quest but didntÂ know that some students did not have access to the internet, a fellow peer would see that issue in their school and know to create a project to be submitted by paper. it is also well known that if something does not interest a student they probably would not want to complete it. A project created by a peer would help grab their attention, make connections, and get them excited to complete it.\n \n Being able to connect with an assignment is very important for a students drive and interest in a project. If a student can connect to their assignment they will be more excited to complete it. A fellow student will be able to better connect a project to the current trends and interests. This will boost a students confidence and not make them dread doing work over the summer. A summer assignment should not feel like work; if a student connects to it and enjoys the topic then it will feel less like extra work that they have to do over their summer vacations'. When a student connects to a topic this will make them eager to learn more about the project.\n \n When a topic interests some one they are more likely to want to learn more about it. If a student was to design a project that interests their peers it will help them learn more and get more take away from an assignment, which is the whole point of an summer project. Parents and teachers want their students to continue to learn over the summer, so when a student has an assignment that they actually want to do they are more likely to benefit and learn from it even with out noticing that they are learning.\n \n Students obviously dont want to have to do work over the summer. So summer assignments need to be fun hands on and include topics that students enjoy and connect to. This will helpÂ students be engaged and continue their education while school in not in session; which is exactly what parents and teachers want! Students will benefit greatly from a student-designed project because their peers are able to understand what they enjoy, connect with their topics, and learn more from a project that interests them.

    Essay: "The Summer Project\n \n Summer projects are often popular to help assure that students are still learning throughout their break. What many people can not agree on is whether they should be student or teacher designed. Either way it is still providing knowledge to be gained during this time period, but by students designing them a better outcome should be seen overall.\n \n As seen so many times before, kids do not want to do school work in the summer; which is why they are typically so excited for break. Allowing them to create their own project leaves room for creativity and imagination. Creativity is put into place because they can take whatever they want , with some guidelines from the teacher of course, and turn it into something nobody has ever seen before. The internet is so handy and has the answers to almost everything now, children can just look up ways to do the project if teachers design it. Therefore, they are not really learning anything, just changing some things around enough in another's work, so that it is not plagiarism.\n \n Summer plans could get in the way as well. Some kids go away all summer or are working, as well as playing sports. With this being their time to relax they are not going to want to do a project that they did not come up with or might not be interested in. If they do create it, they can make it about their summer or something to do within their summer plans. That way, it is not such an inconvenience. With the project being more wrapped into their summer it could also make it easier for them, provide better grades, as well as the understanding of a subject.\n \n Teachers have specific curriculum that they have to teach every year. Depending on how their schedules are laid out. Such as, class all year around or just one semester of that specific class, can provide a crunch time. More often then not, the class does not finish up all the curriculum. If the teacher provides a project over the summer to ensure that the students learn what they need to before school starts, there is less crunch time and stress off both the teacher and students shoulders. By designing the project they can ensure that the children gain the knowledge that they need and are prepared to jump ahead on the first day back to school. A set topic and guidelines can allow for easier and quicker grading for the teacher. Just because a project is done the correct way, does not always mean that whoever completed it truly understands and can grasp that topic. Cheating is often done in times like this because nobody wants to do a boring teacher designed project during summer break.\n \n For better understanding, grades, more effort, and happier students, summer project should not only be student-designed but come with certain guidelines from the teacher. By creating their own work, it allows for the students to get interested and learn about the topic well. Although, it will not always be easy for them, it can provide better outcomes in the end. Their knowledge is what we should be concerned about, what promotes that more and that is what has to be thought about when arguing this topic.Â",

    Essay: "The bane of many students existence are summer projects. Many students dread having to complete yet more schoolwork during the time in which they are supposed to be taking a break from school. Though we may not enjoy summer assignments, it can not be denied that they do help students retain information over the summer. Some people feel that these summer assignment should be guided by the students, while others feel the teacher should design the project. In my opinion, summer projects should be teacher designed because the teacher can ensure that students are learning what they think is important,Â it outlines what students need to do so that they do not have to stress about making their own project, and students can assist each other due to the projects being uniform.\n \n If the teacher designs the project, they can ensure that what the students are learning over the summer is going to benefit them when summer break ends. If students are allowed to make their own projects, the risk of them researching something unimportant or irrelevant is not unlikely. When a teacher designs the project, they can make sure that everything students are learning over the summer is important and relevant to their class. When I was in elementary school, we were assigned summer reading. This summer assignment was intended to help us improve at reading and to last most of the summer. No book list was given so we were free to choose any book we pleased. As a result, many kids chose to read short, easy books in order to complete the project as quick, and with as little effort, as possible. This puts them at a disadvantage as they did not get the same reading and word practice that other kids got. Teachers should design summer projects in order to make sure students learn what is necessary for the class.\n \n If students are given a summer assignment by theirÂ teacher, they are more likely to complete it over the summer, rather than last minute. As a student, knowing exactly what I have to do for the assignment makes it easier for me to complete them over time. This is because I know exactly what I need to do to finish the project, thus I can plan as to when I will complete each part of the project. To have the student design the project would add an extra layer of stress over coming up with and completing a project. This leads to them putting it off until they run out of time and have to rush their project to turn it in. When they wait until the last minute, they are likely to retain less information than if they did the project throughout the summer. During the transition from eighth to ninth grade, I was assigned a summer reading of a Greek mythology book. Along with the book, I was given a reading guide to fill out and turn in when school started. Having the reading guide allowed me to split up the reading and complete it over time. I could complete a page of the reading guide and then take a break, then pick it up another day and complete another page. Overall, teacher designed summer projects encourage students to complete their assignment over the summer through providing a structure that students can follow.\n \n Teacher created summer assignments promote collaboration as they are identical across students, allowing students to discuss with and help each other. This collaboration allows them to have better projects and learn more about the topic they are required to research. Students can share what they know in order to learn from each other. Some students are better at certain topics than others, if they can combine their knowledge with that of others they will improve their understanding of the topics. With no teacher to ask over the summer, their peers are the only one they have access to. Students can get help from their classmates and both improve their assignment, and their relationship. Being able to ask for help is greatly beneficial to students as ,otherwise, they would just leave it be and never be able to correct it. Going back to my Greek mythology summer reading, every student had to read the same book that I was. I was able to ask my classmates what they thought about certain parts of the book that I did not understand. This collaboration allowed me to better understand the book and succeed in that unit when I returned to school. Creating uniform summer projects promotes help and collaboration between students.\n \n In conclusion, summer assignments should be teacher created so that teachers can make sure students learn what is necessary, students actually do the assignment over the summer, and to allow students to work together on the assignment. I believe that it would not only benefits students, but also the teacher. The point of summer assignments is to help students retain or learn information. The teacher knows best what students need to learn over the summer to be successful when school begins. Teacher created summer assignments provide many benefits over student designed summer assignments and is the best way for students to learn over the summer",

They feel that students will follow the same path. I believe that it should be student-designed because the projects will be created differently, there may be different information in each project and students will prove their capacity to do their own project.\n \n The projects will be created differently. Students have different ideas on how to do a project. There is variety of ideas on how to do a project. Students can choose any way on how to do it, depending on what the project is about. Some students are more creative than other students. They may have different types of creativity. By doing this project students will show if they are still learning.

    Essay: "Summertime is by far the most favored season among students. Students of all ages get to relax and not have to worry about what time the bus comes or what day their six-page lab report is due. Three months of no worries is something that anyone could dream for, and students are fortunate to get it every year. Some could even argue that summer is too short, considering that we only get three months of break compared to the nine months we are in school. Nevertheless, summer is a gift for all the hard work students put in all year. As great as summer may appear to be, there is sometimes a downside that is tied to school: summer projects and assignments. Usually, the words \"summer\" and \"assignment\" are not supposed to go in the same sentence; but in some instances, schools give assignments to students over the summer so they are not unprepared for the arrival of the next school year. These assignments are meant to be helpful rather than work to keep you busy. Most students think these assignments are not right to give, and prefer to design the projects themselves if they must have them. For many obvious reasons, students should not design their own summer projects, for it is the teachers that truly know what will better them as students.\n \n Although student-designed summer projects may seem like an advantage to the student, it is very much the opposite. If a student designs something for themselves to be able to learn, they would not know what their supposed to do. With no real knowledge of the curriculum, how would a student be more well suited to create an assignment for themselves? Students need the teachers to set things up for them because they are the professionals that get paid to make these projects. The teacher will always know what is best for the student whether the student chooses to accept that or not. Summer projects are not always the most fun to do, but teachers construct them in order to benefit the student. Similar to the saying \"mother knows best,\" teachers know what is best for the student. Summer assignments should result in gratefulness toward teachers rather than resentment; because it is those same teachers who give the assignments that care the most about the student's future and wants them to be challenged. The bigger picture of these assignments should be thought about rather than seeing them as absolute burdens. Just trust and believe in the process.\n \n Next, if a student makes his/her own assignment, they would not push the limits of their own ability. In reality, if something could come easy rather than difficult for someone, the odds of taking the difficult path are slim to none. For example, a student is given the opportunity to write an essay on any topic they choose to. That may seem like an advantage to the student, but in reality is a disadvantage. The student will choose a subject that is very familiar to them because it is the safest to dive into. Doing what is easy defeats the whole purpose of what is supposed to strengthen a student. Teachers giving assignments is a more sensible concept because they know what will benefit the student. The whole purpose of assignments and projects being assigned rather than student-designed is to break students out of their comfort zone. Testing their abilities and seeing what they are capable of gives a better evaluation of the student. A student's willingness to work is crucial to their future as well as other aspects of life. Student-designed projects are not usually given because they do not display true capabilities. A task must be given to a student to determine their ability to go above and beyond.\n \n Lastly, teacher-designed summer assignments give the student a better understanding of what to expect for the upcoming school year. To illustrate, a new student could newly enroll in the school after moving from another state. The standards compared from their old school to the new school are likely to be different, leaving the student oblivious to what they will endure. The summer assignment is a preview for the year, showing what the student should expect to experience throughout the duration of the year. Summer projects also refresh students to how school goes so they are not going into the new year unprepared. Every student, for the most part, comes back to school rusty after summer break. Handwriting is crooked, having to adjust to the new schedule, even forgetting the log-inÂ and password to the computer. All of those things are expected because those things are taken out of the daily schedule that students endure. All of those things also make teacher-designed summer projects all the more effective as refreshment. Doing those projects get students back in the swing of things, as well as providing a head startÂ for the new year.\n \n To conclude, it is essential to students that their teachers design their summer projects. There are no real advantages to students designing their own summer assignments, whether students realize that or not. Teachers work everyday to better the education and future of their students; which means they know what is better for their students in the grand scheme of things. Although they may seem like a drag, summer assignments are meant to give a taste of what the new year will bring. A teacher would not give an assignment that provides no benefit to the student. Teachers are always a step ahead and know what is beneficial and not. Let them continue to do what they do best, which is help students go forward.Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

    Essay: "At many schools, summer projects are assigned to students. TheseÂ projects are usually either an essay or a research project. Currently, these projects are strictly designed by teachers without any say from the students. Should teachers be dictating what students must spend their days doing during both the school year and the summer months? Would it be more beneficial for students' education if they were able to design their own project? Summer projects should be designed by students because there is more room for creativity, it is more sustainable for students to accomplish, and students will be more driven to work on it.\n \n Summer projects should be designed by students because there is more room for creativity. Creativity is an important skill to have, so a student-designed project will definitely help students in that area to use after they graduate. Imagination and creativity is much more of a key factor in student-designed projects than ones designed by teachers. When each student is allowed to come up with their own idea, plan it out, and create the project with little to no restriction or guidelines, there is more room for each student to show their individuality and original ideas. Without teachers telling students precisely what they want to see when summer break is over, students can let their imaginations run wild and create something that they are proud of.\n \n Students should be the ones designing summer projects because they would be more sustainable for everyone. Many students in high schoolÂ have summer jobs in order to help support their families. A teacher might assign a project that is far to lengthy for some students to complete in addition to their daily eight-hour shifts and having to take care of their younger siblings. These students' grades would sink the second the new school year starts due to their inability to finish the time consuming summer project by the first day of school. If every student were able to design their own project, they would be able to create one that is more sustainable and able to fit into their busy schedule.\n \n Projects assigned over the summer should be designed by students because they will be more driven to work on it. Some might say that isn't the case, because students might not take the project as seriously as they would if it was designed by a teacher. On the other hand, if students were able to design their own projects, they would be able to choose a topic to research and write about that interests them. Therefore, they will be more inclined to complete it and will take the project even more seriously than they would if it was designed by a teacher. Student-designed projects would cause students to be driven by their interest in the topic they picked; instead of by the need to get it done before school starts. This would not only lead to more competed projects, but the projects would also have a lot more time and effort put into them.\n \n In conclusion, it would be more beneficial for students' education to design their own projects. This would lead to more room for creativity, being more sustainable for students to accomplish, and students are more driven to work on it. This matters because what students do and learn now will affect the rest of their life. Students being able to do their own project or research over the summer could lead to students improving their work ethic and even finding their true interests. Schools should start making the changes today to create a new and important future in summer projects.",

    Essay: "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during the break. There has been an recent argument stating if those projects should be designed by the students or teachers. Some state, projects should be teacher-designed because it will help students prepare for the upcoming school year, widen their knowledge of unknown subjects, and let's them apply critical thinking, but this is not true. Although some may disagree, I believe summer projects should be student-designed.\n \n There are a variety of reasons on why summer projects should be student-designed. One reason why they should be student-designed, is that the projects would be aimed toward their age. This is the case because, projects made by students would appeal more to the other students. It would also make the process of the project more fun because it is aimed towards the students' age. Another reason summer projects should be student-based, is that it would have more modern-based topics and issues. For example, the projects would have relevant issues of their society like, LGBT rights, school shootings, and police brutality. These projects would also have interesting topics students may enjoy. Those topics could be about: social media, celebrities, fashion, and sports. Student-based projects would also include diverse options. Student projects would let students have the option of doing group work. This would develop the students teamwork as wellÂ as their work ethic. Another option student-based projects would provide are projects related to students' hobbies and skills. Projects that require hands-on activities or art-like objectives, would strongly interest students into doing them.\n \n There are further reasons why summer projects should be student-based. Student-based projects would be easier to understand. Since the projects were made by students, the projects would help the students understand the information. Unlike a project made by teachers, student-based projects would help students learn at a way easier and faster level. When the projects are easier to understand, this would improve students' attention span. Another reason why summer projects should be student-based, is that students would obtain better grades. Students would improve at a subject at a far better level, because the projects would be topics that they enjoy. Since the project accommodates to them, the students would earn way better grades than something that doesn't interest them. When something interests a person, they tend to want to understand it at a far better level. The final reason, student-based projects are more beneficial, is that it would provide better learning. Students would be more invested in a student-based project, because it would be directed towards them. They would also be more involved, which would inevitably, make them learn better.\n \n I believe projects over the summer should be student-based. This is the case due to: it being aimed towards the students' age and it being more interesting. Those who disagree state: teacher-designed projects would help students get real practice, prepare the students, and help students widen their knowledge. I believe academic scores in school would be at an all time high due to students appliance to student-based projects than ever before.Â Â",

    Essay: "If the Summer is plagued with more work we should be the ones to design it, so we can still be an creative and a hardworking student, have a strong understanding of the subject and voice out pressing matters in the world.\n \n While us students want to be done with school and be free, it is scientifically proven that if you don't continue learning a subject you'll forget about the subject you're learning. To keep that retention, the students should create a project to keep you the students in check; It can vary from a research project to an presentation using key objectives in class to show how you used them in the real world. The position everyone should say is, yes to further have higher Graduation rates and Test scores, because if the students show compassion to their school work & their will to get things done, every one will succeed. When we work together, build each other up and help each other when needed the world becomes a whole lot brighter, nobody should have to be bogged down in a project that seems like it was made to have you suffer. This project should be fun and should make you want to complete it to show your classmates how well you did; It should also prove that you care for your work and backs it up .\n \n On the flip side teachers did go to college for, four plus years and have been in this profession for even longer, so that is a great factor onto why most summer projects are teacher designed and so pressing on certain subjects. It's not supposed to be hard, the teachers just want he best for you, and have to teach you the schematics for next year or for life. It's similar to parenting, sometimes you have to be harsh to get the point through and the point is to get that student to be well rounded before he/she leaves high school. All the Teachers want to see is the students being successful and confident in everything they do to better on their lives. In short they want us to succeed to better on our lives; which is selfless and much appreciated.\n \n Another way to choose a student project would be an voting system, a select few would pitch in ideas that are teacher approved, that way we are still learning the curriculum but in a different/ active way; After that the whole class votes, yes or no. If yes it goes on to other classrooms until the verdict is reached on if the project is fundamentally helpful and play a healthy part on work ethic. This project will help students with the strengths and weaknesses, they can either group up to get it done quickly or go solo a on their own pace. Instead of laying on the couch, eating, sleeping, overall being lazy they can make that brain work as if they were still in school, I'm talking about firing all 8 cylinders and constantly learn more on a rigorous daily basis\n \n However, teachers are no joke though as they work day and night to give us students the best education possible, it's stressful being a teacher and in our eyes a worthy sacrifice.\n \n Grading papers form 150 students and also having to stay on track and give out more papers is a hassle; thats why we have teacher aide's to help them get through the day which is selfless and deserves recognition. To every teacher, thank you for doing what you do if we did not have you we would not be here learning.\n \n To add on to the previous statements, we can be more inclusive and have a battle of the brains where all teachers do a project & students do a project, whoever wins by vote from the school staff will get a a reward of their teams choice; these are all just ways to do school work but with a spin of fun & healthy competition, because seriously work can be boring for teachers and students alike ways we can fix this on a daily basis are:\n \n Have an reward system regarding questions and candy.\n \n Play an Kahoot game on the subject to engage participation.\n \n Let students design homework or class plans.\n \n Let them grade papers and see the process and life of a teacher.\n \n Have students stand up and stretch.\n \n Ice breaker activities.\n \n Talk about foreign matters.\n \n These are just a few ways to stick out from the typical, book work and paper.\n \n Book work has dated back decades, Its time to modernize and find different ways to learn.\n \n While for decades teachers have been prescribing projects that are an inch thick in paper, we have been struggling, we need change now; Change is good and needed change is how we industrialized and now change will be how we do our tests, papers, essays & projects. We should be able to choose what subject a paper is on and how should it be done, because in all honesty we are the future so we need to work on certain matters, problems & accessions towards our future like emissions, pollution & much much more. Student designed projects will talk about these matters and open up the public eyes about how serious we, the youth of tomorrow are taking it as serious as Gun control, College Debt and other pressing matters. Allowing us students to work and talk about problems all around us would be a pleasure to spread awareness on these subjects.\n \n To wrap this all up, We the students of tomorrow would love to be able to control summer projects in terms of spreading awareness/ looking at hard topics the public usually avoids. To be inclusive and attention grabbing is the goal and we can push for regulations throughout the school system, a recent matter was opening high school later than usual and getting in the nitty-gritty with financial costs & Bus scheduling. We can and will build each other up on these group projects. In turn we are equipping the mind for the real world we can use steps the we gained form high schoolÂ and teamwork to get the job done, test scores & graduation rates would be higher due to us engaging in school year round. To close, we can't get anything done without Teamwork and student input, we need to let students have a say in their education to let them be the best the they can be in anything and everything they do.

Back in my home country I use to attend a school where I was assigned a project by my teacher to complete over the summer. That didn't go well for me because I already knew how to do everything she assigned me, which didn't increase my level of knowledge at all. It makes it very boring to work on something that someone else is assigning you and you dont get a chance to learn. Summer projects should be student-designed because it makes them more enjoyable for students to work on, gives them a reason to sit back and observe, and teaches them to follow responsibility.\n \n First off, projects should be designed by students because it makes them more enjoyable for students to work on. My friend use to go in a school where she had a chance to design her own project over the summer and she said that it was great working on it. In fact, she focused more on the topics she was weak in during the school year. Projects are very fun to work on when you know exactly how you're going to design it. I personally love working on stuff where I dont have anyone giving me directions. However, I'm pretty sure none of us like being given a specific topic to work on and just getting stuck with it.\n \n Secondly why projects should be student-designed is so the students have a reason to sit back and observe. Although, everyone is always busy partying around and having fun until they remember that they also have a task to complete. They will set time besides gamboling and sit down to think how they want to design their project. Students will learn to generate new ideas and have the power to think fast. Since teachers always design things for students to work on if, for example, homework, classwork, labs, and etc..why not give the student a project to design by themselves.\n \n Lastly, summer projects should be student-designed because it teaches the student to follow a responsibility. If project is designed by the teacher, students will know in the back of their head what they specifically need to work on and they won't find that extra time for critical thinking. Most of the students will keep delaying their project because they know their already provided with what they need to work on. This makes it important to give the students a chance to get something completed in their own time with their own thoughts and ideas.\n \n In conclusion, I'm pretty sure a lot of students enjoy working more on what they design than what the teacher assign them. It makes them feel like a grown up knowing that now they have the ability to design a project by themselves. They know to find time and have the responsibility to think on their project because it's going to be graded and turned in after the break ends. It would be really satisfying to see how different students create projects which they design by themselves without any help! Â Â Â Â",

    Essay: "Even during the summer, learning new material is important for students so that they can maintain their knowledge. Therefore, requiring students to complete summer projects is a great way to allow them to keep learning even outside of school. However, these projects would be best if they were teacher-designed, rather than if they were student designed. This is because teachers would be able to provide the projects with more reliable information and content than students who most likely would not be very experienced in the content. Also, students may not put much effort into their projects if they designed it, in order to make it less difficult for themselves, whereas teachers would make sure to design the projects in a way that would allow the students to put in the effort to learn the content. Lastly, teachers would be able to make the projects both educating and entertaining in order to fit the students' desires.\n \n Allowing teachers to design the summer projects for students would ensure that the students are provided with well-known and reliable content. For example, if the teacher were to design a math project with math problems or scenarios, it would most likely not have any mistakes and contain problems that the students would be able to solve. Whereas if the students were to design the projects that they didn't have much knowledge on, there would be a high chance that they may have made a mistake in the problems and as a result, affect their learning as well. Therefore, it would be less risky to allow these summer projects to be teacher-designed to make sure that the students are learning the right content that they need.\n \n Many students would argue that summer break should not include any schoolwork, therefore, assigning them to create a summer project would only influence them to create a project that is not educational,Â which would not benefit them in learning the content. For instance, if the student were completely against doing any schoolwork over their summer break but were still assigned with designing a science project, they would most likely design the project to be effortless, so that they could get it done as fast as they could, and not teach them any content. In order to ensure that the student does put in the effort to actually learn the information, it would be more beneficial to give them teacher-designed projects, which would provide them with the right level of effort that they would need to put into their work.\n \n In fact, a number of students do not even have much knowledge on how to create a well enough project that would best educate them. Therefore, teacher-designed projects would be able to suit the students' needs and provide them with information that would benefit them the most. In addition to this, teachers would be able to design the projects so that they could entertain the students as well as educate them. For example, the teacher could design a math game as a project, where the student could have fun playing the game as well as learn the math material. As a student just now learning the content, it would be best to have more experienced teachers create the projects in order to suit the students' level of knowledge on the specific content as well as their desire to be entertained.\n \n As a result, summer projects should most definitely be teacher-designed, as it would be more reliable, educating and entertaining. In the long run, the students would be more likely to learn the content without any mistakes and have fun learning it as well. Even if there are still many students who absolutely object the idea of teacher-designed projects, it would be best for them to keep in mind that these projects would do more to help than hurt them in their later years of school. In addition, these projects would give those students a head start in their learning and be more beneficial to help them maintain their knowledge for the rest of their school years.Â  Â Â Â",

    Essay: "Some schools require kids to do something school based over the summer, I don't agree with that at all. Kids use summer break as a vaction from all things school related. If they do make the kids do it then I think it should be student-designed. The reason being is, if you're going to take the students summer break then at least let them do what they want to do. If the things they choose to do is school-realatable than they should get to do it.\n \n A summer break is a kids time to have fun. It's not meant for more things school, it mean that school needs to be as far as possible. Kids should be out playing with their friends, not stuck doing something school realated. Kids should never be forced to do something that they don't want to do. Me, personally I would never take a kids summer break away from them.\n \n It shoud definently be student-designed. One, Adults don't know what us kids like to do. They are just going to merge all grades and expect all of us to get along. Kids should always have a say in what they are going to do. Some parents just make plans for their kids. That is not be the way kids should be treated.\n \n But in my opinion, kids should never have their summer break taken. Also if you make the students do something over summer break than the teachers are going ot have to run it. Then that takes away from everybody, then everybody gets mad. Lastly, no one is going to run it. Which leaves the school in debt because their plan didn't go as planned.\n \n In conclusion, No kids should not have their summer breaks taken away from them. Because kids use summer break as a time away fro school. But, if they do make the kids do this, then it should be kid-designed. If the teachers design it than it won't be as fun for the kids.Â",

    Essay: "Giving students summer projects keeps their brains functioning. Some schools require that students complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. These summer projectsÂ should be teacher-designed because they know the content, have more resources and have more experience.\n \n All teachers know what content they will be teaching giving them an edge to designing summer projects for students. With an understanding of the content they will able to create projects that will be beneficial to the the students. Moreover, the teacher can plan summer projects that include information that the students will learn throughout the school giving the students a head start. For example, a math teacher might give his or her student a math related summer project which will cover topics that will be learn't in the upcoming school year. This makes the project something that will be helpful for the students and keeps their minds working. It will also make their school year easier since they've already learned some topics through the summer project.\n \n Teachers also have more resources to be able to produce summer projects for students to keep them engaged. Many teachers attend workshops and meetings to learn about ways to make their lessons better. This gives them immense amounts of resources they could use to put together helpful summer projects. They also have connections to other teachers and programs that students don't have the access to. These connections are important since they provide useful information. With that said, teachers would produce better summer projects than students would.\n \n Finally, teachers have more experience when it comes to designing projects. A big part of a teachers jobs is to create projects and worksheets for their students all year long. This gives them experience regrading what the students will enjoy and how to plan the projects. They would also know how to assure that the students are learning but in a fun way based off their experience. Teachers go through college to learn all this, so they have a lot of experience and a good understanding of what projects should entail.\n \n However, some might say students should be able to design the summer projects because they are the ones that have to do it. It is true that students are the ones that have to complete the projects but the teachers know what will be better for the students to help benefit them. For example, a student might create a project where they have to play video games. This would not benefit the students in anyway since they will not be learning anything. Therefore, summer projects should be designed by teachers because they know the content, have more resources and have more experience to assure that students continue learning during their break.Â",

    Essay: "Schools do their best to provide best education for all the students. They have various types of summer projects, classes, programs, education tours, online courses and more, that a student can participate on. Some schools even have internships that students get paid from. Some schools assign students their projects to assure, that they continue learning during their break. Most students fail to continue to learn because they have their own personal plans to accomplish during their summer break. But, some students fail to do it because the projects were given from their previous teacher, that they have already had and they do not want to work for them again. They would be more happier to design their own project for the break. The fact that they want to choose their own project is because they want to be more productive and more innovative. Although, summer projects should be student-designed.\n \n Some people might claim that, projects should be school-based and it should be assigned by the teachers because they have the best opinions for the student to work on and they are more relevant. Teachers can evaluate students' weaknesses and give them projects based on what they need, for their own practice and revision session during the break. Teachers should assign project about the course, that they have already completed for more revision and for more details about it. For example, i already completed the earth science course on my freshmen year but, for more details and information about the topic that we discussed, our teacher gave us the project about the climate change and the impact on the environment, during the summer time, so that we can be productive and visualize in our break. Teacher-designed projects are more reliable because the teacher can choose a specific topic for the students' requirement. Some students are naive, they can't come up with a topic and they end up not doing it. Of course, many students will probably disagree on student-designed projects, and claim that teacher-designed topics are way better.Â However, every person has an interest on doing something or every person have a hobby. Moreover, students should be able to decide on what they desire to work on from their own interest or describe about their hobby, writing an essay.\n \n Students should be self-reliance of themselves because self-reliance is the key to success. They should not depend on anyone else, but their heart and the way how they think, that will bring accomplishments to their lives. I understand that teachers are responsible of giving the best topics for students to work on, but i believe that, students have followed all the directions of the teacher, during the entire school-year, but in a long break, it should be the opposite. Teachers should allow students to think of their own and come up with a topic ,and write what they have learned from the teachers. Student-designed projects will help them research about topics and, it will benefit them for the future. It will help them think independently. It will allow them to choose their desired topic and work on their own will. For example, my oceanography teacher allowed us to pick a topic from the board and he gave us an option to choose our own topic too. I managed to pick a topic that i desired, eventually, i completed my project researching and thinking about the topic on my own because i was able to elaborate it myself, since i got to choose the desired topic i want, but some of my classmates had a hard time by only researching because they chose the topic from the board. Furthermore, students can observe from their teacher and get to the point, when they can think for themselves.\n \n It is evidenced that, you can learn a lot from visualization. Most of the students go to trips, during summer time with their family ,and that will be great advantage for a student to come up with a self-designed project, as they visualize on their trip. For example, when you go to the museum, there is lot to visualize and learn from it. Self-designed projects would be complicated for some students, but most importantly, research and your effort, is required. As evidenced by the quote, \"as you sow, so you reap\", it means the harder you work, the better your results will be. We should always remember that, effort is valuable. Self-designed projects are very beneficial because it helps you to work as an independent individual. Furthermore, you will gain the way how you think, both physically and mentally.\n \n In conclusion, teachers should allow students, to think for themselves' ,and allow students to choose their topics. Students-designed projects will help them think more efficiently and it is more convenient for both students and the teacher. Visualization would be an easy hint for the student to work on theirÂ project. For the solution, teachers should assign students to write a journal about, how they spent their time during the long summer break. Potentially, this will make it very easier for both students and the teachers. This will allow student to write about their real-life event ,and it will make the teacher very happy about reading student's personal summer experience.Â",

    Essay: "Summer is already a time where students want a break from school and adding a summer assignment will make students less motivated to do it. If students are able to design their own summer projects they'll have more motivation, use their own creativityÂ and avoid procrastination.\n \n First, students tend to always procrastinate with a lotÂ of homework assignments,especially over big breaks. This can lead to not doing an overall good job on a project, which can then lower students grades. When I was in my freshman year of high school, I had a summer assignment due by the first week of school. I had to read any book that my teacher had put on a list. The list was of super boring poetry books that I had nothing in common with. I had to pick a book so i finally picked this random book, Fly. I didnt want to read this book so I waited until the last week of summer break to read it. Little did I know that I had to write an essay, create a poster about the book and create a short film about it. I was up every night that week trying to complete it last minute. When I got to the first week of school I had received a 78 on the project. This was not the best I could of done, but because I waited last minute I got a low grade. If I had a book that I was interested in this would all of been avoided.\n \n Next, creativity is something that people lack nowadays, they always rely on others to create something for them such as projects, work, etc. If students are challenged to use their own creative minds to create a project it will help them for the future when they need to do these things for jobs. I am someone who hates being told what to do and how to do something, so being able to design my own project will make me want to do it even more. I had a project that I got to design for my chorus class that I was in my sophomore year. I got to create a schedule for elementary school choirs, that was the topic I got to choose myself because it seemed interesting. I did my own research and found the perfect teaching plans for an elementary school choir class. It was such a good project because I was able to create exactly what I was passionate about, but it was still related to the class I was in. The elementary school across the street from my high school liked my ideas so much from my project that this year they use it for their lesson plans.\n \n Lastly, students already have very little motivation to do anything in the summer time. All they want to do is have fun and not have to worry about school projects. Teachers expect us to want to do everything that they assign and thats not always true. If they want to keep students motivated and to do something well done, then teachers should have students do their own work. Forcing us to do something also makes students not motivated. In my sophomore year, I had a few teachers force us to do assignments that were very boring and it made me not motivated to do it at all. If I was able to design my project I would of been happier and not have felt forced to do it. I would of enjoyed working on the project and I would of done my best on it.\n \n It is nice when teachers come up with ideas on assignments because then students will have deadlines to complete it by, its more organized and teachers dont have to worry about students going off topic, but having students pick what they want to do will make a better project overall because students will be more motivated to do it, turn it in on time, not procrastinate and use their own creativity inside of their summer projects.",

Schools that require students to complete a summer project to make sure they continue learning, should have the teachers design the projects, because getting the teachers to choose what their students projects should be about, helps expand the students knowledge, it gives the teacher security that the students will do the project as expected and it also get the students out their own comfort zones.\n \n First, schools that require students to complete a summer project, should have the teachers design the projects, because it will help expand the students knowledge. For example, if students know little to nothing on the topic given to them, they will discover facts they didn't even know existed. In addition, if the students discover interesting facts about the topic given them, it would encourage them to do some more research on the topic; therefore, expanding their knowledge even more than before.\n \n Next, schools that require students to complete a summer project, should have the teachers design the projects, because it will give the teacher security that the students will do the project as expected. For example, if the students were to chose the way they design their projects, it would never get done because they'd procrastinate. However, we can't say for sure that the students will do their summer projects if the topics or the way it is designed is given to them, but we can say for sure it give the teacher the reassurance they need.\n \n Finally, schools that require students to complete a summer project, should have the teachers design the projects, because it also will get the students out their own comfort zones. For example, if students were to chose the way their projects are made or what topic to make it about. It would be about something they have knowledge of, something thats within their comfort zone. Although, most students like to stay within their comfort zones, it's good to expand that comfort. You never know what you might find and catch of interest.\n \n In conclusion, schools that require students to complete a summer project to make sure they continue learning during break, should require the teachers to design the projects because it helps the students expand their knowledge, gives the teacher security that the students will get their projects done during break, and last but not least, it gets the students out of their own comfort zones.",

The one thing students dislike is that schools expecting them to finish up a summer reading project or a math project. They do not like it at all. But, if the students play a part in planning some of those projects and it becomes student-designed, it may persuade the students to actually care about it and possibly build up a good study habit throughout the summer as well.\n \n Student-designed summer projects should take over teacher-designed summer projects due to the fact that student would be interested in perfecting their skills in areas such as reading and writing, which in some cases, those are some of the areas where students struggle at coming back to school. In addition, the students may not feel obligated to do it. They may feel like they have to do this because the school made them do it over the summer to stay focus. If the project was student-designed, the student would feel like the teacher or school is hearing them out. Therefore, the student will do it because they had a piece of input in the project and the teacher/school would not have to worry about most of them not caring about the summer project.\n \n The goal of a school is to ensure that the students are getting the education they need and to help get the students involved more in learning and by having a summer project that is student-designed it would put them one step closer to that goal. For example, if the students were able to help design the project for the summer, they technically still be helping to achieve the schools goal which is to get them ready over the summer.\n \n In conclusion, student-designed projects should replace teachr designed projects because in the student-designed projects would help the students get invovled more during the summer and they would care about it more because they were apart of the process rather than teacher-designed projects which you have to do what the teacher wants you to do.",

    Essay: "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to make sure that students learn throughout summer break. Teachers should design these task so that the projects will actually help students retain and gain knowledge and there will also be exponentially more organization if a teacher were to create the projects. Some would say that students should design summer projects, but there is a great chance that the project the students make will not be focused on academics.\n \n To initiate, teachers should design summer projects because it will allow students to retain and gain information. Schools that allow the students to decide on what they should learn and review over break come to the conclusion of students returning with very minimal knowledge. That leads to the teachers having to spend weeks or even days reviewing! To illustrate, when I was in seventh grade, the teachers decided give the students the freedom to choose what the summer projects should be. It became extremely chaotic and did not help whatsoever. We were forced into a multitude of weeks of spiral review because of that foolish decision. Also, teachers go to college specifically to learn how to educate students in the best way possible. Therefore, they have a lot more experience in lesson planning and teaching in general, so it should absolutely be teachers that create summer project that would be the most beneficial to us.\n \n Furthermore, a teacher, that has far more expertise and credibility in educating, will have a greater sense of organization than a student would. Teachers easily spend hours of their days making plans and lessons for students, so they clearly already have the capability to make the summer projects a lot more thorough and precise with the learning material. Take a look at a teacher's desk. There will be a grand amount of binders, folders, notebooks, and so many other items they use to organize their work. All of their work is categorized to the smallest detail to help make the lessons they create be the most beneficial possible. Now take a look at an average student that has a singular binder with papers shoved everywhere. I can almost guarantee you they will then be searching, for what feels like an eternity, to find an assignment somewhere in the midst of the labyrinth of crumpled papers. This is exactly why a teacher should be the one who designs summer projects.\n \n However, there are people who fully believe that summer projects should be student-designed, but that could not be any farther from the truth. If a student were to create their own summer assignments, then there will most likely be no focus towards academics. The overwhelming majority of students would take the easy way and make their projects be as minimal as possible, so that they could go back to what they wanted to do. Once again, students would come back from break not knowing any more than what they did before. If a teacher designs it, they could have the project spread out through the break to make it not as cumbersome. Then the students would retain the information from the projects rather than them rushing to complete it all at once just to get it over with.\n \n In conclusion, teachers should design these tasks so that the projects help students keep the information that they gain, teachers are also a lot more organized because of the experience they have, and the educators would be capable of making the summer projects a lot more academic than the students.Â",

Usually, these projects are made by teachers, but students should be able to make their own projects. These projects should be student-designed because students will time their time and do it, be creative with the project, and they will be excited about it and learn something new.\n \n As students make their own summer projects, they will take their time and do it. They will choose the topic they want and start planning to make sure everything will look right. They wont feel the need to get it done so quickly. Students will want their projects to look like nice. I had these two friends who were in two different classrooms. The first teacher made the summer project and the second teacher let their students make their own project. The one friend who had the teacher that made the project, she felt like since it was already planned out, that she didnt feel that it was necessary to do it at that moment and she ended up doing it the day before it was due. The second friend who made her own project, she took her time and did it. She planned it out. She finished the project a month early. However, some students who do make their own projects end up doing it a week before its due, but that's better than having it do it a day before. Students will feel that making their own project is better.\n \n With students making their own projects, they'll be creative with it. They'll let their creativity side come out. Students won't feel bored. Since they're designing it, they will have fun with it. They won't feel the need to procrastinate. Students will want to make the project look perfect. My cousin, who had a teacher that let them make their own project, made her project look so colorful and beautiful. She took her time with it. She told me that she didn't rush and that she wanted it to look nice. She told me that before she was never really creative until she did her project. She felt that when doing this project, she was very creative. It surprised her. So, making a student design their summer projects, it shows them how creative they are.\n \n Students will be excited to make their own projects. They'll pick a topic their passionate about. They will learn more about their topic. They'll teach themselves. They will retain new knowledge. They won't be bored. In 7th grade, my teacher gave us a project to do over the summer. It wasn't fun. It was boring. I didn't learn anything new. It was the same thing, I learned in class. It made me not want to do it. So, I forgot about the project the whole summer and I ended up doing it on the first day of school. It was rushed, but I didn't care because it didn't interest me. If I were to do a project that I was going to make, It will make me feel excited about it. It will make me want to do it. I will have picked something I didn't know aboutÂ and from that I will have learned something new. I would want to finish it and see the outcome of it. By the student designing the project, they will be excited and learn something new.\n \n Overall, students designing their own projects is better than the teacher designing it because students will do it and take their time on it, will be creative, and be excited about it and learn something new. They won't feel bored and won't procrastinate. They won't do it a day before it's due. They'll plan and take their time. They'll feel proud about their work.

    Essay: "Remember that moment on the last day of school, right before summer break? Remember the mid-day naps and late nights spent with friends? Remember the horrifying moment of realization that your summer project is due in less than a week; and you haven't even started? Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure the continuation of learning over their break. Summer projects should be student-designed because it allows the student to choose a project according to their own personal interest, it would be less confusing for the student and parent(s), and the student is more likely to prepare and produce a quality project.\n \n Many families have exciting activities planned for the summer time. They travel and explore new things with their children, helping the kids develop an interest in different things and the desire to discuss them. Allowing students to choose and design their own projects gives them the opportunity to express their interests. It also allows the teacher to evaluate their skills and learn about the student. My cousin is very fond of rocks andÂ the rock cycle. For his summer project, his teacher allowed him to design it himself and he created an elaborate project on the rock cycle. His teacher later contacted his mother and praised him on his creativity and knowledge of rocks. Through the use of student-designed projects, the teacher was able to discuss the areas that he needed improvement in and identify his interest.\n \n Doing work that teachers give you can be difficult, especially if they aren't around to help clarify their requirements. Student-designed projects would be more efficient because it would be less confusing on the students and the parents. Parents often attempt to assist their children with their projects, but it can be difficult understanding what is needed and sometimes the child ends up receiving a low score. Last year, I had a summer project prompt that I didn't understand. Naturally, I went to my mother for help. She gave great advice and answered my questions, but when I turned in the project I received a sixty-seven. The teacher said that I hadn't answered the prompt correctly. I was confused because my mother had helped me with the prompt. The teacher sat down and explained what it was she was looking for and gave me the opportunity to make up my grade. If my project had been student-designed, the teacher would've had minimal involvement in the project allowing me to put it together in a way I would have understood, eliminating confusion.\n \n No one likes being rushed to do things they don't feel like doing. Students are more likely to prepare and produce a quality project if it is something they want to do. Most students struggle with time management for the simple fact that the things they need to do aren't interesting. There's homework, chores and sometimes work. Summer projects shouldn't be another boring task assigned by a teacher, it should be up to the student. When you give the student control over their task they will want to complete it in a timely fashion and they will make sure it is their very best work because they want to take pride in its uniqueness. It's like dance competitions. The dancers are allowed to choreograph whatever they want as long as the dance fits the assigned dance style. They are then graded on technique, creativity, and skill. If schools made summer projects student-designed, students would be more motivated to do them because they can make them as interactive and different as they want.\n \n Having summer projects helps the teacher keep track of the progress of learning over the summer. Summer projects should be a simple way for students to express their interest and have fun.",

    Essay: "The summer project should be Teacher-designed because the teacher knows more about the subject than students do. the main reason why a summer project would be assigned is for students to continue their learning career during break. Most school projects are usually not hard but time consuming. They really help students to not forget about what they are learning about. In the summer time, students tend to take their whole mind off school because there is no work to do, but if they have a project to do, its easier to keep your mind on the subject your learning.\n \n If the teacher was the creator of the project, it would be so much more straight forward and exactly on the topic that he or she was going for. The reason why it wouldn't be a good idea for a student to create the project is because it may not be what the teacher wants us to learn, for example, if we are going to read a summer book, and then write a summary on the book; the student can choose a book that: they already read, a very short book, or a book that has nothing to do with the topics they learned about. If the teacher assigned the book, She would let them read and study a book she thinks is best for what they learned over the year.\n \n Another point about why teachers should be the one who designs the projects is because, They have more knowledge about the topic. For example, my history teacher gave us a project to do on world war II, and we had the choice to either create the project ourselves, or for the teacher to design it for us. We had one week to decide either or not we should design it or not, so we made a chart. The outcome of this chart should us that it would be best if the teacher designed it for us. The reasons for letting our teacher design for us was: the teacher is gonna be grading it so we want to know how to do it right, if we were the ones to design the project, and everyone in the class has a different subject, then it would be very confusing on the teacher to grade or talk about in class when we come back in the summer.\n \n The only reason I feel like would be a better idea if the students designed the project is because it gives more creativity for the students. The problem about that is, the student can do the project the way the teacher does not want it to be made. I think the best way to handle this situation is if the teacher gave the students a specific topic and specific rules to the project. In that case the student can be creative but at the same time, the teacher would be able to grade it and talk about it in the class for everyone to listen, because everyone's project would be on the same subject.\n \n In conclusion, the teacher should design the project because, it would give the student a better understanding on the subject that the class is learning about. Students would have a broader thought about what they learned about in that class. They would not forget about what they learned, and they would keep it in mind through out the whole year. It is honestly hard to remember everything you learned during the year, so summer projects are great for students, if the teacher was the one who designed it.",

    Essay: "Would you rather want a teacher-designed summer project or would you rather design your own summer project?\n \n Well In my opinion I think summer projects should be a teacher-designed because It can be easier for kids and more kids would most likely complete their projects faster.\n \n Having a teacher-designed project can be very easier for kids who dont like doing any work. For example, some people are really lazy and just need a little push, so If any teacher consider doing a teacher-designed project It will give the kids the push they need to completing their project. Even though kids like to complain alot maybe this would stop them from complaining and actually finish there project, you also can get a good grade.\n \n Another reason to having a teacher-designed project will be more kids will be able to complete their projects faster. For example, I dont like doing projects because It take me to long to complete, I will probably miss the dead line to turn It in,and even though Its my design It takes time. If my teacher was helping me In some type of way I would complete my project faster,turn It In on the dead line, and get a good grade on It.\n \n Some people say that student-designed projects can get you thinking or you can be creative. However It will take you way longer to complete. For example, If I was doing a project I would have to think about what I wanted to do and get my supplies that I would need, but If it was a teacher-designed project all I would have to do Is get the supplies I needed to complete the project.\n \n In conclusion, summer projects should be designed by your teacher because it can be easier and more kids will complete their projects faster. Know you have read my response teachers should try to consider making summer projects that Is more teacher-designed then student-designed.",

    Essay: "Summer is the only 3 months of the year that you dont have to wake up first thing in the morning and go to school. Summer is what every student is looking forward to. The thought of a 3 month break just keeps students pushing through the year, We work so hard during the school year, and finally, we get to relax during summer.\n \n There is only one major problem with summer. Since it is over a extended period of time of 3 months, kids do not remember all the lessons and all the information that they had learned over the 9 months they were in school. Of course we still have the knowledge in our heads. We just need to be reminded, or do semi-frequent reviews on things you did during the school year. All of the important things with stay in your head if you remind it to not forget the things you have put in it.\n \n Every student thinks differently and has different mind sets. Sometimes kids forget all of what they learned during the school year, just over 3 months. But when they are reminded of all of the things they had learned it is refreshed. But their just isnt enough time during the school year, to both refresh your brain from last years lessons, and teach you all of the lessons for this year.\n \n There are a many of ways to solve this problem, but not everyone should have the same solution. Different students take a certain amount of time, and a certain amount of energy put into them. To keep all of the lessons fromÂ the previous year refreshed. The solution has to be found by the student not the teacher.\n \n One option brought up by teachers, You must have homework over the summer. For example summer projects or review packets from the previous year. But, students should have a say on this, after all we have been slaving away for 9 months. All the students want is a break. But they will have the opportunity to either keep learning during the summer or just do these projects or packets as reviews so they are all caught up and ahead of the game for the upcoming school year.\n \n After all it us the students break, They should be the ones deciding their projects. However much effort they want to put in, is how much they get out these projects. But these projects would keep you up to date and if you really wanted to you could go further and learn ahead.\n \n If these projects were teacher based, It would feel as if you are still in school. Giving the student the freedom of creating and picking their own project makes then feel like they are doing these projects fun. Because some summer days can get very boring. These projects that the student either picked or created is helping them both learn more and review from the previous school year. They will not forget as much of the information they put so much time and effort into getting in their brain, they do not want to lose it.\n \n It would be better if these \"summer projects\" were not projects but just seldom reviews. Just every one in a while go review or look over your old text books, that way you will not have to be reminded during the school year and waste time and effort. Just a couple times a week during the summer, you will be refreshed of all the things you learned that were in that text book.",

    Essay: "In our world, many school are now requiring students to complete their summer projects so they could assure them to continue learning during their break. However, now they having a troubling tie deciding if school projects should be teacher-designed, or student-designed. The two controversy bias options have been growing in demand deciding which one would further help students with their academics. Summer projects should be student-designed because students will be able to choose a project that appeals to them and be able to continue learning about.\n \n School projects should be considered to be student designed because students will be able to choose their own project that should appeal to them. If students don't get to choose and project they want, how will they even be motivated to learn about it? Students should able to find a project that is considered enough for them to work on, so they could be motivated enough to study. This then, help the students to learn more about their project and also help them conduct their own experiment with them, and finally this can help them to present their work showing what they have done. For example; if say a person chooses to a mini volcano project, he would first have to find out how to make it, then he have to study about how it works, and finally how will he summarize it on what id does or how an eruptions occurs. This can give a great start on what they choose to do or plans to do.\n \n Next, school projects should be student-designed because students will be able to share and present their projects in class. This can help benefit both the students and teachers because the students are showing knowledge about their project, while teachers administer them to see what they have learned about. In the end, this will let teachers and school that student-designed projects are much more beneficial than teacher- designed projects. This can soon increase the chance's of choosing school-designed projects over the next couple decades. Leaning towards the future, many students will continue this and succeed in their academic or future jobs.\n \n Students projects should be teacher designed to many students because teachers can choose project's they choose for their class and teachers can decide how toughÂ they should be. However, if the teachers do decide to do this, theÂ students will then not be able to understand what to do, they will not be able to do the project, and they can be very relectutant enough to do the project. Instead, what the schools' can do is let the projects be student-designed so, students will be able to choose a project that appeals to them and be able to continue learning about. From this, many students wouldÂ work on their projects, be motivated and end up work as hard as they can to do well in their academics. This will soon give a bright future towards all the students and a time for all the teachers to relax.\n \n In conclusion, schools should decide school projects should be student-designed because students will be able to choose a project that appeals to them and for them to be able to continue learning about. Towards the end, this bring's up students grades, achieve their dream goals, and help them and their school for choosing the right choice of what they have to do for the students school projects. This will then do a better job of taking care of the students and helping them retain their knowledge over break in a better manner than teacher-designed projects. In the other hand students than can support each other in taking in these projects and move further on working as groups or working in a competitive way, seeing who will get the better made. In the end, towards everything this new decision should be able to help everyoneÂ world widely.",

    Essay: "Schools requiring students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break isn't a bad idea, but should the projects assigned be teacher-designed or student-designed? I personally, as a student would much rather prefer a student-designed project over a teacher-designed project. A lot of benefits come from letting students design their own projects. The continuation of students learning during their break is in fact important, however, students should be given the option to design their own projects that they will enjoy constructing during their brake. Students including my self don't always tend to understand instructions given to us by a teacher, so, who would students go to if they were ever confused about a certain task that had to be done on the projects designed by their teachers?\n \n Students designing their own summer projects benefits students, teachers, and schools. As students are designing their projects, teachers have now saved time. Teachers no longer have to take time out of their day to plan these projects for their students over the summer. Students are gaining knowledge by practicing their creativity, planning and organization. While students are constructing these projects they're always learning something new whether it's from the research the student did or the materials used, the point is, students are benefiting from these projects as well. Schools now have teachers with more time to make the school a better place by being prepared for when the students come back from break and they now have smarter and brighter students who've been learning new things over the summer.\n \n Yes, It's true, a student would much rather prefer not doing ANY projects over the summer, but if they were given the option to do a project of their choice that they design, they will complete it and they would enjoy doing it. No one wants to have a boring summer break and if students are assigned projects they should be at least able to design there own so they can have fun completing them. You'd be surprise about how creative students can get and that's what makes it fun for students. Students have a variety of choices to design a project, like online projects, poster board projects, try fold projects, etc. Learning and having fun at the same time during their summer break doesn't sound too bad after all.\n \n Who or where would a student go to if they had a question about one of their projects that was assigned and designed by their teachers? Yes, now a days we have technology that helps us communicate, but not all students can purchase a device or their parents/guardians can't afford to purchase their children an electronic device. A student designed project would prevent all of those problems. It saves busy parents' time from having to drive their children to the school to ask questions about the projects they were assigned over the summer. With a student-designed project students would be able to put all their ideas on their projects with out having any questions because they designed it.",

    Essay: "Some schools have summer projects so they can make sure their students still remember what they learned. I think these summer projects should be teacher-designed because if students designed them they would be super easy and the students wouldn't be remembering anything as well if the teacher made it. If teachers already design work for the students then it wouldn't be as difficult for them to make the summer projects. And teachers making them would mean a lesser chance of cheating\n \n If students were to design summer projects for themselves then they wouldn't be remembering as much if teachers design it because students would just make the work really easy so they wouldn't have to do much. Also if students made them then there would be a higher chance of the students cheating because a student could make something that is very similar to another students work and the teacher wouldn't even know. And the students could have just thought of the same idea and then they turn it in and the teacher thinks they cheated when it was just a coincidence so they get in trouble for thinking similarly.\n \n If teachers designed them then it would be less work on the students and the teacher and the teachers already make work for the students. the way it would be less work for the students is they wouldn't have to think about what they're going to make they would just have to think about how they are going to do it. And teachers would have less work because they would know a general idea of what they were grading instead of it being something the student made up. Also teachers already make work for the students so they are used to it. And if teachers made them there would be less chances of cheating because the teacher made the work so she would know if the students were copying from each other\n \n Those are some reasons why teachers should make the summer projects instead of the student. So it might be a bit more work for the teacher but it's overall better for everyone because the students get to remember the information they learned and the teachers get to do less work when they have to grade it.",

    Essay: "Summer projects are seen as a way to make sure that students are learning. These summer projects are usually teacher-designed. It is a valid opinion to believe that the projects should be teacher-designed. There are many reasons for the projects to be designed by teachers. The students could easily pick simplistic projects that do not give them any type of learning experience. Teachers know more about the topic and could give them different ways of learning. Lastly, students can easily forget to do something when they are responsible for the outline or design for an assignment that is usually given and made by a teacher.\n \n Students over the summer usually want to save time for leisure activities. When the idea of school comes into the minds of these students, it can be seen as agitating. When you add the freedom to make your own project the way you want, there can be downsides for the student and the teacher. Since many students want to minimize stress during their break, they could easily make a project that makes the work appear as effortless. This effortless mindset usually produces work that is mediocre and possibly doesn't go into detail about what the project is about. This could anger teacher and make their assigned project appear to be pointless. The student's work would have no benefit to their grade or their opportunity to learn.\n \n As a teacher, it should be necessary to keep your students focused on the topic that is at hand. Some teachers will even go out of their way to do this by giving a project over the summer. Many teachers give these projects to students with additional options designed by them. This is logical, due to the fact that a teacher knows a lot more about the topic of the project than the student. The job of the teacher is to find a way to make the information adhere to the student's mind. The teacher's perspective will give the student different ways to learn the material while keeping them interested and busy over the summer. In my experience, I found that I was more motivated to do a summer project and learn more about the material when I had different ways of learning it through the teacher's direction. When doing a summer reading project, I had read the book but found little interest in finding a way to incorporate my own creativity into the project. It was much easier to just read the directions given from the teacher and it also made me learn the theme and main topic of the book more adequately.\n \n Responsibility is a necessary thing for students to have. But it is very common to find students overwhelmed with this new foundÂ freedom. Many people forget to do things when it is necessary for them to do it without guidelines or specific criteria they have to meet. Sometimes it's not that they forget, but that they are totally frustrated with the idea that they have no assistance on the project. This could be especially troubling over the summer as students are more focused on enjoying their break. The idea that they have to do something on their own without any prior information can be overlooked. When doing a project for a pre-IB class I found that it was easier to do when I had guild linesÂ to measure up to and it wasn't just a time for me to implore on my creative talents in order to get something done.\n \n Summer projects are something to make sure students keep learning over their break. It's clear to see that teacher-designed projects are much more efficient. Without the guidance of teachers, students could make simplistic projects that offer no benefit for the teacher or student. The teacher's knowledge about the project could make it helpful for their students to keep learning different ways about the material. It is also common for students to forget or lose interest when they are given too much responsibility for an assignment. Student-designed projects can leave room for a large quantity of errors and mistakes that could ultimately defeat the purpose of a project. Therefore, teacher- designed projects are better in the sense that they can keep the student learning as if they are still in school but give them time to enjoy the benefits that come with summer break.Â Â  Â  Â",

    Essay: "The word \"Summer\" brings a lot of feelings of excitement. Kids across America know summer to be a time of freedom, and a break from school. Recently, some schools are requiring students to participate in summer projects. These projects are used to continue student educate year round, opposed to the regular school year. Some schools feel the need to determine the project for the students, instead of allow exploration into interests. Other school allow for schools allow for student-designed projects, in whichÂ students are able to form their own project, and delve into what intrigues them. I believe student-designed projects are more beneficial to education because, they would be relevant to student interest, and allow for creative exploration;teachers must check student-designed projects for educational content.\n \n School can feel like a rut,however, summer can turn that rut into a mountain of good feeling. Some topics covered in the classrooms have no benefit beyond the test, and a teacher-designed project would be no different. Most kids don't appreciate being forced into any sort of work, especially during their months off, so providing a predetermined project would not peak a students interest. If something isn't interesting to the student, are they truly learning? allow students to formulate their own project, and plan it out would create a better passion for education, and their summer work. When students find their work relevant, they work harder, and in return learn more. Since learning more is the whole goal, I see a clear argument for student exploration during the summer months. When students are left are able to pursue their interest, you will find an increase in creativity.\n \n Everyone likes to picture themselves as a free thinking, and it can be hard to channel that in a traditional high schoolÂ environment. Allowing students to investigate their passions will result in increased creativity, along with better work. As they begin exploration into their projects, they will feel better about the whole working over summer idea. With their own interests at the heart of their projects, students will be able to come up wtih more creative,and innovative project ideas. As the find themselves deeper in their left hemisphere, they will be faced with increased problem that will be unique to their situation. Since all students will be completing personal unique projects, they won't be able to rely on others for direct solutions to their problems, which will increase problem solving skills. With increased student freedom, comes the downside of noneducational content.\n \n Students may get a little off topic with their first attempt at a student-designed project. While I believe student freedom is important, I also feel their should be strict guidelines to maintain educational value. Since summer is a time for students freedom, all students are going to search for the easy way to avoid work during their break. It's the heart of our nature. This can easily be avoided by guidelines, and teacher approval on their proposed project. Teachers must find their investigation education, and discover the value in their topics, while allowing for an open mind, not to control students. Teacher approval will allow for the educational value to be present, while allowing students to explore their interests. This balance between education, and freedom will maximize summer project learning potential.\n \n Education is a fine line between interests, and true value. summer projects are meant to increase value, but teacher-designed projects can weaken interest. No students likes following the same instruction through the school year, and keeping that procedure during summer projects would be painful for students. They would not find teacher-designed projects relevant, which would lower interest in their project. Without interest, students would lose educational value through teacher projects. Student-designed projects are the happy medium for summer work. Student-designed projects would better educate because, they would be relevant to student interest, and allow for creative exploration,however, teachers must approve students' projects in order to maintain education value.Â",

    Essay: "Summertime is a time for students to take a break from school. Taking a break, however, comes at a cost. During summer, students tend to forget things they learned in the past school year. This is why some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure students continue learning, even during summer. These projects should be student based because it can be used as incentive to work,Â gives students more options, and makes sure everyone can do them. When it comes to summertime learning, students should be in control. When students design their own projects, everybody wins.\n \n During summer, it's hard to do school work when there's no school. Some students may find it hard to find ways to work while others may not even try. Giving students the ability to choose what to do can combat this problem by giving them incentive to work. When giving students the ability to choose, they are more likely to work on the projects. In addition, not only will they want to do the projects, but enjoy them, since the assignments are on the student's terms. Giving students more freedom when it comes to learning can strengthen their minds and help them grow.\n \n When the projects are teacher-designed, that means every student gets the same prompt. While this might be fine for some students, there's no way of satisfying every student. Letting students design their projects can make sure every student does what they want. If students were to design their own projects, then every student can be satisfied with what they do. Student-designed projects can also create diversity, ensuring every student's project is different in their own way. More choice when it comes to projects makes students more prone towards things they want to learn and might be able to learn new skills.\n \n Another problem students may face is the inability to do the projects. While some students may be able to accomplish the objectives of the projects, others might be incapable. Letting students design their own projects makes everyone capable of completing them. When designing their own projects, students will work with the resources around them and make sure that the project is able to be accomplished. At some point if the student runs into a problem, instead of going through the hassle of contacting a teacher and figuring out what can be changed, they can change the projects to their own standards, saving time and energy. Some people, however, may not agree with these reasons.\n \n People can still argue that teacher-designed projects are more successful. While it is true that if teachers designed the projects, every student will at least have something to work on, teacher-designed projects aren't the better option. Even though every student has a project idea, not every student has the means of accomplishing them. Even if they were, there's no tell whether they will like doing it or not. Students that don't like the project are more reluctant to finish or even start. While teacher-designed projects have one advantage, they also have many disadvantages.\n \n In conclusion, students should be in charge of designing their own projects during the summer. First, student-designed projects can give more incentive to students and encourage them to complete their projects. Second, student-designed projects give more options and freedom to students. Finally, giving students the ability to choose their own projects makes sure that each student can complete their projects. When it comes to summertime learning, students should be in control.",

    Essay: "Why should summer be about learning if that is the purpose of school? Students go to school for most of the year and than they get a break, but are forced to do a project on a matter they may or may not like. Summer projects should be student-designed because students will have a lack of motivation if it's on a subject they don't like, they can pick their own project ideas with in reason of the school,andÂ students can be learn to think independentlyÂ from there teachers and make their own decisions\n \n Students will lack the motivation to do a project if it's not on a subjects like because they believe that the subject as no value orÂ purpose for them. For example,a student gets a list of project ideas they must choose from,but they don't like any of the ideas on the list; they still have pick a subject even though they don't find any value. The student will ignore the project because they think the idea is as no value or purpose to what they want to do in life. The subject on which the project is on was on value or purpose to the student because it was nothing to do on what they value or purpose in their education. Another example is,a student does a project on what a teacher thinks is a valuable lesson that they should learn about, but the student thinks the opposite but is told to find reasons on why the lesson is valuable. If a student was to pick their own subject on the project they would have more motivation because it has more value and purpose than on something that their teacher thinks is valuable and purposeful to them. Students would find better motivation to do the project now that they can do it now what they if valuable and purposeful. This shows that students will lack motivation to do a project if it was teacher-designed because the subjects that teacher pick have no value or purpose to a students education,and that students-designed will give a student more motivation to do something that they find valuable and purposeful than on a subject that can't express themselves on.\n \n Students can pick their own project ideas instead of the teachers ideas because students may have some better ideas than the teachers do. For example, a student wants to do a project on the important'sÂ of sleep in teens, but that isn't in the teachers list of ideas; it limits the students imaginationÂ and creativity; the teacher could have lost out on the opportunity to read or hear about a good subject. This limits the students imagination and creativity by limiting them to project ideas that have been over and over again and their creativity with old subjects and putting it into more modern or in a differentÂ way of approaching that same idea. If the students were to stick with the same project ideas and never use their imagination and creativity and would never learn different ways to approach on a topic that many people have seen, but never in a different way. This shows that students picking their own project ideas is a way to use their imagination and creativity and approach new or same ideas just differently is better than a teacher-design because teacher can get better topics from their students and use them for new students to come and not use the same ideas over and over again. The student and the teacher are two different groups,so what the teacher thinks is a good project idea is not the same for a student because they think differently.\n \n If summer projects were teacher-designed than it doesn't allow the student to think of these ideas them themselves. The students are relying on the teachers to pick the ideas, so they will never have to think for themselves, but if the the projects were student-designed that would allow the students to think for themselves and make their own decisions. For example, teachers allow the students to chose ideas and teach them to be independent from them and suffer the conquensensÂ if they don't chose a subject. The students learn the independence from teachers because they won't always have a teacher to depend on when they are out of school. This shows that being independent from the teacher is important because it teaches students to rely on themselves later in life.\n \n Summer projects should be student-designed because students will have a lack of motivation if it's on a subject they don't like, they can pick their own project ideas with in reason of the school,andÂ students can be learn to think independentlyÂ from there teachers and make their own decisions. Students learn to use and expand their imagination and creativity if they can think for themselves and it also teaches them to be independent from teachers because the won't always have them in the future.",

    Essay: "Are you tired of rushing to get summer assignments done the week before school starts? Do you feel like summer assignments are just causing you more stress? How much information do you really remember from summer assignments when you go back to school? As students we all dread the strenuous summer assignments given at the end of the school year that help us prepare for our classes in the upcoming fall semester. These assignments often feel like a restriction from our fun summers that we have had planned for months. Students often put these assignments off until the very last minute, when school is getting ready to start again. There must be a way to make summer assignments for enjoyable for the students while still preparing them for their new courses. Summer assignments should be student designed because students can learn in a style that is best for them, they can space out the work load, and they can make it fun and enjoyable.\n \n Summer assignments should be student designed because it allows the students to learn in a style that works best for them. Many teachers assign long packets and textbook readings, which provide all the information needed, but it might not be the most efficient way to get the information to stay in the students long-term memory. Students learn in all different ways, some students learn better by reading information, others learn better by writing down the information, as wellÂ as some students learn better by hearing or working hands on with the information. Students are more likely to remember the information when it is provided to them in a way that is interesting and intriguing to them. Letting summer assignments be student designed allows the students become more creative outside of the classroom for example there are students that learn best by reading textbooks but other may excel in learning by creating a poster, an info graphic, or even a hands on model.\n \n Another reason why summer assignments should be student designed is because they can space out the work load. At the the start of summer most students are not thinking about doing their summer assignments. They just got out of school and they certainly do not want to focus on doing more work. If the summer assignments were student designed the student would know exactly how much work they have to get done for each class and they could approximate how long it would take them to complete it. This would encourage students to be more responsible for getting their work done and become more organized. The students would be able to plan out when they would need to the work and how the could evenly space it out so that they are still learning, but also enjoying their time off from school. Although there would still be students who would not do their work, or they would wait until the last minute to do their work, it teaches students to be more responsible and they would learn how to manage their time more efficiently.\n \n The last reason why summer assignments should be student designed is because the students can make it more fun. We all know that school work is not the most enjoyable thing, but it is especially not enjoyable when you have to do it during the summer. There are some more enjoyable ways of learning than just reading from a text book and pulling out the important information. If the students were able to design their summer assignments, they could look forward to doing them, because they are exciting and it would be something that the students want to do, not forced to do. It is psychologicallyÂ proven that people enjoy things more when it is not forced upon them to complete a task, so shouldn't that be the same for summer assignments? If students were able to design their summer assignments they would pay more attention when completing it and the information would have a greater chance of being encoded in their long-term memory, for when the school year starts again.\n \n Student would be better off if summer assignments were student designed because they can choose how they want to learn, they can manage their time and work load, and they can enjoy it while doing it. I think both teachers and students can agree that summer assignments are dreadful to complete and grade, so why not make it more enjoyable on both sides. Would you rather have students complete a summer assignment in a fun, creative way, or make it feel like a task, where they are least likely to retain any of the information given to them? School is stressful enough as it is, so why have that stress carry into the summer.",

    Essay: "Summer is usually where I have most of my fun. I am always working, playing football, and hanging out with friends. Usually I dedicate most of my free time to things I love doing on my break, but sometimes when I have to do school related things, I like when I get to pick the summer project rather than the teacher to pick it. I think if the students get to pick the summer projects they want to do, it will probably lead to a better and more exciting project rather then a boring project which was required to do.\n \n I think if most students get to pick the summer project they want to do, they will find their topic more interesting, therefore making the project more enjoyable. If the summer projects become more enjoyable, students would actually want to them and not forget or ignore the projects until school starts back again. Especially since students are on summer vacation, most students will not do anything school-related or even the projects, but if they do it on something they enjoy, they would likely do it instead of slacking off. Students who tend to hate school may do projects if the projects are based on something they like or something they find interesting. Most students would actually have a passion and might even enjoy the projects they get to pick to do in the summers.\n \n I also believe the students will have more fun doing summer projects they enjoy rather than what the teacher picks for the students . Since students have more freedom and more say on what topics their summer projects will be on, I think the students would put more effort and more excitement into the summer projects. Projects that tend to be interested by the students can lead to a better projects since the students actually know the topics they like and choose those topics to do summer projects on them. Making summer projects more enjoyable could lead to students maybe liking school due to the freedom they get to pick went they choose their own summer projects instead of the teacher assigning the topics. And since the students get to pick their own topics, they will have more passion doing the projects, therefore leading to better projects and grades for the students and easier grading and less work for teachers.\n \n Lastly I believe that if students go to pick their own summer topics for their projects, they will finish it quicker and get it over with as soon as possible instead of waiting last minute to complete the projects. Since the students get to pick their projects, they would be able to finish it in no time due to their topic being interesting and their topics being enjoyable. Since students would most likely pick a topic they enjoy, their knowledge of the topic might be big or they might do a lot of research due to they wanting to find new information out, thus helping them finish this project easier and faster than other projects. Some people think that if teachers gave out topics for summer projects it would be more educational and better, but these people are wrong because if the students got to pick out there summer project topics, they would be able to enjoy it a little more and it would be more enjoyable to the students. Also if the students got to pick their topics for their summer projects, they would probably get it done with quickly so they could be able to do a lot more activities like hanging out with people or play sports or even work and since the topic they picked was something they had interested in, they would be glad to get it over with.\n \n In conclusion, all these reasons that were stated in this essay are good reasons on why schools should let the students pick their topics for summer projects instead of the teaching picking them out for them. Letting the students pick what topics they want to do for summer is an easier way to make the projects more exciting and better learning for the students. People should care about letting the students pick their topics because if they want to research more about a certain topic, this will allow them to able to research it more in depth and help the knowledge of the student grow more.Â",

    Essay: "Summer projects should be student designed, because it's Summer break, most student's won't be doing work. They are most likely to be outside in the pool, at the park and playing sports. But because of that student's should be required to work on the project at leastÂ once a week every week until the due date of the project.\n \n Working on a student designed project could be more beneficial and encourage creativity and inspire many great idea's. because during Summer break because during break student's have more time and more creativity and inspiration, especially when it's student designed, every project would be unique and different according to the type of summer the student had, If they had a happy fun, filled summer the project could be fun and playful but if the student had a layed back and chill summer the project could reflect that and being chilled and layed back.\n \n It could also prevent cheating, and expose cheater's. As if two student's come back to school with the same project it's most likely they cheated. because whats most likely going to happen is the students who dont do any work will cheat and copy off of the students who took valuable time out of their summer. So student designed projects could eliminate the problem of cheating and copying.\n \n In the end I find student designed project's are more better and more beneficial than teacher designed projects, as student projects are more creative and more inspiring for the student's.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

    Essay: "Dear Mr. Generic_Name\n \n Have you ever got a project and struggled with it so much because it was a certain part you didnt understand about the project? And you just thought to yourself \"if i could of picked what i had to do for my project i wouldnt struggle with none of the project i would get a good grade!\". If students could pick their own projects it would be creativity! Some schools are requiring students to complete a summer project over break, that way they can still learn while on break. However, they cant decide whetherÂ they want the summer project to be teacher design or student design. The summer project would be a better understanding for the students if it were to be student design. This way would be giving the teachers an understanding of how their students think on their own, And this is giving the teachers a way to help the students pass their class by letting them do something they enjoy and desire to do, Also letting the students decide what they would want to do for their summer project would encourage a lot of students to actually do the project!\n \n Its important for teachers to know what their students enjoy during far as learning actives for school. If students had a chance to design their own project it would show teachers their learning desires When i say that Im talking about what type of strategiesÂ students use to study for their tests, what actives do they prefer to do for a classwork grade, etc. This way teachers can figure out what would make more of their students pay attention during the lesson. Some students struggle so much because they dont understand certain things in school because of the way it is being taught to them. If students were allow to design their summer project it would give teachers a way to help their students be successfulÂ and pass their class. TeachersÂ would have a much more understanding onceÂ they see howÂ they prefer to do the work that they are being graded for.\n \n Teachers need to see the best way they can get their students to enjoy their class. It is important for the students to be engage in the class. For an example you are not going to pay attention to something that does not interest you. If the teacher knew what type of stuff interest the students they would know what type of stuff they would need bring to bring up when they are trying to teach the students. A lot of students fall asleep in class often because they are not engaged in the lesson. Letting the students design their own summer project could not only be a good thing the students but also a good thing the teachers. So many kids would learn so much just by paying attention because the teacher now has a better understanding on how to go about the lesson. Now a days students are receiving homework and not returning the homework in for their grade, and i know exactly why its tactics. Kids dont like paper pencil work, they much rather use the computer. For insist say i were a teacher and i were to say,\n \n \"OK class go home and in your notebook copy twenty of the vocabulary words down with the definitions. Fifty percent of the students would not complete that assignment. However if i were to say\n \n \"Class i want you to download this flash cards app on your phone or computer and design your own flash cards and show me once your done so i can give you the grade for that assignment\". Ninety percent of the students would complete that flash card app assignment. Because kids are interest in stuff you make fun for them to do and things that they are exciting for them!\n \n If teachers are granted to design the summer project most likely most students arent going to complete the project. Its not that students dont enjoy learning or completing their work, its simply that students struggle doing things they have no interest in. Its the teacher job to teach the students and make it interesting for them. If students were granted to design their summer project, It would encourage a lot of students to actually complete their project over the summer. When your teacher gives you an opportunity to express yourself and allow to receive a grade for it. That means a lot to most students. To some students teachers dont care enough to actually encourage students to engage with lessons. Being that students would haveÂ a chance to express their selves by completing a project would encourage the student to enjoy the lessons, the classwork, the homework, projects, andÂ so on in that class.\n \n If the summer project were to be student designed it would give teachers a better understanding on their students, Also it would teach teachers some ways to help students be engaged during the lessons,And it would definitely encourage more students to complete their projects in the future. Thank you for taking the time out your day to read my letter, I know my daughter will understand your decisions .\n \n Sincerely ,\n \n Generic_NameÂ  Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â",

    Essay: "Some schools require students to complete summer projects assure they keep learning during break. I believe that these projects should be teacher designed. It has many more benefits to be teacher designed than student designed. It would also be easier on the students than making them design their own project.\n \n Firstly, it would be easier for the students to have a set criteria for the projects made by the teacher. If the students were to design the projects there would be more freedom, but also more room for error. the teacher designed projects would be easier to follow and help with getting the information they need to continue learning over summer break.\n \n Furthermore, the assurance of the students continuation of learningÂ over the summer is greatly increased. The teachers would be able to give the right information needed to do the projects. If the students were to design these projects it could not run as smoothly as it needs to; they could also get the wrong information.\n \n However, if the projects were to be student design, there could be benefits to it. There would be lots of room for creativity and originality. The students might have a better sense of freedom on the projects and it could possibly make them work better. Also, being able to design it themselves could instill a greater passion for working on the project. The possibility of being original with the project design could also lead to a better assurance that the students will still learn over the summer.\n \n In conclusion, the projects should be designed by the teachers. It gives better assurance to keep students learning. It also assures that they are getting the right information needed. It is also mainly easier on the students ability to do the project. The teacher designed projects provide the best assurance that the students have a continuation of learning over summer break.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â",

Summer projects should be student-designed, this would make the projects feel more personal.\n \n If students could design their own projects they would be more motivated to work on them. I once was assigned a summer project about whales, a topic I'm not really interested in. I didn't really worked on the project during break and waited until the last week of break to work on it and didn't really do my best on it. If students choose to do their projects about a topic they are passionate about, they will be more motivated to learn more about the topic and work on the project.\n \n Students should design a project they would feel confident doing. Everyone is different and every student is interested in a different topic. My sister was assigned a project about cooking, that is something she enjoys a lot, she finished the project the same day it was assigned. She already knew a lot about the topic but she learned more while doing the project and she felt confident doing it. Students could feel better doing a project about a topic they already know a little and want to learn more about.\n \n The projects they would design would let them have fun and learn while doing the project. I usually have more fun doing projects about topics I like to learn about. I learn a lot more when I'm interested in what my project is about.

    Essay: "Summer is a time of hanging out with friends at the beach and relaxing in the warm weather, but there is always something that swoops in to mess it up: a summer project. Summer projects are not all bad, for they are designed to ensure that students continue to learn during their three month getaway from school. However, who should design the summer project the student or the teacher? Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers have more experience with projects than students, and students will lean toward designing a quick and easy project.\n \n Teachers have had more encounters with school assigned projects in their lifetime than their students. Most teachers have college degrees. They have done the twelve plus years of primary school to graduate, and then gone on to college and done two to four more years to get their degree. Through all that schooling many projects have been assigned and completed. All of this gives teachers the proper experience and background to come up with a well designed summer project for their students. Just this past summer my computer system networking teacher, Mr. Generic_Name, assigned us a project. It was a review project incorporating all of the course material from my sophomore year that he did not want us to forget during the summer. I remember how well rounded of a project it was, so much so that I had to ask him how he come up with it. Mr. Generic_Name told me that the project was inspired by all the projects he encountered during his four years at William and Mary. Due to Mr. Generic_Name having plenty of experience with higher education projects, it allowed him to design a well developed summer project for my peers and I. I can only imagine the toddler like projects that would have been produced if my peers and I were allowed to design our summer projects instead of Mr. Generic_Name.\n \n More than likely if a student is given the opportunity to do less work they are going to take that opportunity. Throughout my years of high schoolÂ I have seen this exact manner take place over and over. Students will take the easy way out by selecting courses that have a history of demanding very little from those enrolled. This same mannerism repeats itself once the student is enrolled in a course and it comes time to actually work. Just this past marking period my Math Analysis teacher, Mrs. Generic_Name, gave us a take home test for winter break. This test consisted of 47 problems. The more problems you did the higher grade you got, but students did not seem to take advantage of this. More than half of my class chose to only do 30 of the 47 problems. This was because completing 30 of the 47 problems earned the minimum for a passing grade, a 70 percent. My peers had full control of their grades and chose to only work for the minimum passing score so that the rest of their winter break would be free of math. This is what will occur if a student is allowed to design their own summer project. Once a student realizes that they get to design their project they will make it something simple, lousy, and childlike. The student will design something just good enough too pass, so that they can return to their more practical summer.\n \n Some argue that a student would be more inclined to do their project if they got to design it. However, this is not true as someone's interest in something does not determine whether they will do it or not, but their work ethic is the true determining factor. Summer projects serve a meaningfulÂ purpose; to make sure kids maintain learning and strengthening their brains even when school is out. Something with a strong purpose like that should not be taken lightly and should be handled by someone who can produce the best project. This is why summer projects should be teacher-designed, so that students can take away as much information as possible when the project is all said and done.",

    Essay: "People go to school not only because they have to, but because a school's job is to advance students knowledge to set up kids and teens for their future goals. A teacher's job in the workplace is to give students knowledge on things they must know and help them with their next step in life. Their next step could be; college, applying for a job, help writing a resume, applying for a college, looking for a major, etc. After a long 9 months of school, some schools require students to complete a summer project to assure learning over the break. If students are required to complete a summer project, it must be student-designed because it introduces themselves, helps students discover their interest, and develops creativity.\n \n Summer projects should be student-designed to introduce themselves to their teachers the following school year. Martin Luther King Jr. created a \" I had a dream...\"\n \n speech that explained his struggle with racism and segregation. M.L.K. Jr. wrote and executed the speech in front of a live audience on his own, later making him the leader of the civil rights movement. The speech gave him a name worldwide, everyone knew \"Martin Luther King Jr.\"\n \n During the holocaust time period, a young Jew, Ann Frank kept a diary for people of the future so they knew what happened to all the Jews who were killed by the Germans. Her diary is now a famous book and in the Holocaust Museum in D.C. Ann Frank's diary was written herself, before that she was just one of many Jews, but because of her words, everyone know's who she is. A student-designed project would set up a teacher idea for how much their students knowÂ and help them to learn about their students.\n \n Students developing a project on their own develops creativity. Albert Einstein is known as one of the smartest people in the world. He created a robot, Frankenstein. Einstein blocked out others, used his own knowledge, got creative, and made history on his own. Helen Keller was born with the default of not being able to hear or to see. This was a tragedy, making it hard for Keller to walk and successfully know where she was going. Growing up with this issue she became extremely smart and used her problem, got creative, and began helping others by tutoring people who are deaf and blind. If students created their own projects it would give them an opportunity to come up with something incredible using what they, causing them to be creative, and generate ideas\n \n Students are in school receiving teacher-designed projects all year. On a students summer break, they should at least be able to create a project that interest them. Many young kids, between 3-7, try many different sports like; soccer, basketball, dance, gymnastics, baseball, cheer leading, flag football, etc. parents enroll their kids in different things so they can discover their interest young and stick to what does interest them to improve.Â Many high schools have electives to chose from as an extra class for students to find their interest. If teachers picked the elective classes for the students there is a good chance the student would not enjoy the class, destroying the point of an elective. By letting students branch out and selecting things that they enjoy could create an amazing project.\n \n Students wait all year for their three month summer break. Most schools dont require a summer project, however, some schools do. Over break there should be no project but if required give students the opportunity to design their own. This could not only benefit the students, but the teachers as well. A student-designed project would introduce students to their teachers, giving the teachers an idea of what the student does and does not know. It would cause students to brainstorm and come up with creative projects and help student's to find what interest them. A student-designed summer project would be effective for students as well as teachers.Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â",

    Essay: "Some schools instead of letting students have a break during the summer, instead make the students complete summer projects. Why schools do this is for the students to continue thinking and learning during the break. Most schools have the teachers design these projects, but the real way they should do it is by having students design them. The reason it should be this way is because it will encourage students to think for themselves, will let students learn and practice a topic they are interested in, and for the fact that a student can learn in a way helpful to them.\n \n Independent thinking is a virtue that every single person should have. But sadly independent thinking is not something students get to practice very often. But summer projects that students get to design themselves is a perfect way for students to build and improve this skill greatly. Rather than the student half heartily completing a project that a teacher designed, the student would instead think up and complete a project themselves and will learn a great deal in the process. For example when I was in Tenth grade my history teacher had my class complete a project based on World War One, and those where the only instructions. If it had been a simple project where we each had to make a poster board for an event during the war. Instead each person in my class designed a project entirely their own. One person did a poster on trench warfare, another person came up with a song about how the war was started. I came up with a game that showed how hard it was to prevent the war. This project encouraged each person in that class to think for themselves and we were all better for it.\n \n Having to complete a project about a boring topic can be brutal. One reason is that when people are not interested in something they can have a hard time doing it. A student designed summer project could be a perfect solution for this. The reason being is that instead of a student struggle to complete a project they don't care about, the student can and learn and practice a topic they are passionate about. For instance one time in my Filmmaking Class I got to complete an independent project on anything I wanted. My project was a film about cars, and for my entire life I have always loved cars and car movies. In doing this project I finally got to make my own car movie and in doing so I learned about a great deal about cars and film makingÂ it self. From how to make cars interesting to a viewer to how to film inside of one. This was an opportunity I was incredibly thankful for and will help me in my future of film making\n \n One could say that if a student is given too much free reign on a project during the summer they will not complete the project or will make a half baked one. This is not true as all people and all students learn differently and require different needs and when given the time and resources will make something great. For example for me they best way to learn is by doing it through something I am passionate about. Like I love to bake and in my eighthÂ grade civics class I got to make a cake about Presidential elections and because of they way I got to learn about it I still remember it to this day. This could be possible for every student if the project was more fitted for the students needs because that F average student could really be just struggling to learn and not out of laziness not completing the project but out of confusion or shame. As well as these projects would be during the summer the student would have even more time to practice and learn.\n \n Summer projects that students themselves are a great way for students to learn. From promoting independent thinking, to having the student learn about a topic they are interested in, and the student getting to learn in a way helpful to them. These could really help students in getting ready for a new school year and the rest of their lives as these are skills not easily forgotten.\n \n That is why schools should let student design their summer projects themselves.Â Â Â",

    Essay: "A lotÂ of people argue that in school, the teachers know best and not the students. This has led many people to believe that summer school projects should be teacher-designed and not student-designed. Summer school projects should be student-designed because teaching methods evolve with each generation and it gives the student more confidence.\n \n An efficient teaching system would change the way it teaches in response to newer and smarter generations. For example, when computers were becoming common in the 80's and 90's, many schools adapted to using them to better teach their students. This made teaching much faster for both the teachers and the students. Because the students back then demanded change, almost every school in America now has computers in it.\n \n Students would be much more confident if they knew the assignment was designed by another student. One example is the SOL's tests in the state of Virginia. Many students would find it more convenient if the questions on the test were more modern or relatableÂ and made by someone closer to their age. Applying this to every test would significantly boost student performance. Also, there is a popular saying that goes, \"Great minds think alike.\" Students minds are more sharp than most teachers minds, therefore resulting in a more efficient assignment design system. Furthermore, this leaves the students with less stress, easing the massive load of pressure that modern schools apply on them.\n \n From a constant wave of smarter, brighter generations of students to just simple confidence; this is why summer school assignments should be student-designedÂ and not teacher-designed. If we stick with old methods, no one will succeed into the future. Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â",

    Essay: "Have you ever had to do a project over the summer for school. Well some schools have it as a requirement to do a project over the summer break. The project that is assigned by the school should be teacher designed. This is because when the students comeback to school there teachers design the projects that are given. Teachers know the specifc steps the students need to use to make sure they have the right information they need to get a good grade, and what information they are required to have on their projects. Also the teacher can design it around something the students do on a daily bases on summer break.\n \n First reason the teachers should design it because they design all the projects when the students comeback to school from summer break. I say this because the teachers are always making the plans, and creating the way the projects are done. This is shown when they give you a project they create those plans and requirements. It also shows where you can find the information about the subject that the project is on. The biggest thing about the teachers designing the project is that it is involved in what you are learning in the class that you have the project in.\n \n The second reason on why the teachers should design the projects is they know what information the students need to have on their projects. Also what specifc ways they can get the information without violating the rules of the projects. This is because students have access to all type information through the internet and other sources, but some sources are not correct. Websites on the internet are a prime example of getting false information, which could lead to getting a horrible grade on the project that is assigned. Also the teachers know the websites that are vaild because they go in and look through them carefully.\n \n Finally the teachers can design the project around something the students do everyday on summer break. This is because they know studnets on summer break are not going to do reading or writing a paper. So they just make it something easy like recored the weather for a two whole weeks. They also could make you track how long you sleep a day for a whole week.\n \n That is why teachers should design the summer break project. It is because they are going to have to make the projects when the sutudents comeback.Â",

    Essay: "Teachers has given students an option for summer school, either they design their own project or the teacher design it for them..Students should be allowed to design their own summer project because they will understand it more, get it done right, and you will take your time on it.\n \n If students design there own project for the summer then they will understand it more. I say that because you go to summer school to get help that you couldn't get during school. So of courseÂ you will want a teacher to design a project for you to do. But if you find a project to do yourself you will see its much less complicated than the teachers. Plus you want have to listen to the teacher orders because its your own design.\n \n Another reason why is you will get it done right. If you designing your own project you shouldn't mess it up, it should be perfect. You have to trust in your self that you can do it right. I made a project on cars once I got a A+ on it becauseÂ I designed it myself so everything was perfect. Everything you do is not going to be perfect but when its your piece of work it should be close to A1.\n \n Lastly if you design your own summer project you will take your time on it. Lets be honest, most time when a teacher gives you a assignment that you don't like you will rush through it. If you are designing your own assignment then you will learn to take your time because you would want perfection to come from your own work. For example you won't have to worry about rushing on your research, finding your resources, and even decorating it. Everything is on your own time.\n \n In conclusion students should design there own summer projects to make it easier on themselves. They won't have to rush, it will be more understanding, and it should be a perfect project. Teachers want you to do things their way but sometimes you have to do your own thing. So after you can enjoy your summer break.",

    Essay: "You don't attend school to instruct and educate yourself, you attend school to engage in subjects, activities, and to learn from unfamiliar and familiar experiences, provided to you by a well equip and trained instructor. Teachers are their to provided assignments that are challenging, engaging, and purposeful in helping you to advance and progress further in your academics. For the past two summers of high school, I have completed three Advance Placement assignments; overall, they've provided me with some structure and understanding of what i'll be learning throughout my courses, despite the long hours and reading that was sometimes boring. Although students have a greater understanding on what issues or topics will be interesting to engage in over the summer, teachers are experienced enough to know what topics would provided useful information. Summer projects shouldÂ be teacher-designed, because, teachers are trained, experienced, and disciplined about what topics would be best for their students.\n \n To become a teacher, you must attend multiple years of college and to learn and retain rigorous information that will advance them in their field of study. With this training, a teacher can formulateÂ a project that would provide: guidelines, broad or narrow overview of the course,meaningful and useful information about the course; therefore, it is imperative that a well trained individual such as a teacher, to design summer projects for students. A teacher will apply their knowledge of the course they have obtained and, assignÂ challenging and well suited subjects for their students to engage in over the summer. All of these factors contribute to a meaningful and effective summer project.\n \n \"The older you get, the wiser you are\", a popular quote that depicts one of life's greatest principles, experience. Simply, a student has less experience than a teacher in a course, solely because, the teacher has learned much further in depth through higher education. Teachers have completed numerous assignments, projects, and activities to know what will bring a greater understanding from their summer project. It is important for students to be protected from mistakes and failed attempts that happened to instructors in the past, hence, teachers should design summer projects.\n \n Although students are creative and strive to do their best, sometimes, they focus and complain about the difficulty and objective of the assignment rather than, facing challenging and rigorous assignments that are needed to comprehend the course. Overall, students lack the discipline needed to self instruct the best fitted assignments that will help grasp an understanding on the course work. Moreover, it is a summer project and many students would not design a project that will be time consuming and challenging; in fact, they will design a fast going project or something inefficient to the overall goal . Therefore, teachers are to be the enforcer and designer of the summer projects for students.\n \n Even though it would be fun and creative for students to have a part in designing their own summer projects, students must acknowledge their deficiency in areas needed to provided a well suited project. Teachers are the best and most fit for the task of designing summer projects due to numerous factors stated in the previous paragraphs. Students may know what they like, however, they lack the discipline, experience, and training to self instruct their summer assignments. Overall, Teachers are not obsolete to the learning process for students over the summer, they provide the structure and the enforcement that students need. Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â",

    Essay: "Summer projects should be teacher designed. And for a multitude of reasons. But a couple of these reasons are Student designed projects wouldn't be challenging at all because they'd make them for their own conveinience if they'd even design one, and also the teachers know what is going to be taught in the future for the class so they can accurately design the project to cater to that, and the students can't.\n \n I'm a student and I know if I was ever given the opportunity to design my own summer project I'd try to make it as easy possible, and I know many of my fellow classmates would try to do the same. It's just how teenagers think matter of fact it's how most people think. If you can design your own work for yourself why make it harder for yourself that's just simple logic. In class students often say things like \" If I was in charge there'd be no school\" or \" If I could make the test I would make evry question 1 + 1\". Comments like these that I hear everyday in class are exactly why students can't be responsible for making they're own assignments, because they won't learn. Some of my friends are always looking for the easy way out of things and I presume that their are other kids out there like them so them designing their own work wouldn't work. I feel that kids should think this way simply becaus we're kids and this is how our brain works. This is a very important reason for why kids can't can't design summer projects it wouldn't make tham any smarter because they'd be designing the projects to their own convenience.\n \n Teachers know what they are going to teach in that year the lesson plan for the entire year is provided to them by the state. The student's do not, they're there to learn and to learn only. So the idea that the students would design a project is absolutely ludacris! Why would they do what their parents pay the teachers to do through tax money? If the students made the projects the projects wouldn't help them at all because they'd have no idea what they'd be learning and the idea that they'd know what their learning because they're in that class gets thrown out the window because its a summer project, only the teacher knows what's taught in that upcoming year. I think students should focus on learning and teachers should focus on teaching their shouldn't be any sort of role reversal because that just complicates things. Also teachers are their to teach the students it clearly states that in their job description. Having students design their own work just clearly sets them up to fail because they don't have the knowledge to know what knowledge they need to gain in order to be succesful.\n \n On the other hand I can see how people could have an argument for why kids designing their own summer projects could be a good thing. Students know what goes on in their minds and what certain work they need to address specific issues. Essentially they know themselves better than teachers do, and them designing their own project could cater to their specific needs and problems. Also a few of my friends have told me that when their teacher lets them design their own projects and assignments they feel like they know and understand the material better. In addition studets designing their own projects could mean less backlash for the schools incase parents get mad about summer projects being too hard, because the students in that school designed that project not the teachers.\n \n In conclusion students should not design their own projects because if it were left up to them they wouldn't learn anything and the project wouldn't be serious, and students don't know what is being taught in the class so they don't have the capacity to create their own work. This shouldn't even be a real question because it's very obvious that students shouldn't be designing their own projects they are there to learn from the professional which is the teacher not try and be the professionals themselves.",

    Essay: "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? I think it should be teacher-designed because they came up with this idea so, they should have some designs thought of another reason why i think it should be teacher designed is that teachers have more experince of doing projects then students so, they should have alot of examples of projects for students to do and the last reason is students are on summer break if the students have to think of design to do they probably will forget or not do it but if a teacher gives them the design of the project to do they will do it quick and then enjoy there summer break.\n \n Firstly, the teachers came up with this idea of giving students a summer project so, they can contine learning durning their break they should have some designs for the students for their projects. For example, my brother and I work at kroger and when we are off work our job still want us to be good citizens so they sign us up to feed the homeless and bring clothes to the shelters. Our job want my brother and i be good citizens at all times so, they gives us examples how to show them that we are good citizens.\n \n Secondly, teachers have more experince then students at projects so, they should have designs thought of for students. For example, my father was a boyscout member for 5 years and he know how to make different types of toy cars so, i had a project at school i had to design a toy car and my dad had experince at toy cars so he gave me alot of designs to do and i did the easiest one. People who have experince can help the other person who doesn't have no experinceat at all.\n \n Lastly, it is summer break students don't think about school if the students have to think of a design to do they will not do it but if the teacher give them a design for the project the students will do it quick for they can enjoy there sumer break. For example, Im a student at Generic_School if we had to design a project on summer break and i had to come with a design it would not have been done because we on summer break i don't think about school but if a teacher gives me a design i will to do it on first day of summer so, i don't have worry about the project trust me alot of students think a like so they will do the same some students don't even do home work and you think they will do a summer project.\n \n The teacher should design the project because they came up with idea so,they should have some designs, they have more experince then students at projects so they should have alot of designs to share, students are on summer break if they have to come up with a design they will not do it. If we had to this at my school nobody will do it because we don't think about work whatever school does this is a bad school.",

    Essay: "As a high school student we have 185 days in our summer vacation. Though most of us do not have to worry about a summer project, a lot of schools do. This could mark the question of; what is the project about? Many schools have the teachers assign the project and others have the students determine the project. If I had a project to do over summer break I would prefer it to be made up by me.\n \n We understand that teachers and schools want us to keep learning over summer, but a lot of the times many people go out of the country, visit family, do not have internet access, and etc. So, if students had the ability to choose their own project, they could do it based off what they have available over the summer. We all have to take our course classes in school, where we already do lots of learning on those specific subjects. So why not for a change, change it up. Give students the chance to choose their own topic. Maybe something they do not have a class for at school or something that really interests them.\n \n Student-designed projects would give students more of a broad area to find an idea. If a teacher were to design the project, most student'sÂ projects would all be the same. Having the students create their projects will give a wider variety of projects and topics. If having to present, other students could find out an interest they never knew they had. For example: I have been learning about the wars since around 6th grade, so if that was what my project would be on, I would be very bored writing about it because, it is something that I have talked about for almost six years. But if I was given the opportunity to write about something I want to write about, I would choose forensics, because we do not have a class about it at school but it is something that I am highly interested in and want to know more about.\n \n Statistics from Harvard University in 2019 say, \"93% of students have gotten better grades on self-made projects rather than ones handed by teachers.\" More students believe that when they are given the choice to choose a topic and make a project based off what they like and what they prefer, they receive a higher score. Self-designed projects give the students a chance to explore their interests and create something that is meaningful and custom made by them. No one wants to do the same project as everyone else, it is time to be unique! We do lots of projects throughout the school year that everyone else in the class does, so why not have summer be the one time we create something special to us.\n \n So tell me what is your project going to be about if you had that chance? Take this chance to be creative, find something that really sparks your interest, or whatever is available to you. Studies even showed you will do better when your project is self-designed. You have 185 days in your summer vacation then school comes around just to end it. Find a good way to spend it, do your project but enjoy it.Â",

    Essay: "Summer break is usually a time for fun and a break from school. Things like partying, vacation, working, and sleep are what most students tend to do on their break. During that time they aren't learning any new material which could cause a lot of problems going into the future. Some schools have started to give students summer projects that will help the students keep learning while on break. I believe those projects should be teacher-designed projects. Having the oppurnity to learn the same way you learn inside school without actually being in school, it gives students guidance and details about what should be done, which makes it easier for students, and would make it easier for the teachers to grade.\n \n Since I was in middle school I have been told that I had summer reading projects to do over my summer break. Summer reading is a teacher-designed project in which I choose a book off of a list, read it, and write an essay on so that they when I go back to school it could be graded by my teacher. Ever since Middle School students would do those projects so they wouldn't have a bad grade when they get back to school. They knew the summer reading project would get brought up and they wouldn't want to start of the new school year wrong. Summer reading helps students in English over the summer because they're reading a whole book and writing an essay on it after. That's basically the exactly same thing that we do in school! Teachers could guide the students through the emails and papers on how do to certain things meaning besides being face to face with the educator; your really just right back in class doing another project.\n \n Giving students something that outlines everything their supposed to do and how they're toldÂ to do it will make everything on everybody way easier. For some students it would be hard for them to come up with their own idea and for others it may not. Some students may already have something in their mind but other may not even know where to start. I meaning just making up a project out of thin air is going to be very hard considering we are still young and on summer break. Teacher- designed assignments could make would make it easier for students to know what they need to do all they way down to the detail which would make it easier for students to just do it like its normal. Having something laid out in front of you letting you know how to something will help the student stay focused on learning and help them get a good grade for the upcoming school year. While making them think about their on designed project could lead to stress and probably procrastination. They would have to think about all of their own little details notÂ knowing exactly what their supposed to be aiming for or compare it to. Thats very difficult for a student to do while trying to balance having fun on summer vacation, and more time than none of the time they'll just forget the project and go have fun. Now some people may say that students should learn responsibility, that they should focused on the job at hand and if they don't then they have to face the consequence. But knowing that i've already spent months in schools and i've picked up their traits along the way I am not trying to have to force myself to do anything in the time that I am free from school. Thinking that they've done work all year giving by a teacher in the time they have to do the work why stop now at a time when we don't even have school.\n \n Teachers now-days make most of their worksheets that they give out to the students. If they didn't make it personally then they got it from a website. Here's the thing though teachers make assignment that they know how to complete themselves and that they know how to grade. Having teacher-designed projects makes it some much easier on the teachers. They know how to grade the work, also they know what they are looking for. They aren't just making up random points to make up for certain people based on the type of project they did. They would have a structured organizer to go off of. Making it easier for students to just go with whats being told and easier for the teacher that just has a certain way of grading that can work for all students. Meaning no student can say that was done wrong because the way they were graded. All the students will be graded on the same things making everything clear and straight to the point. Just like it is during the school and which makes the grading promise for worksheet go so smooth.\n \n Having teachers designed projects for students during their summer will all around make things simple for everyone. Teachers can easily continue to do what they've been doing and students can get what they need to pass. Making time for students to still have fun while they are on break while keeping them educated. They are meaning reasons to why teacher desinged is the smartter choice and many reason why its may not be even though I don't think so.Â  Â Â  Â Â  Â Â",

Some state that teachers should design the project because they have more experience and better planning, but this is false. Although some may disagree, students should design their own projects over the summer.\n \n There are many reasons why this decisions should be made. Students manage their time in the summer differently making the designing process easier. They can use information they've learned previously in the school year when designing the project, helping the students gain time management skills.

    Essay: "A big issue in the school system is the question as to how to keep students working their brains over summer break. Many students find themselves or their peers to be stuggling with their work when they return to school in the Fall. A great number of schools have found success in assigning projects for each student to complete throughtout their break to ensure children to excercise their brains. The debate over summer projects is whether the assignment would be more beneficial if it were designed by teachers or the students themselves. Summer projects should be student-designed in order to provide oppertunities for creativity and independent studies, contibuting to important life skills.\n \n Allowing students to design a project specific to their interests encourages the student to express a creative process. The initial task of choosing a project requires the student to get creative with their resources based on what they find interesting. This process is critial to forming skills such as decision making and reasoning. Creating the project itself provides multiple levels of creativity and self expression for the student. Without a general project outline, the student will have to come up with ideas completely personal and relevant to themself. With the wide variation of projects produced from peer to peer, little input from other students will affect each others work. Enabling the students to set focus on topics and presentations personal to themselves sets the class up fo success by introducing crutial skills of creativity and hardwork.\n \n Student-designed projects will put students in a position to work and study independently, providing skills for future education and career paths. Many projects in the workplace consist of due dates in the future, leaving the employee responsible for time management and execution of the project. It is the responsibility of the employee or student to choose a project reasonable for time provided and work required. Projects that are student-designed will help form these skills so students can maximize them later in their careers. A student-designed project will allow students to work and study independently, leaving them solely responsible for their research and production of their project. Learning at a younger age to be acountable for their assignments will benefit the work ethic of the students in the future. While it may be a concern that students would choose a project too simple for their skill level or without much hark work behind it, a set of standards from a rubric could guide the students in the right direction to complete a challenging project on their own and gain important life skills through it.\n \n Assigning students student-designed projects will benefit students by encouraging hard work, creativity, and life skills. It is important to give students the option for independent and self designed work to push students to use their skills and succeed in future oppertunities of education and career paths.Â",

Though, to continue student learning, some schools require summer assignments to be completed by the end of that break. The question is, should teachers design those assignments, or should students? Summer assignments should be designed by teachers because they more thoroughly understand the information that will be taught next year and, between them and the students, teachers have the most experience in organizing and preparing assignments.\n \n Summer assignments should be designed by teachers because they have the best understanding of what is to come next year, so they know what to prepare the students for. You would feel completely lost and unprepared if the information you studied during the summer was wrong, or if you didn't have any information at all. Good teachers also collaborate well with others so they'll know what to expect for the future, also supporting summer assignments should be created by teachers.\n \n Teachers should design summer assignments because they have the most experience in organizing, preparing, and selecting assignments. Teaching is their job, so they understand the limits their of students, sometimes better than the students themselves. They grade their tests, homework, classwork, extra credit etc. and they answer questions, give advice, and help out even when they weren't asked to. They also can figure out which assignments go to which students, because they know that everyone is on a different academic level and should be given a fair chance at completing the assignment.\n \n Some say that teachers may have more experience, but the students are the ones that will need to complete these assignments with a most-likely full schedule during the summer, and they know their strengths and weaknesses far better than the teachers, so they should be the ones designing the assignments. Well, teachers also go on summer break so they understand the busy schedules and the need for vacation time as well as students. Also, as a huge portion of their job is to be in a classroom full of students, teachers may be able to understand a student's strengths and weaknesses fairly quickly and understand how to explain something to them. That's why certified adults should be the ones to handle summer assignments, not kids who are in school because they haven't learned all the necessary information that teachers already know.",

If they had the freedom to plan out their science fair, they would be in control; which would allow them be able to plan about what each person could present at the science fair or even when the science fair will take place. In turn, it could allow students to be creative and enjoy themselves. Allowing students to design their own projects give students the freedom to decide for themselves.\n \n While allowing students to design their own projects give students the freedom to express their creativity, it also shows that they are responsible. When they design their own projects, they show that they are able to make responsible decisions. For example, the students that wanted their project to be a science fair might have to consider where the science fair will take place and what type of concessions will be there. These are the decisions that the students will think about when they plan there science fair, and will result in proving their critical thinking skills and responsible decision-making. When students have the ability to plan out their own projects, they can be responsible enough to make good and smart decisions.\n \n However, there are those who disagree and state that students should not plan their own projects because there would be too much responsibility for the students to handle; there would also be too much freedom and students can take a negative advantage or abuse that freedom. On the contrary, the students would not have too much responsibility due to there being a large body of students pitching in ideas. As a result, there would not be too much responsibility on only one student or a small section of students. Another reason why these statements are false is because with a large amount of freedom, student can be a lot more creative when designing projects.\n \n In conclusion, students who participate in summer projects, that is required by school, should be able to plan these projects themselves. Eventhough some may disagree, their statements are false. If more summer projects were designed by students instead of teachers, more students would enjoy and appreciate summer projects a lot more.Â",

    Essay: "Imagine. Summer is here, and the dreadful school year is finally over. You're prepared to grab your swimsuits and go to the beach and actually enjoy your time off from learning. However, your blissful period is interrupted with anguishing agony as you realize you were assigned a summer project to complete. We've all been there, mourning over the fact that we received one more assignment to do for school. We are reluctant to start the projects as they seem pointless and a form of busywork for us; however, summer projects are designed to assure continuous learning through engaging tasks. Although teacher-designed projects can be seen as desirable, summer projects should be student-designed as it helps foster creativity and self-reliance.\n \n One reason why summer projects should be student-designed is the fact that it fosters creativity. Giving students the freedom to learn about topics that interests them far outweighs the notion of just finishing an assignment. In my high school experience, I tend to remember projects that I was truly interested in, rather than the monotonous ones designed by teachers (that solely get work out of you). Projects are meant to be engaging, so that later down in life you can recall the learning experience. This difference proves that creative work fosters quality rather than quantity. Furthermore, a teacher-designed project inhibits a student's potential to express their creative mindset. By receiving a topic and a guideline on how one should complete a project, a student becomes mentally set on pursuing that one path, disregarding all other options. This mental block of creativity can be harmful to a growing teenager as the advancement of society is dependent on creative thinkers which student-designed projects help create.\n \n Another reason why summer projects should be student-designed is the fact that it engages students to be self-reliant. Given the freedom to pursue one's take on a subject, helps foster self-confidence. In my high schoolÂ experience, doing a personal research that was interesting really helped create a sense of pride and accomplishment. Being confident leads to trusting one's ability rather than relying on others;and in our competitive society for careers, self-reliance is extremely important. Furthermore, allowing students to pursue their own designs lets them mature into adulthood. The apex of self reliance is adulthood and self learning is meant to teach and prepare students for their future. By removing the dependency of a teacher when doing a project, self support truly shines through, giving students hands on experienceÂ on the hallmark of adulthood. This is similar to the concept of parents not supporting a baby for too long so they can learn to walk on their own.\n \n In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed rather than teacher-designed as it fosters creativity and self-reliance. Given the freedom to pursue their own path, students not only learn more effectively but also become more unique. Letting students be unique allows for a desirable diverse community in which society becomes enriched by. Therefore, everyone should aim for topics that interest them when they are given the chance, as that is when humanity truly learns at its best.",

It gives them an opportunity to pick something they really love learning about and it helps the teacher get to know them better.\n \n They're most likely to put a lot more effort into the project. For example, you were just assigned a project and the topic on it was something you absolutely hated you're not going to want to do the project or put much effort in it and you're going to get bored with it.\n \n It's something positive for students to do during the summer. Kids are more likely to get into trouble whether it's because of boredom or they just like it them designing the project will give them something positive to do it'll keep them out of trouble and they'll have fun doing it. For example, one of the students i know likes to ride bikes everywhere even when he isn't allowed to and that gets him in a lot of trouble so one day i took him to the library and we read books and built action figures and he didn't get into any more trouble after that so sometimes all students need is something positive in their life and this project is just the thing they need.\n \n The students will always be learning.Â Them designing their own project is an amazing idea because it gives them the chance to be responsible and make desisons on their own.

    Essay: "For most students, summer is the best time for students to relax and release the stress that they endured during the torturous school year. However, some students are required to complete summer projects to make sure the knowledge that they have attained from those nine or ten months of school doesn't leak out of their brains. This is not a bad thing because it allows for teachers to know what they should focus on for the new year when these students come back. Summer projects should be designed by teachers because the summer projects will be graded by teachers, teachers already have the knowledge about the curriculum, and students will be too lazy to want to design a project for their summer.\n \n Summer projects should be designed by teachers because, in the end, teachers are going to be the ones grading it. Grading things, often, take a lot of time from teachers. However, the time it takes to grade could change by the subject that the teacher is grading.\n \n For example, a math teacher could take two or three days to grade all of their students' math tests. On the other hand, English teachers could take a week to a month to grade essays for all of their students. Projects take a long to do because the purpose is to see what the student knows overall and allow them learn things they didn't know before. Teachers are going to grade these projects at the beginning of the year, but they are also expected to begin teaching students new information of the course and grade other things assigned to put in the grade for first quarter. It would be stressful for the teacher if the students were able to design a project that would barely passed the minimum effort expected or if the students design a project that far and beyond. It would be a chaos for teachers to grade. Therefore, teachers should be able to design a project that they believe would allow them to efficiently grade at a faster pace.\n \n The people that should design the summer assignments are the people that know the subject of the summer projects the best and those people are teachers. It easy to say that designing a project is easy. However, it's difficult to find the resources and plan out a project that would effectively help new students learn the information they need for the new year. It will be difficult for new students to make a project on what they don't know. Teachers, on the other hand, know about the subject and the important things that students should focus on. They know websites, videos, movies, documents, or other resources that are helpful to students. For example, I had an AP United States summer project that I had to do in the summer of 2019. The teacher give us YouTube links to watch from and made us practice how to write different types of essays. The project wasn't boring. It taught people a lot of useful skills by allowing them to watch videos and reading sources. I learned a lot of things that I didn't know before. This example shows that teachers already have the information to make a good summer project that allows new students to learn effectively.\n \n Honestly, students are too lazy to want to design a project. If a student is too lazy to do a summer project, why would they want to make a summer project that will be source of their suffering and anxiety for the summer? For example, I had an English book that I was suppose to read in the summer of 2018. I did not even read a page in that chosen book. It was the easiest summer project ever and I was too lazy to even do that. Students want to have fun during their summer. They don't want to design a project for their summer. People could argue that designing a project is fun or if a student designed a summer project then they could make it be easy. However, the project will never be truly \"student-designed' because teachers and schools will have a requirement of what is suppose to be on the project that students will be designing. Also, summer projects are for new students. These new students know nothing to very little information about the new subject that they will be taking for the upcoming year. If teachers or the school expects students to do research on the subject to make their summer project. They might as well just make their own summer project because either way the student is gonna be force to learn something new. It will only be more work for the student to design a project for the summer that they will have little information about or they won't even be able to do it because they won't be in the class next year.\n \n In conclusion, teachers should be the ones designing summer projects because they know the most about the subject, they're going to grade these projects, and students are too lazy to design a project. People can argue that a student can still design a summer project and make it enjoyable, even with teachers' requirements. However, it would be so difficult for teachers and students because teachers will be forced to make requirements of what should be on the summer project and be forced to see if the summer project is effective. Students will be forced to make a summer project for new students and not for them because they're going to move to a different grade or subject the next year. Unless new students are making it. However if new students make it, they won't even know what are the important things that should be on the project or how to most effectively gather the information. It'll be too difficult, therefore teachers should just design the projects themselves.",

My last reason is that it enables that students to have a open mind, rather than being controlled or having to use someone else's ideas.\n \n The main reason why students should be able to design there own projects is so they can be creative. When students follow what a teacher wants they cant always be open minded. If students use there own ideas and make there own projects it allows for the student to be open minded and be more creative while doing the project. When using there own ideas it lets the students be more focused and have a more original idea. If all the students get told to do the same thing it makes the teacher have to grade the same project over and over. Rather than grading different projects that are more interesting and different.\n \n The second best reason students should make there own projects over the summer is so they have as much time to do them as needed. Usually in class the teachers set a date for the projects to be due by which leaves the students stressed. When they dont have a lot of time students tend to rush threw the project not being able to complete it all in the time given. Bu if the students use threw own ideas and make it threw outÂ the summer it makes the projects more entertaining for the student to make and lets them complete the project on there own time.\n \n My last reason students should make there own projects is so that they have fun with it. Most of the time when you have to follow a piece of paper given to you by the teacher it leave the students bored and has them repeat the same information over and over. Rather than them making there own projects an having fun while doing so. It leaves the field of ideas moreÂ open when you can go off the things you know rather than looking it up on Google and always having to listen to a teacher. When you let the student use the information they know it allows the student to the type of person they really are which lets the teacher know what interest them and motivates them to maybe switch things p in class while doing assignments like those.\n \n In conclusion I think that students should be allowed to make there own projects rather than having to listen toÂ a teacher or have to follow a form. My reasons being that it lets the student be more creative and have them be more interesting. I allows the student the have fun with it and makes it more interesting for the teacher to grade. Lastly it gives the student more time to complete the project when they do it own there own and enables them to finish it correctly and not be stressed out.

    Essay: "If some schools require students to do summer projects over their break, how can one insure that students will complete it if it were designed by a teacher? Students never want to do work over the summer, but if its a requirement it should at least be something that intrigues them. If the project is teacher-designed many students probably wouldnt like the assignment that the teacher assigns them over their break. which leads to a possibility of many students not doing the project at all. Students dont want to have a project that'll be confusing and time consuming to them. They would rather have something that can be productive and fun. A student-designed project allows for: students to be more interested in their project, to have a project designed by students will be more intriguing, and students can work together creatively to create something that'll help them to continue learning over the summer.\n \n Many students like doing things that interest them, it makes them enjoy what they're working on. If the summer project is student-designed. It will be something that they create, not something that a teacher made up and gave to their students to give them a hard time over break. It's indeed a way for them to learn but its not how a student would want to learn. Students want to learn during their break with something that doesn't bore them. They want something that can keep them entertained and want them to keep learning. overall a student learns better when they're fully committed to it and want to put their focus on, especially if its designed by them.\n \n Almost all teachers know that students enjoy working together, students are very creative and intelligent, thats why having them design a project like this strengthens the reasoning behind why these summer projects should be student-designed as compared to being teacher-designed. Does one really believe that students enjoy doing projects that are designed by a teacher, no, students enjoy doing things their way, something that can relate to them and understand a lot better. For example, a student would prefer working together with other students to create something fun for them to do over their time off, as opposed to being restricted to do work over summer by ones teacher, with boring ways of learning; therefore, leaving students demoralized. Students always perform well when on topic and working together, if a students can come up with something creative together. It'll make them feel comfortable with completing this summer project; furthermore, allowing them to continue learning through a unique, fun, and creative assignment.\n \n In conclusion, a student-designed project would: intrigue students, make them more interested in it, and it allows them to work together. Having students design a project for them to do over the summer would increase student productivity over their time off. Therefore enabling that student to continue learning and maintaining their intellect. Most teachers try to relate to students but they cant, having a teacher-designed project wouldnt be as a effective as having one designed by a student. The amount of creativity that a student has in ones mind is overwhelming. Students work best with others and together they can create enjoyable tasks for themselves. The probability of a student doing a student-designed project is much higher as compared to a teacher-designed project. Summer projects will be more enjoyable and interesting if it were designed by students instead of teachers.",

    Essay: "Student Summer Projects\n \n During the summer we all have receive some sort of project or assignment that would be due during the first week of school. However, the projects are always assigned by teachers on what they think that is best for us. Not all students are pleased with the fact that we have to do work during the break. Considering that they just went to school for almost ten months and still have teachers think about what the students should do during summer break it's not fair. In my opinion I think that teachers should let students choose their own summer projects because they can have fun while making the project, turn the project however they like into something creative and have them be motivated. Summer is the time to not stress about assignments that are complicated. Instead it should have the student be interesting to have something to do so they can remember the memories they made while making the project.\n \n Summer time is the time where students can be stress-free and just have fun with friends and family. Including the fun activities they enjoy doing. That should be the main idea of a summer project because letting students decide how they want to do their own projects will keep them motivated on doing it because they can express their creative minds onto something they know they won't get judged on. For example, Most people even without having to do a school project, majority of teenagers want to document their summer to show everybody what they did, to remember the amazing sunsets or sunrises throughout summer or the cool places they went too and family events that happened. As well with trying new thing that you didn't think you would enjoy but by the help of thee summer project you made , you learned a lot more about yourself. Either by the help of a friend or by just finding new activities that interested you by reading it or by seeing a commercial. Students want to share every detail of it because it was something they experienced during those two months that made them happy and not feel over whelmed with stress that was over their heads because of a boring assignment their previous teacher assigned them before school ended.\n \n In addition, while students are making the project they can work individually. Some may feel more motivated to think outside of the box on what your whole topic should be or how they can make it happen. However, with a group project you can work with friends make it even more adventurous. Some students may think differently instead of going out they can make an invention or make something from scratch, the possibilities are endless because it would be up to the student to create something unique that teachers may not have thought of before.\n \n When teachers design projects sometimes it isn't the type of projects that we all expect. You can't really be creative because majority of the time they will give you a template of the important things you should actually do and it just gets rid of the fun of doing the project because you're only doing what it is asking you to do. As well with having teachers design the project it wouldn't make much sense because you passed all your classes as well with the grade you just passed. During the summer you don't have any teachers that you're enrolled in yet in their class. That's the main reason why I think it shouldn't be up to the teachers to design and have the students instead .\n \n In conclusion, I strongly think that summer projects should be student-designed rather than having teachers designed the project because summer is the time where even if you're a teacher student, principle. It is your summer and your own experience. You should at least as a student have the control of what you're own summer project should be about during your summer break because it is where you mostly spend time with family and friends just enjoy everybody's time. Also it helps you think in many ways on how you can make your summer the best one yet by doing many activities or starting new hobbies just because of this project and learn yourself at most by just having fun. A project doesn't have to be boring, you just have to find what interests you and what helps you keep motivated.\n \n .Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â",

    Essay: "Many students tend to forget things they learned at school, in the summer. During summer, teenagers are out having fun and taking a break from school. Although the school year is over, students should not lose focus on what is important. Since teens need to keep focus, a summer project would be the perfect task for them. Summer projects should be designed by their up coming teacher because students will get familiarized with what they will learn, teachers will assign projects that will be beneficial to their students, and teachers will have a criteria showing students what to look for.\n \n To begin with, going into a new school year, no one really knows what the year will be like. Having a summer project allows students to have some knowledge on what the new year might bring. For example, if Generic_School made students do one summer project it would not only help their grade for the first quarter, but also show them know what they willÂ learn. Although there will be students who will not do the projects, there will also be people who will complete them because they are serious and focused on school. Students who work hard and want to be successfulÂ in life will see that summer projects given to them will be beneficial to them.\n \n Additionally, teachers know what is best for their students. A prime example here at Generic_School is a geometry teacher, although she assigns a handful of work, she knows that if the students completes it, it will be extremely helpful to them. Most of time students will complain about the amount of work a teacher might give them but in the long runÂ it will help them tremendously. Teachers giving out projects to do in the summer may sound dreadful but it will, undoubtedly help them. To add on teachers will always tell students what to look for and give them a rubric to help them.\n \n As a matter of fact, teachers will never assign a student a project and not give them a rubric. Often times, students will argue and pout about a project, but when a teacher gives their students a rubric and the criteria of the project, it makes it twice as much easier. Students who are serious about school and want to bring up their GPA will not complain about one measly summer project. Also, summer projects will never be too hard, since the school year has not yet started. Teachers will most likely tell their students what to do and how to do it. Even though the projects assigned to students may be easy, some may complain about the subject and want to do a project on a subject they choose.\n \n While some students may prefer to do a summer project on what they want. The pros to this would be that they are actually interested in the subject and more motivated about it. They would also, most likely get a better grade on something they are genuinelyÂ concerned about. For example, if a student loved the ocean, they would be more excited doing a project on marine life or how unique the ocean is than doing a project about different rocks. Although this may be true, teacher-designed projects would be more beneficial than a student choosing their own subject.\n \n To conclude, teacher-designed projects would be more productive for students than student-designed projects. It gives students the opportunity to learn a little before the school year starts. Teachers will assign students projects that will be helpful to them. Also, the projects would not be extremely hard because the teacher is essentially telling students how to complete the project. Schools should allow teachers to assign the students projects to do in the summer because it will help them a great deal more than students choosing their own projects.Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â",

    Essay: "A summer project is suppose to show teachers what you learned over the past 9 months in his/her classroom. that's why they invented the project and some students never do it which could hurt their grade at the start of the first nine weeks. Students should not be able to design this project because some students might make the project too easy and some students might just be lost and confused after the fact that they got help from a teacher.\n \n The first reason why students shouldn't be able to design this summer project is because students would just make the project about an easy subject like art or gym and it might not be so helpful to teachers. students like to sleep in class or be on their phones and most of them students are going to be the ones lost on how to do this project which is 50% of students in each classroom. If the students were allowed to design the summer project it would fail because student lack the skills needed to create the project they don't know what to make the project about and some of the students still wouldn't do the project because they feel as if they learned a lotÂ already during the school year. If you want students to design the summer project the teachers should give them rules to follow and a list of things that are inappropriate for school and not allowed to be on the project. many students would continue to struggle with school work if they design their own projects because its not helping them get better on that subject for school.\n \n Another reason why teachers should design the project is because they would help the students get better with the subjects they struggle on the most in school. teachers can design projects to help students get better with work in school and if students where to be in control of this project they would make the project about something off topic or something that is not about what they learned in school. the whole reason for this project is so that students can show the schools what they learned over the years and show them that they are still learning over the summer time and not just playing around. Im still a student and i want to graduate and summer is three months away if my teachers were to give me a project and tell me to design it i would make it about my favorite subject in school which is history but some students like to play around and skip class and school to hang out with friends so they don't learn anything and when it comes time to do the project they are confused and lost on how to do the project the point is if students don't want to do the school work in school what is going to make them do the summer project so some students are going to take a zero for the grade because they don't care about their grades or the school.\n \n The project should be about what students learned not a copy of their friends work. some students like to share thier work with others and it could get them both in trouble. the point is some students are going to cheat off each other so they can get a good grade on the project if they was to be in control of the design. teachers should give the students a list of things that are good for the project to be about because if they dont they are just going to be turning in some work that isnt about school work they learned or even school at all. Teachers need to be the ones to design this project just like all the other ones they made why would they switch it up all of a sudden now?.\n \n A summer project is suppose to tell teachers you learned a thing or two while sitting in their classroom how would the students who didnt pay attention during class do the project?. these are all reason why teachers should design the summer project and not the students.",

    Essay: "Over the summer, some schools require students to complete one summer project to keep their brains active and continue learning during the break. Teachers have the ability to assign their students what their project should be. However, it can be argued that students should be the ones that get to choose their topic for the summer project. Students should be able to pick their own summer project because they get to share what they are passionate about, have more control over the process, learn how to be self reliant.\n \n Students should be able to pick a topic based on their interests instead of a teacher assigned topic. Students will have a better attitude and work ethic if they can do a project that reflects and shares what they are passionate about. They will also show more dedication and time put into their projects because students will care to make sure the information is accurate and not misrepresented. Students will be more proud of the work and research they have accomplished for a project that they choose and find appealing instead of a topic from a teachers choosing.\n \n If students are given the ability to choose their own topic, they will have more control over their process and what they want to research. For example, students can start out with something as simple as a bottle rocket and decide what they want to do with it. They could do a project on fuel types or materials and have control over what they want to use or discover. This could also help students to easily restart a new project of they are have difficulty researching their current topic. In contrast, if students are having problems with teacher picked topics, they have to figure out how to do the project some other way and do not have the ability to switch. Allowing students to pick their topic is better so students have more control over their project.\n \n When students are required to pick their topic, they will not only learn how to take responsibility for their work,Â but will also learn how to meet a deadline by doing a little bit of work every day in order to receive a good grade. Students also will learn self reliance and work on their own if every student picks an individual topic. If teachers pick students topics, there is the possibility of students copying others work that may have the same topics. If students choose their own topics, they will learn to become self reliant by showing their own work and findings.\n \n The biggest downside to students picking their own topic is that teachers grading summer projects or presentation may not understand the work or topic from a project the student has dedicated the summer to. If teachers picked the topic for students to focus on, they would have prior knowledge of the topic and know that students can successfully complete the project from other students that might. But this could be avoided by having students submit their topic online over the summer so teachers know what they can do to be prepared. Students can then meet with three or four teachers, one of which could be someone with some prior knowledge of the topic, and students can go more in depth into their project. Teachers can ask questions making it more like a discussion that the student can lead instead of a student presenting to a class of their peers.\n \n If schools assign summer projects, students should be the ones who select their research topic so that they will be more excited and eager to share what they have learned, they will have more control over the management of their project, and they will learn to take responsibility for their work. Overall, students will take more pride in work they have done if they choose what they want to research.",

    Essay: "Summer projects are projects that teachers give to students so that they can continue to learn over the break. These projects can be later turn in for a grade that following school year. Certain schools require student to complete these for programs that students are in. Some students may have difficulties with these projects based on how they're designed while others have ease. Summer projects should be teacher-designed and not student-designed because of equal opportunities, it aids students to be prepared for their next school year, and its another way to assess growth.\n \n First, summer projects should be teacher-designed to ensure that students get equal opportunities. Having students designed their own projects limits equal opportunities to get a good grades. For example, one student may have difficulties designing their own project than another student.\n \n With projects being teacher-designed, teachers can help students with the guidelines of the projects. It also ensured that students get graded fairly. Since they are teacher-designed, teachers know what mistakes to look out for so that the students get they grades they deserve.\n \n Next, projects being teacher-designed aids students to be prepared for the next school year. If the students design their projects than they are not being prepared. They prepared the student for next year by challenging the student in the project. Projects foreshadow to the students what to expect the next school year. They don't only prepared to the students, they prepared the teachers also. By these projects being teacher-designed, other teachers can see what the student know and don't know and plan according to their scores. Being prepared for next year gets rid of anxiety for the teacher and for the student and makes it easier for both the student and teacher.\n \n Lastly, it's another way to assess growth. With teacher-designed projects, the projects would be similar to a post-test. They can judge if a student learn anything over the course of a school year. During the school year, teachers see all the mistakes and errors students make. By making these projects student-designed, there isn't a way to know if they student excelled or not. This also ties in helping teachers be prepared to go over the topics that students were struggling on so that they can finally pass that topic.\n \n equal opportunities, growth tracker and student aid are some reason why summer projects should be teacher-designed. in the end, student should able to have equal opportunities to achieve good scores. Teacher-designed projects aid in preparation for the school year. By making projects teacher-designed, teacher have another way to track growth. Schools should adopt this so that students can be comfortable and have ease in the future.",

    Essay: "Many students can argue the fact that we would want to have our summer available and free. Not loaded with all of these projects that future teachers will assign to us. But have you ever thought about the reason why teachers do this? It's to give insight and a general observation about how the class that you signed up for will be like. Teachers don't give these projects to ruin our summer. In fact, a lot of them would much rather have us enjoy our summer. However, students need intellect about the class that they should eventually be prepared for. 3 months is a lot of time to forget about the material that you previously learned. Which is why I believe that having summer projects that are teacher-designed would be more beneficial to the graduating students. Teacher-designed projects will prevent students from not learning properly, memory loss and provide teachers an insight about what to teach.\n \n To start off, every student would much agree to ban and/or make summer projects optional. Including myself. But we, as students, never realized the benefits and refreshments that these projects provide for us. If students were to somehow \"design\" these projects, students would obviously take the easy route instead of pushing themselves to become smarter and more vigilant of the criteria that will be taught. For example, various schools and counties require students to read some sort of book and log it over the summer. From experience, we would per say, completely forget about the assignment and log fake dates and pages just for the sake of \"doing it\". Through this path, the student did not learn and influence their reading abilities due to this method. Therefore, validating my thought process. On the other hand, when teachers give a specific book to read, students will most likely read the book or at least read upon a summary to have a little knowledge, knowing that the teacher would give out some kind of quiz or paper to complete. The purpose of requiring a specific book is to provide a reference about how the class will be like and the criteria that will be taught. Student-designed projects would not be reliable in this case.\n \n As a student, memory loss is very frequent in my case. I forget about a handful of material and subjects that have been taught. When given a vocabulary test, I tend to blank and forget about the words that I have studied because it wasn't taught to me over and over again. Memory loss can happen to anyone because it's unpreventable. This is another reason as to why summer projects are designed and assigned. It's to refresh our memory and remind us about the education that has been previously learned. If projects were to be student-designed, they would most likely have absolutely nothing to do with the future subjects. We have no knowledge about what a teacher is going to teach. In this case, wrong statements will be acquired and lead to misconceptions. Our memory would be refreshed with these non-true subjects creating a confused situation once the school year begins.\n \n Not only do teacher-designed projects give students support, but it also gives the teachers support. Teachers can prepare themselves for the upcoming year through summer projects. It can give them some expectation of what to teach. Eventually creating some circumstances that can be built off of. It gives the ability to expand the criteria into something more knowledgeable. For instance, a biology teacher can assign a project that can revolve around cells like eukaryotes and prokaryotes. This project could later on be broken down into units because the project was based on a very broad topic. Because students completed the teacher-designed project, they could possibly be more ready to accomplish learning requirements faster. The knowledge of these students would be broadened leading to an easier understandingÂ of the beginning units.\n \n Unfortunately, teacher-designed summer projects could create stress and anxiety. Summer is a time for children to enjoy no homework, tests and etc. Projects should not be given on a time where students can receive a break. Subsequently, required projects are not going to disappear. Student-designed projects could have less of an influence towards stress because it would most likely be easy to complete and have the possibility of incorporating fun activities. This would achieve the factor of less stress and anxiety of completing a project on time. Although these circumstances appeal greatly to students, teacher-designed projects would believably contain a more beneficial outcome. In the end, a project that has correct information will more likely have a positive outcome in the long run. In conclusion, educators creating these projects will bring upon a better learning experience for students. Teacher-designed projects will prevent students from not learning properly, memory loss and provide teachers an insight about what to teach.",

    Essay: "Summer projects, we all hate them but have to do them at some point. There is no getting around it, so why not design them better? Summer projects are becoming more and more common but a lot of students have concerns about their break being over loaded with work. Is it still considered a break when you have to do home work every night for a solid period of time? I think summer projects should be student designed so teachers do not assign too much work, Also its a good use of students time to design and complete a summer project.\n \n I think summer projects should be student designed so teachers do not assign too much work over break. If a project is made by students they will make it as simple as can be while also having all the requirements to still learn the information properly. There should not be anything wrong with having a project with the minimum amount of work needed to still learn the topic. Sometimes teachers create projects without realizing how much work must be done to complete the project. If the project was student created with teacher approval a lot of issues would be solved. Student designed projects that have been approved by a teacher will make the work load go down while the students learn the same information. This is all because the project was designed by someone with relatively the same amount of knowledge of the topic.\n \n In my opinion summer projects should be student designed because its a wise use of time to have students create and then later complete a project. Students will learn a lot when designing a project because they must know what the project is on. Creating a project will teach them the info needed to complete the project so they will learn the information and have it stick in their minds too. The students would be able to complete the work reletivley fast because of the fact that they designed the work themselves. I dont see a problem with getting work done faster do you? Having student designing projects for peers to complete a great use of time because students will learn while creating the project. They will also get the work done quicker since they created the assignment.\n \n An opponent of my view might say that a student created project would be made too easy for the class. A flaw that I can immediately point out in this argument is a teacher would have to approve the student made project before assigning it. A teacher would never approve of a project that didnt make the students actually work. While this opposing viewÂ makes sense there is a way to make sure the work load is appropriate. I think that teachers should have a strict set of guide lines for the project the students are designing.\n \n Summer assignments should be created by students in an effort to make sure students do not work too hard while on summer break. It's also a good use of time for students when they create their ow assignments. The time it takes to completeÂ the work will go down while the amount learned will grow. Summer vacation is a precious time and should not be spoiled by large and work heavy projects. more schools should consider student designed summer projects, its a smart idea. Â Â Â Â",

    Essay: "After nine months of endless assignments and fighting the desperate battle to balance academics and extracurriculars, summer break arrives for public schools around the country. Those three months spent relaxing in the sun can be a much needed escape for many, but they can also do a huge disservice, as the knowledge that was previously gathered slowly deteroriates with the sudden loss of daily learning. Schools across America have begun to hand out summer assignments for the classes that are to be taken that fall, and it has ultimately been a success. The question now is how these summer assignments should be created and then presented. I personally believe that these projects and worksheets should be student-designed and for the following reasons: students understand their own time restraints, they know what level of difficulty works for them, and they can see what is and isn't necessary to review.\n \n First is the management of time. The only people who understand what kinds of schedules students follow over the summer are students themselves. Many teachers seem to believe that the summer experienced by high schoolers is similar to those in Disney Channel movies; they wake up at noon and hang out with their friends every day until school starts back up again. The tough truth to accept is that summer has only gotten harder with the passing years. Many students pick up part time jobs to gain income, while others take on their own academic hurdles, such as Generic_School. It can be extraordinarily difficult to find time to lift your head above the flowing current of busywork, which makes it more important that students design these summer assignments. They know how much time to set aside for academic work, and they can think through an effective time management plan which would make assignments not too short and also not too long: moderation.\n \n The second point to examine is the level of difficulty. Students know what kind of work they can handle. From personal experience, it wasn't very fun to sit at the beach and attempt to complete the first page in a packet of AP Chemistry problems, but it was perfectly necessary and extremely helpful. The questions required knowledge from past teachings and a small amount of inference and research, and I completed the assignment in just a few hours. I had to read out of a textbook to understand new concepts, but the work itself was fairly simple. It's these kinds of summer assignments that students would be able to effectively compose, because they do in fact want a healthy challenge, just not an impossible feat. The difficulty levels should vaguely coincide with whatever class the work is preparing students for, without giving them the feeling that they are already back in school.\n \n The last point is knowing what's necessary and what isn't. For example, a long assignment for an optional music class seems rather unnecessary compared to simply suggesting practice over the summer. If students were required to have a lengthy project for every single class that they planned on taking the upcoming school year, summer wouldn't exactly be much different than every other month. Students don't need a complete break, but they also don't need three more months consisting of the same grueling and tasking work. I do think that AP classes should be handing out summer assignments. But academic courses? That's for the teachers to decide.\n \n In conclusion, students are smart enough to form their own summer assignments that follow the basic guidelines given by teachers. They know how to wisely create a project that doesn't absorb too much or too little time, isn't too easy or too hard, and is completely necessary for staying on track in school. Not every student would be willing to work on an idea for a project that would be assigned to each of their classmates, but every grade has several bright and accomplished achievers who would take up the challenge. Students know their own limits. We can set them for ourselves.",

    Essay: "Many schools require students to complete summer projects in order to keep them learning over the break. These projects are usually teacher-designed and are assigned to the students at the end of the year. Some students argue that these projects should be student-designed rather than teacher-designed since it is taking up their summer fun time, but many disagree. Summer projects should continue to be teacher-designed because students will receive a premade rubric, projects are likely to be more organized, and projects can still be based off the students liking.\n \n Some will argue that summer projects should be student-designed due to the fact that it is taking place during the students summer free time. Students want to be able to create the project themselves so then they can create it how they want to create it but that makes grading very difficult for teachers. Letting students design summer projects also has a high risk of unorganitzation because students may have the mentality that they can do whatever they want and still receive a good grade. If students do what their teachers tell them to do, then they will already know what to do from the beginning.\n \n Most teachers and parents would agree that a rubric should be given to the students for them to follow while completing projects. Rubrics allow students to have a guideline to follow while completing their projects, essentially making the projects easier. Rubrics also give students a checklist that helps them stay on track and makes sure they are getting everything done that they need to get done in order to get a good grade. If students created their own rubrics, that would make grading projects extremely difficult for the teachers and most students do not understand how hard it is to actually create a rubric. Therefor, rubrics should always be given out by the teachers.\n \n If summer projects continue to be teacher-designed, then students are more likely to be more organized with their project. Students will have gotten an explanation on how to complete their project and will have been informed in a way everyone understands on how to complete the project to the best of their abilities. Organization is key when completing projects and the best way to stay organized is to allow the teachers send students on the right track. Most students to not think about how easy it is to become unorganized and turn a great project into a ball of confusion. They need the teachers help to make sure they do the project right.\n \n Summer projects may be teacher-designed but that does not mean they can not be based off of the students opinions and liking. Students can still receive a rubric and be told what to do and still have a high level of creativity involved in their project. Before school comes to an end, teachers can ask the students what they want to do most. having that information allows teachers to create a project that is easy for them to grade and is still fun and enjoyable for the students who are doing the project. A big factor in school projects is making something that the students can be happy and proud of and not something that they forced themselves to finish and are unhappy with. In order to keep both teachers and students happy, summer projects should continue to be teacher-designed.\n \n Once summer starts, students become independent and are on their own with the project they are assigned with. That is why they should be given a guideline on how to complete their project, ways to stay organized, but they should still be able to complete their project with a smile on their faces. If summer projects stay teacher-based, then all three points can be addressed and improved upon. Students may believe that they can do everything by themselves but they will never succeed without a teachers help from the beginning.",

Teachers know what to put into the summer project and know that the students would use their knowledge to complete the assignment.\n \n Teachers have the ability to acquire the knowledge that they teach to their students and assign the projects to the students' understanding. I have done a summer project in middle school just so I would not forget my studies. Plus, to maintain their knowledge it would have been school related, in order to continue their learning process.

Knowing that they would, requiring them to complete a summer project is appropriate. From my experience, I know that in math they start to review a little of the course that I took last year to prepare me for the math that I would take this year.

Which is the reason on having the teachers to create the project base on the subjects that they learned throughout the course.\n \n Although having to work on a project over summer can be a positive outcome, there are negative outcome with it.

Keeping up with the students' education is important to boast their confidence to the next subject. The students would understand the requirement of their project if the teacher created the project instead of the students.

    Essay: "There are lots of pros and cons when discussing teacher designed summer projects or student designed summer projects.\n \n Some pros of teacher based summer projects would be, there's help whenever its needed, more motive to work harder since the teacher is pushing you.\n \n On the other hand, the cons would be simply paying the teacher a lot of money to work with the student.\n \n One could argue that the teacher would be willing to do it for free, however that is economically irrational we have to assume everyone is rational.\n \n Although having a teacher based summer project would be very assisting to the students, the socially optimal route would be the student based summer project.\n \n In today's society, there's lots of \"hand holding\" with students and they arent able to adjust to the real world lifestyle as easily as they could be.\n \n Forcing students in the habit of being independent is beneficial because when these students have to go to college and get a real job later in life, they'll be familiar with the situation and they'll know how it feels so that way the amount of stress put on them is minimized.\n \n Kids working student based will also help them not rely on getting help from a teacher all the time and they'll be able to learn material in class with less assistance.\n \n These students will exit the project with more applicable skills that they will carry on for the rest of their lives.\n \n In the aspect of economics, hypothetically if the program is teacher based, then these teachers will need to be compensated for their tutoring.\n \n For every single student to have a teacher beside them would be a lot of money spent by the school.\n \n The argument could be made that the teacher would do it for free, however that is unlikely since they're on summer vacation.\n \n In the long run, the alternative of having the kids do these problems by themselves without teachers is the best route for them to develop in dependencyÂ and have the school save some money.\n \n Detoxing and having time off is important for teachers too, not just students.\n \n In the event that a student gets stuck on a question and doesnt know how to solve it, there are solutions.\n \n The student can ask his/her parent to help them or, the teachers that are on summer vacation can make videos of how to solve the problems that are assigned on the project.\n \n If one teacher makes one video that explains everything, then that saves everyone the time and money.\n \n instead of every teacher being assigned to a student and have them work it out, one teacher can make a video that helps all without them even being there!\n \n In conclusion, the student based project would be most beneficial to society in the aspect of economics and independence of the students.\n \n While the students persevere and develop skills of independence, the teachers can enjoy their summer break free of distractions.\n \n The summer assignments all students across America must complete are merely assignments to keep us ready for the school year, therefore teachers dont need to be involved in assignments that arent meant for students to accelÂ in.\n \n The students will return to the classroom far better off with the student based project as opposed to the teacher based project.

    Essay: "The final bell rings as students come flying out the school doors pushing and shoving each other to be the first one on their bus, school is out and the halls are left empty, just when people start to relax at home they remember about the summer project that has to be finished by the time school is back in session. school projects can be a pain, but they do serve a purpose. Teachers require students to complete this summer project to assureÂ they dont loose the knowledge they learned throughout the year and to also assure they continue to learn throughout their break. Summer projects should be student-designed because it gives the student freedom, shows the knowledge of the student, and lets the project vary from student to student.\n \n Summer projects can give students the freedom to do whatever they see fit and show how they can be creative. Students like to have freedom and will put more effort into something where they can choose what to do rather than have the same project assigned to everyone where creativeness is not a product. Students have to complete the work assigned to them in school which is already lacking creativity, teachers should give the students freedom in this summer project and have the student leave the school with a positive outlook. Every day student complain about the lack of freedom school already has, leaving them to be tempted by the things they cannot have.\n \n Schools want to know that the students are keeping their minds fresh with knowledge and over the summer they give them a project to be completed by the time they come back. Having these projects be student-designed can not only be creative but also show what the student knows and remembers. Students can present what they know and how much they continued to learn by the projects they choose to do. The summer projects can also tell a teacher what topic they need to work more on with the students, and is very helpful in doing so.\n \n Students can choose what they want to show and how they want to show it, whether if it is an essay, interview, or a project that have to build, with the ideas being limitless one students project cannot be the same as another, with each project having a unique difference. students can fallow their own rules and go the places their mind takes them. With the projects being different and varying,coming in all shapes and forms, the student can choose what they want to do and what they are be able to do. With the projects being different it can be easier to tell if a student copied anotherÂ students work, where as if all the projects were kept the same it can not be easy to tell if someone copied another work.\n \n Some teacher may argue and say that a teacher-designed project may be better, but a student-designed project can outbalance the good in a teacher-designed project. Rather that telling us what we need to Know students should be able to show just how much they actually know, some student can look up the information then forgetÂ about it because it is something that they are being graded for and have to include it inÂ the project to get the best grade they can achieve. This also helps prepare the student for next year by showing them what they need to work more on and better themselves so the can enter the next year without any problems.\n \n In conclusion schools and teachers should let students design their own summer projects because it gives more freedom to the student, gives teachers a sense of the students knowledge, and gives the project variation. The final bell rings as all the students are let out, but one thing remains hanging over their shoulders, a summer project. Â",

    Essay: "Statistics show that when teachers help students one on one they are more likely to recieve better standards on school work then when teachers do not work with students. Many people believe that summer projects are un-necessary because students work all school year and now it's their summer break. Although, in reality, summer projects help keep students in a working mindset and helps them stay dedicated to school. Summer projects should be designed by the teachers themselves because this gives the students insight on the teacher's style of instructing, it maintains equal opportunities to all students, it keeps the structure of a standardized school project.\n \n To begin with, as a student, being familiar with the teaching style of your instructors is a very necessary component to doing well in certain classes. All teachers have a differnet style of teaching; depending on the way they feel comfortable conducting their lessons. However, not all students may be able to adapt to the style of a specific teacher. By assigning a teacher-designed summer assignment, this gives students the opportunity to take a quick glance at the way specific teachers conduct their lessons. This allows students to not only be ahead but also prepared at the start of the school year, knowing how their instructor assigns work.\n \n Furthermore, teacher-designed summer assignments maintain an equal opportunity to all students. This means, all students will be assigned the same project by the same teachers. Sometimes when students work together they may not be able to completely agree, meaning when they create a summer assignment; some students may not like the project and its format. However, if the assignment is created by the teachers themselves, it means the students can't question eachother, but only rely on the teachers abilities.\n \n Additionally, throughout the school year teachers will assign projects to students using not only school-wide but their own standards. If the summer projects assigned to students were created by the teachers themselves, the project will maintain this standard implemented by both the school board and staff. Unlike students, teachers have plenty of experience when it comes to educating young adults. Due to the experince teachers have in their field of study, they can create a better, more structured assignment using their personal views and insights on the subject. Many people may say that if the project was student-designed then the students could relate to the project more or the project would be more understandable. However, the students may accidentally cut corners when creating the project anf be held accountable. When teachers design the summer assignment, it maintains a well-rounded format and is also related to the lessons throughout the acedmic year.\n \n In conclusion, summer projects keep students in a working mindset and helps them stay dedicated to school. Projects that are created and assigned by the teachers are more reliable knowing the assignment has a standardized structure and will contain all the details in conducting the project. Allthough students may want to create a project they can easily complete due to the fact they created it, the project may not have all of the details it needs and will not contain the format implemented by the staff themselves.Â",

    Essay: "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to continue their learning over the summer. The question is should the students' projects be teacher- designed or student- designed? I believe summer projects should be teacher- designed. Teacher- designed projects are entirely beneficial than student- designed projects because students prepare themselves for college, it takes them less time to complete the projectÂ and help students develop many other skills needed in life.\n \n First, students are able to prepare for college with a teacher- designed project, by helping them get used to a criteria that comes with a project. Often time in college students are given certain requirements needed to get a passing score. For example, a student may have to write a 10 page report in MLA format when they attend college if they are not used to completing strict projects, they may not complete the courses needed in college. That is why it is imperative if students start now than to be left behind later.\n \n Second, summer projects should be straight to the point and shouldn't last an extended amount of time to complete.\n \n If students hit the basic points and objectives of a project than they will learn more about the specific subject and they will excel passed the standard qualifications of the project. If there is less time wasted on guessing what the teacher would like to see, than that gives students more time to enjoy their summer.\n \n Lastly, teacher- designed projects may help students excel in life. Teacher- designed projects are developed to encourage students in many different ways. For example, if the teacher assigns a report; that will help a student with word documents. Also, if a teacher assigns a speech as a project it will help students with their public speaking. Teachers help prepare students for their future and everything they will need in life.\n \n In conclusion, teacher- designed projects help students in many ways possible. They will be able to experience a taste of college, take less time with their project and help students in the long run . Some may say that summer projects should be student- based to encourage their minds of creativity and uniqueness, however without the guidence from a teacher students may not understand the importance of structured classwork . Schools should allow summer projects to be teacher- designed to help students reach their full potential.Â",

    Essay: "Summer projects are frowned upon by many students across the U.S, but why are they even assigned in the first place? They provide us with material to review and they also give us the opportunity to get something under our belt that we may have had complications with during the school year. Lately, an astounding amount of students believe that these project should be 'student designed' instead of ' teacher designed'. this means that these projects that help students review certain materials before the schools year start would be designed by the students and not the teacher. 'Teacher-designed' projects allow the students to review past material and to work on skills/subjects that they were struggling with.\n \n Teachers design these projects so their students can study all of the material, not just the the things that were simple and easy to complete. Having the students work on material that was taught during the year allows them to keep the information in their heads, so they won't forget things such as: how to solve for x when 2x+4=0 or what a fault line is. Every student willÂ have the material in their heads so when they come back to school they wont be struggling to pass.\n \n 'Teacher-designed' projects also allows students that are struggling with a certain piece of material to review it, work on it, and try to learn said piece. Every student across the Earth has at least one or two things that they struggle with during the year. Having teachers design the summer projects allows them to add in those specific points, so the students that are having trouble will have a chance to work on it. This also allows them to not have to struggle to pass in the up coming school year, if they do happen to take advantage of it.\n \n Students believe that they will be given too much work to complete resulting in them not being able to enjoy their summer. Now, if they would work on the project little by little everyday or every other day then they would get the assignment completed that way the could enjoy their summer without a care in the world. Most students decide to do the work last minute causing them to be stressed and get a low grade, due to the fact that they were rushing to get it completed by a certain time. they also believe if that if the students designed to project they could get it done quickly by only dded material that they know and that they are comfortable with, but what are they really getting out if it? Maybe. their whole summer to goof off and a decent grade when they go back to school? they wont the same opportunity of reviewing material if it was like this. causing them to struggle and possibly fail.\n \n Students mainly focus on getting the project done instead of focusing on what they need to learn or know by the fall. Teachers dont give us work to be mean, they give us this work because they want us to pass and so we have to correct material to move on in our young adult lives. Projects give us the chance toÂ show what we know and give us a chance to go over the things we know and what we should know.",

    Essay: "Some Schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Projects are used to enhance learning in a different way. During the summer no student wants to work on school work or even think about school. I think that summer projects should be teacher- designed because students may take a while to come up with a project or idea, teacher- designed projects are already made and ready to go, Projects would be less confusing when made by the teacher themselves.\n \n One reason I think that summer projects should be teacher-designed is because students may take a while to come up with ideas for the project or put it off. Students are in school at least 8 to 9 months or for some students all year around, so when it comes to summer break students are ready to relax, go on vacation, or just sleep. Students already have done tons of projects for classes or even just for one class and those projects are very stressful for some. Summer in a lot of cases are relax time and forget about school time so when they are given a project to do a lot would just put it to the side and dont do it at all. When coming up with ideas on what to do some will not know or just not even try that's why it think it should be teacher-base.\n \n Another reason that summer projects should be teacher-based is that teacher-based projects are already made in advance and are ready to go during summer and all the students have to do is follow the instructions of the project itself. If students are given the instructions and already know the idea it makes it a little easier to get done over the summer. Students tend to procrastinate and take their time, which they should, but that time may be at the last minute. It could be August and they have to go back to school that following week and haven't even came up with an idea yet. Teacher-based projects already have the idea and the instructions on how to do it and it saves time depending on the project. Students can still not do it at all but at least they have the foundation on what to do and start it and have it done with in weeks or days.\n \n Furthermore, Teacher- based projects may be less confusing then when a student comes up with it from the top of their head. Students already dont want to do the project in the first place so the idea may be very confusing to other students or the teacher. If the project is a group project the idea may not be understood fully and may get taking the wrong way. Students school brains are already shut down so when to making ideas students tend to wing it and just throw it out especially when it is a group project. They think that the other is just going to figure it out on their own and that may not be the case or they leave each other hanging. Teacher- based projects make it easier because the idea and instructions are already there and all the students have to do is just follow them.\n \n However, Teacher-based projects do have a downside to them. Teachers, of course, have been teaching and assigning projects all year and some are easy and some are not. Projects that are given by the teacher have to be completed by the instructions given and if it is not completed that way or in that way all that hard work just went down the drain. Student- based project do make it easier because it is their idea, their instructions, and their own way. So all that hard work doesn't have to go the drain for nothing. Student-based projects can be more creative because it is made from scratch and from their own head. Teacher-based projects are usually less creative because students are just trying to finish it and get it over with. In contrast, students may take a lot of time or wait till the last minute.\n \n In conclusion, Teacher- based projects or student based projects can all be very good projects. Summer projects can be challenging because the summer is relaxing time, even though all of adults think otherwise, but summer projects do keep the brain fresh. I think that summer projects should be teacher based because it makes it easier on them and the students.Â",

    Essay: "When you think of summer projects do you think of fun,active,joyfull times and eciting learning? When you think of a teacher asigning a summer project you don't think of it being eciting. You think of restricted activies,rules,and limmited time. These characteristics might even take away from a student wanting to do summer projects. This is why I stongly agree that students should design the summer project because they have the right to do what they enjoy and not feel they are limited to their ideas.\n \n Students don't want to be stress all summer about a project their teacher assigned them. They should be granted to do what they want on their summer break. By allowing students to do their own summer projects lets them do what they enjoy the most. This makes it easier for them to complete and not be stressed out. This could let them have a great score coming back from summer break.\n \n Having a summer project and letting students create it lets them think of many ideas. This lets them not feel limited of what they can or can't do. For eample everything around us involves math student could group up and measure who can throw a football the longest distince. Letting students create a project for themselfs can boost their creativity and learn difrerent things around them. In this generation kids just want to stay inside on the phone this lets them get out and think of wounderful new things.\n \n Some people may disagre the statement of letting students creating thier own summer project. This could lead to students being foucsed too much on having fun than learning and completing the project. Students may not have hte experence of doing projects and leaving them stressed and confused. Students may not feel its nesecaery do to when its not assigned by a teacher. Which means student will fail and start off their upcoming year failing classes.\n \n Summer projects should make you think of an easy and fun thing to do. If you had a project to do how would you would want enjoyable By allowing student to create their own gives them the chance to know what they are capable of imaging. Also letting student not think projects are not just about thinking too hard but allowing them to create a project from what they love doing.

    Essay: "Every year when summer break rolls around, students become restless and excited. But as soon as they get comfortable and begin to relax and enjoy the stress-free summer life, the realization that they have school projects to do hits them like a ton of bricks, oftentimes draining the enjoyment from their time on break. Many school teachers find it easiest and most convenient to design a project and assign it to the students, but this just ends up turning into a chore for students. What if, to lessen the students' feelings of resentment towards summer projects, the teachers allowed the projects to be student-designed? Although some believe that required summer projects should be teacher-designed, in reality it is much more beneficial to the student for the projects to be student-designed.\n \n Required summer projects should be student-designed because when students are in control of their project, they are able to express themselves and an interest they may have through the assignment. Teachers, when designing the project they assign, may feel that by providing parameters and a rubric for an assignment they are helping the student out. In reality, they are just limiting the student to think in the way the teacher thinks. On the other hand, when students design the project, they are better able to express a passion they would like to share with others. For example, a project that requires the student to read a book and do a report on the character symbolism simply becomes a chore in the eyes of the student. This student may have a passion for nature and animals, yet there would be no way for them to express that passion within the confinement of a literary analysis project. If the student were able to design the project by his or herself, it would immediately become less of a chore as they would have the freedom to do the project on something they love, be it nature, music, art, athletics, science, or any other topic of their choice. It is almost guaranteed that a student will put more effort into a project regarding a topic they are interested in. When students have a say in their assignment, it no longer feels like a pointless task forced upon them by a superior; thus, the quality of the project will likely be higher as they will feel motivated when the assignment allows them to express themselves.\n \n When students design their own projects, they develop independence that shapes them as an individual and prepares them for later in life. By telling their students exactly what to do for a summer project, teachers may be making it easier for the student in the short term. In the long term however, they are restricting the student's independence and individuality by not allowing them to make their own mature choices in designing their own project. When a student is allowed to design their own project, they are making small choices that teach them how to think and make choices independently and creatively without constant oversight. As well as training the student to make their own decisions, designing a project teaches individuals to have confidence. This is a much needed trait for teenagers nowadays who often times lack the self-confidence needed to pursue something they have a passion for. It is beneficial to society to instill self-confidence, individuality, and independence in students so that they are able to pursue their passions in life. These traits that can arise from something as simple as designing one's own project prepare individuals for life in the real world to be productive citizens that can make a difference in the world.\n \n Something as simple as a required summer project can have lasting effects on students if they are allowed to design it themselves and are not confined by the boundaries instilled by their teacher. When a student is able to design the project them self, they are able to express passions they may otherwise have no way to express and will likely create a higher quality project because of their interest in a topic. Also, designing the project by one-self instills confidence, independence, and individuality which are valuable traits today in teenagers transitioning to adulthood. Although some believe that required summer projects should be teacher-designed, the benefits that result from allowing the project to be student-designed can potentially shape an individual to be ready to go out into the real world and make a difference.Â",

    Essay: "Summer can either be the best time of the year or the worst. With a mixture of the heat, mosquitoes, and stress about the new comingÂ school year, summer has its troubles. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to show learning is being done outside of school. The debate occurs with deciding if the projects should be student or teacher designed. Summer projects should be student-designed because it allows for creativity, one learns time management, and one can exercise self-reliance.\n \n One reason why summer projects should be student-designed is that it allows for creativity. Without strict guidelines, students can produce original content. This will make grading better for teachers because they see a variety of projects. Creativity is important to a student because it will make the project more interesting. Students like to make a project their own and will overall put in a substantialÂ amount of effort when they can be creative. One can easily see how student-designed projects allow for creativity.\n \n Another reason why summer projects should be student-designed is that one learns time management. A student learns time management because they have a set period of time to create their projects. Students will have the ability to manage when they start their projects and can decide when the time is best for them. When students learn time management it helps them prepare for life outside of school as well as build character. It can be concluded that student-designed projects allow one to learn time management.\n \n The final reason why summer projects should be student-designed is that one can exercise self reliance. When a student creates their own project, they rely fully on themselves. Self-reliance is a skill that can only be gained by practicing. This is a great skill to have because one will need it in the future. It is beneficial to start learning how to be self reliant as soon as possible. While creating summer projects, one can clearly see that students gain the important life skill of self-reliance.\n \n Some people may think summer projects should be teacher-designed because it prevents confusion, but if students have questions they can easily email their teacher. Because one can be creative, learns time management, and exercises self-reliance, summer projects should be student-designed. The next time you meet with a school teacher, talk to them about how important it is to get students involved in creating their own projects. Without student-designed projects, students would be miserable and hate their summer. Make a change in the community around you for the better, and improve students lives for generations.Â",

    Essay: "Just because it is summer break does not mean kids should stop learning. Some schools have required summer projects to ensure this learning continues. One issue they have come across when doing this is should these projects be student or teacher-designed? Summer projects should be student-designed because some students have limited time, allowing them to design it will create more motivation to do it, and it is their time off to relax.\n \n Summer may be a break from school but this does not mean that all students have completely unlimited time.\n \n Many students hold a job over the summer in order to save or just get money. Allowing for student-design enables students to ensure that they have the ability to complete the project even if they are working. Finding a work and school life balance can be hard, but allowing students to have a little control can help ensure that they can find that balance. Summer is the time of the year where many people go on vacation. Students going on vacation should be able to enjoy family or friend time without stressing over the project. Student-design is going to help them know that they can complete the project without hassle or worry. Having projects be student-designed helps students with limited time manage the learning alongside their work or vacation time.\n \n Motivation makes the task at hand a lot easier compared to when someone is unmotivated. Motivation is a big factor when it comes to a workload. If projects are student designed this will create motivation for them to complete it. Having the projects fit what the students want is helpful in making sure the project is reaching completion. Designing their own projects in comparison to the teachers designing it helps ensure that the student is actually interested in it and will truly learn from the experience. Learning is a daily part of everyones life. Students having a choice in a school system where almost everything is designed for them by someone else is a welcome change. Having this choice of what the project should be is going to increase motivation greatly.\n \n Summer is a time of relaxation. Summer break is specifically for students and faculty to have time off from the stressful school year. Students should be able to relax since they have worked so hard the whole year. Designing their own projects is a way to enable them to be stress-free due to them choosing the concept of the project. Stress plays a big role in an individuals happiness. Having time to de-stress is hugely important for anyone, not just students. Choosing what they want their project to be is going to create a more relaxing summer for students so they feel they can reach completion. Having time off is very important for students.\n \n When it comes to summer projects student-design is the way to go. Allowing students to create their projects will make life a lot easier for the students while still ensuring they receive some sort of education while on summer break. In conclusion, the summer projects should be student designed because some students have limited time due to work or vacation, giving them the creative freedom to design it is going to help with motivation, and last but not least it is their much needed time to relax.",

As a current student i know school can be really stressful,sometimes it can be more than we can handle.\n \n students should be able to relax and do some otherÂ things over the summer,but they should also be ready for the upcoming year.

    Essay: "Over the summer, many teachers assign projects that are due the first day back to school. Usually, they are teacher-designed and all students must complete them the way the teacher would like them to be completed. What if the teacher decided to allow students to create their own assignment to be turned in the first day of school? Many students would love for that to happen because then they can make the assignment as simple and easy as possible because that would mean less work for the student over the summer. Personally, the teacher-designed assignments are better than a student-designed assignment for many reasons. This will assure the student has a structure to go on that is the same for all students, this also assures that every student has the same assignment and it would be up to them to make it their own and be creative. Also, if a student had a self-designed assignment the chances of actually getting good work are very small because no student, or teacher, wants to do work over the summer.\n \n Assuring the student has a good structure to go on for the assignment is a strong key point in having a teacher-designed assignment. When the teacher assigns the work over the summer they obviously give each student the same assignment which means there is a structure behind the work. If a student designed their own guidelines then each student could come up with something different but sometimes they may be too different and it may be harder for a student to understand an assignment that way. Personally, a teacher-designed assignment is more beneficial because then the teacher gives you the criteria needed and it is up to the student to complete the work correctly and we can also be creative as long as we are inside the lines of what the teacher actually wants. This somewhat teaches students structure and discipline in a way because when a teacher asks for something done a certain way we, as students, are expected to do it that way and it is kind of like a job. At a real world job if your boss gives you a work project you do it, that is the same dynamic as a student and a teacher.\n \n With a teacher-designed assignment this makes sure all students have the same criteria, what the students do for the assignment from that point on is on them. Everyone can have the same assignment but can be as creative as they would like to be. Typically a student would want to design their own assignment for the creativity factor of it all but little do they realize even if a teacher gives them strict guidelines there are different ways to carry out an assignment in your own way but still reaching what the teacher asks for. The point of a teacher-designed assignment is to give the students all the same thing or at least give the students all the same options on what they can do. With or without the options, the student should still be completing what the teacher asks them to. School is so much like the real world, job wise. When the boss gives their workers an assignment those workers better do it and do it right or they won't be in very good standings. The same goes for when a teacher gives the student an assignment, either the student will do it to their best abilities or they will have to suffer with the bad grade as a punishment.\n \n Finally, if the teacher allowed the students to create their own assignments there's no telling what kids will bring in. Nobody, not even teachers, want to work over the summer. With that being said, without a good bases for an assignment kids will easily do the most minimum amount of work possible. Which then leads to a terrible grade and little to no foundation. Being a student takes a lot of responsibility and discipline, a teacher-designed assignment teaches a lotÂ of the responsibility and discipline simply by meaning if it's not done the student will pay for not doing it. Having a student-designed assignment doesn't always teach really good discipline because the child can do what they want to a degree without having to really show their fullest potential.\n \n In conclusion, a teacher designed assignment is far better than a student-designed one. The reasons above aren't even close to all of the possible reasoning for my answer, the biggest reasoning is based on teaching responsibility. A student has to maintain responsibility in order to be a good student and doing a summer project correctly based on how the teacher assigned it, shows how responsible and dedicated that student is compared to others who choose not to do the assignment.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

    Essay: "Summer can be a time for students to have fun and enjoy the wonders of the world, however summer does not mean one can take a break from learning. Every summer, students are required by theirÂ schools to complete a project during their break to assure students continue to learn. Summer projects are generally teacher-designed and based off a strict outline, which can limit the students creativity. Summer projects should be student-designed because it will motivate students to expand their learning, engage their creativity, and it will create a sense of accomplishment in the alumni, which will set them up for success.\n \n Every year more and more students fail to complete their summer projects. One might think that they are not being completed because students do not care enough to compile to what is being asked of them. In reality students do not complete their summer projects because there is a lack of interest between the student and the theme of the project. Students should be able to design their own projects as it can motivate them to expand their knowledge while on summer vacation. Typically teacher-designed projects are based off of a strict format where a student is given a topic to research and write about. Although, many may say that having projects formatted this way will set up students for the future, they fail to realize the damage that is being done to a students interest in learning. When a student is forced to research a topic that is not of interest to them they tend to only provide what is needed of them. They do not attempt to further learn about the topic more than are required to because the goal in mind is: what is the quickest way I can get this done? However, when one allows a student to decide what they would like to create a project on one can see the excitement radiate off of their face. The student becomes motivated to start designing their project because it will be based on a topic they are passionateÂ about.\n \n In addition to, motivating students to expand their learning horizons, allowing students to create their own projects instead of having teacher-designed projects will allow students to engage their creative side. As said before, many teacher-designed projects have a cemented format in which they prefer their student's project's to be formatted in leaving little to any space for student creativity. By giving the student an all accesses pass to creating their own student-designed project, it allows for students to think out side the box. For instance, instead of the alumni creating a PowerPoint with several slides of repeating information, the student could design their project through a form of art. Take for example, a student who is doing a project on how pollution affects the oceans;He or she could paint a picture to further depict and attract the audiences attention to the topic being discussed. The student would also benefit tremendously through the ability of using their creativity as It has been scientifically proven that people who use their creativity are most likely to excel academically. Each and every student is smart however, at times students are unable to demonstrate this as a result of teacher-designed summer projects.\n \n Lastly, think about a time in which you have had to work extremely to accomplish a goal and you reached it. Do you remember the pure excitement you felt as you looked back at your painstakingly hard work and realized that it was all worth it? That is the exact feeling students will feel after completing their summer projects. Students should be allowed to design their own projects as it will give students a sense of accomplishment. when the student realizes what they can do if they are determined, the student will then be furthermore motivated to do well in school and in other aspects of their life. For example, in cartoons, when a character is faced with an obstacle, trains to overcome the obstacle, and overcomes it ;it plants a seed of self confidenceÂ that will only flourish as time goes by. Like that seed the student will flourish into a responsible and academicallyÂ smart student.\n \n Students have been completing teacher-designed projects for too long and it is now time for a change by allowing students to design their own summer projects to motivate them to expand their knowledge, creativity, and to set them up for success. As a result of permitting students to do this, every student will develop a loveÂ for the free education that is provided to them. Are you willing to give students this opportunity?

    Essay: "Students often complain about having homework, regardless of what time of year it is. Summer break is usually a time for students to relax without the fear of having to do any school work. They do not know that in the long run, having take home projects will be beneficial to their school, and life, careers. Through doing summer projects, students receive more learning opportunities and help create a sense of organization and time management. Students who collaborate with teachers on putting together these projects will help them be more willing and enthusiastic about doing them over their summer break.\n \n Summer projects give students an open opportunity to learn new things before starting a new year of school. Researching and putting together a project of all the information one has learned is a great way to gain more knowledge that may be crucial for their next year of classes. Eigth grade year, before school ended, our teacher told us there would be a summer project that our whole grade had to complete before we entered ninth grade. All of us were not enthusiastic about this information, we did a lot of complaining. Our teacher then told us that we would, as a group, decide on a project. Many options were presented to us. Projects on the Roman Empire, Hinduism, Greek Mythology, and even the Egyptian Empire were all options for us to choose from. After many minutes of arguing and ruling out options one by one, the class came to the decision of Greek mythology. It was required that we work in groups and collaborate on the project. Over the summer, my group would have meet up's and Skype sessions to find ways to make our project more interesting. I enjoyed this project more than I thought I would. Mythology was very interesting and it gave me something to do over our long break. Also, It helped me with the first unit of our world studies class, which was based upon the Greek Gods, Godesses, and tales of ancient greece. By deciding as a class, we ultimately chose a project that we all enjoyed to do, and it gave us an advantage to have already known things by the time we reached ninth grade.\n \n Organization and time management are two skills that highschoolers and adults find beneficial to have when it comes to doing any type of work. Our summer project on mythology was time consuming, but our group knew it had to be done. At the beginning of summer, the group I was in decided that every week, on Wednesday night, we would either meet up or video chat to work on and research our project for at least an hour and a half. This helped us manage our time and priorities with other things we had to do in life. We spent the first half of our Wednesday nights researching many of the tales of ancient Greece and the Gods and Godesses associated with them. Our second half of Wednesday's was dedicated to putting together our creative elements of our project. We assigned eachother different mini projects to do, and worked together on creating a large tri-fold poster dedicated to the basic facts of our project. By creating this plan, we managed to get our project done with two weeks left before school would start. It taught me to be deligent in my work and how to be organized while also working with other people.\n \n Some students, and even teachers may argue that summer break is meant for the students to enjoy their time off and relax without worry and stress of homework. I think that while homework and projects may be stressful, If it is something I somewhat enjoy, it will help me push through the work and gain knowledge that I may need in the future. Students will not always have summer break, and after their education, we will have to spend almost everyday working. It is good to get into the habit of starting and finishing tasks on time, because in the future, many of us will need the skills and characteristics to succeed in our jobs and careers.\n \n Students who decide and do summer projects will be presented with chalenges, but being able to gain knowledge and have fun while doing it will always be a good idea. To teach students how to manage their time and priorities will help them in future situations and create a long lasting affect on the way they go about working on projects and turning on their best work on time.",

Their are many ways to learn information. Student's can learn information through watching a video, reading, or even experiencingÂ it in real life. After gathering their information,Â students can make a poster, a presentation, a news article, a website, or even write a song about it.

I will use the information I already know about the subject and research more information.

    Essay: "Summer break is all about fun and hanging out with friends. But it is important for students to continue to learn during this period. The smallest things can help students continue their education during break. This task can be made possible if students could design their own projectsÂ rather than relying on the teachers. The summer projects should not be teacher-designed because instructors control class and projects during the school year. One project that is student-designed will give the students a turn to control the expectations and rubric. If students could manage and design their own projects, it would give them an opportunity to create something that expresses their interests while enjoying their summer break.\n \n When students are let out of school for summer break they are looking forward to the time off from school. The warm weather makes it fun to hang out with friends outdoors and go swimming. But if teachers were create and design a project for students to complete then that would be taking the fun out of summer break. It would be a hassle for students to be required to complete a teacher-designed project rather than the students designing the requirements and topic for the project. If the students have to take time out their summer to complete a project then it should designed by them. During the entire school year students are required to complete assignments at their instructors expense. Students are in school for more than half of the year, it is important that they can enjoy their lengthy summer break without being controlled by their teachers. If the students are required to complete a project during their summer break then it should be designed by the students. Summer break is meant to give students time to relax from stressful, hefty homework. It would be unfair to students if they were required to complete a project that was teacher-designed due to the importance for students to experience a stress-free break rather than worrying about due dates for assignments and tests.\n \n Summer work is no fun for any student. It will be hard to convince any student to continue their education during their summer break because summer is all about no homework or projects. A way around that issue is giving the students a chance to complete the project at their own pace and interest. Any summer projects or assignments for students should be based around their interest rather than teachers interest. During the summer students will be busy having fun with friends, going on vacation or enjoying their time off from school. If a teacher assigns students an assignment or project that is not appealing, the chances of the students putting 100% effort into the project is slim. Also, the chances of students actually completing a teacher-based project efficientlyÂ is slim as well. But, if it was a student-designed project, the completion rate would skyrocket due to the fact the students would actually want to do the summer work. It will be hard for students to motivate and push themselves to complete a project if it is boring. Teacher-design summer work would be unfair to students that would like to control their education and topic. Projects and assignments based on the students interest would exemplifyÂ better work ethic and dedication. It is important for students to continue learning during the summer, but it should be learning based on their interests and goalsÂ rather than any teacher.\n \n It would not be a good decision to let students design and control their own summer projects or assignments because it is important students are learning the correct material necessary for class. It would be pointless for students to complete a summer assignment or project if it was not based on the school's curriculum. A teacher-designed project would be more beneficial for the students than allowing the students to design their own project, The instructors are aware of the things the students will be required to learn during the school year. If the teachers would be allowed to control the summer work then it would give the students a head startÂ on the upcoming material in their classes. Overall, the teacher's should control the requirements and rubric for the summer work because the students would learn things that are related to school rather than researching things that are irrelevant to anything they would be exposed to during the school year.\n \n Moreover, students should be given the freedom to choose any topic for their summer work rather than letting the teachers design the projects. Summer is about free time and preparing for the next school year to come. But, if students had to worry and stress about a difficult, teacher-deigned project then it would be sucking the fun out of summer break. It would be unfair for teachers to require students to complete an assignment based on the instructors expectations. It would be easier for students to show their hobbies and interests through a project that they would enjoy rather than letting the instructor choose.Â",

    Essay: "Some schools require sudents to complete summer projects to assure that they continued learning during their break. In order for the school to know weather their students learned over their break, their summer projects must be teacher designed.\n \n When it comes to projects that are required by the school, the projects should have high standards; which means they should be teacher-designed. Teachers put a lot of thought into their students assignments, they think about things that the student may learn in the process of doing their work. They are the ones who teach and push students to their limit so that they can benefit from it in the long run. If the projects were to be student-designed, the students will not put the same amount of effort in their work. They will not put the same amount of thought, instead they will take the easy way out which does not benefit the student intelectually. Now the easy way out for a student would be making the projects topic on something they already know by heart. This would lead the school into thinking that their student's learned something new during the summer.\n \n In order for a student to learn over their break, they will need something a bit challenging. Something that will exercise their mind and lead them into puting more thought into their project. Usually when teachers assign projects, they give their students a rubric explaining what they expect from their work. Rubrics have standards, it gives students an idea of how their project may be great or awful. Some students may look at it and think about how they want it to be a succesful project, others will look and think about how they can improve their work. By teachers using this method they can see who really worked hard on their projects. Another way of knowing if the student's have learned would be by teachers assigning every student an individual topic. None of the students would be able to copy off of eachother for answers, they would have to find their own information.\n \n Another way that the school would be able to assure that their students learned over break would be by a report made by a teacher. Teachers can now use certain apps to see if their students have logged in and completed a certain part of the summer project. Some teachers may assign students relieable website's recommended by the county or state in order for students to use over the summer so that they can exercise their minds. When using the site's the students would have to use specific log in account's that would connect to the teachers account. That would let the teacher see if they have been using it and if they are struggling in certian subjects in the class. Plus all the data would be recorded and could easily be sent to the school so that they can see in better depth of what their students are learning. This would be a great way to make sure that the students are learning over their break.\n \n The only way for the school to know if the students are learning and completing their summer projects would have to be with teacher-designed projects. Teachers truley care about their students and want them to do the best that they can. Whenever students get the liberty of doing something on their own, they often cheat or end up doing anything and calling it work. But with putting standards in, it changes the entire way the student thinks and how they process everything because of the requirments they must meet. By pushing students that extra mile the school will be able to tell if they have learned once break is over and they will see improvements in their work by the time they come back from break.

    Essay: "Most schools require some kind of work for students to do over the course of the summer outside of school. Usually, these assignments are to keep topics fresh in the minds of the students so that they can retain the information for the coming school year. These assignments do refresh the student on the topics that they have learned; however, the students rarely apply themselves to these assignments. Students do not see a point to these assignments because they don't think of the long term benefits of these assignments as the cause for their success in school. I think that these summer assignments should be designed by teachers so that they cover the necessary topics, but take into account the students requests as well. These summer assignments designed by teachers are critical because it helps the student succeed, saves time, and promotes learning.\n \n If students were allowed to be completely in control of their summer work, they would chose one of three things: not to do it, do only the topics they are comfortable with, or chose something they are actually interested in. Most students will opt for not doing these assignments and having the summer for themselves. However, when the students arrive back at school, not having done any work to prepare for the school year, the teachers will have to take time in class to reteach everything that was learned in the previous year. These summer assignments are difficult, but they without-a-doubt help a student succeed. Personally, when I was given an optional summer assignments, I did not complete it and I struggled immensely with the curriculum until I took the time to actually review the material. I have no doubt that if I had done that summer assignment I would have had a much better start to the year. With this option available to students to \"self-design,\" the students will not properly prepare themselves as much as teachers will, and therefore will not succeed as much.\n \n When summer assignments are given, it allows for students to refresh themselves on the topics that they had learned previously, and perhaps new topics that they will be covering in the coming year. This allows for the teachers to briefly cover what was learned previously and then move on to new topics. If teachers didn't design the summer assignment, then these topics would have to be reviewed in class before starting any new topics. This makes the first few weeks of the school year even more chaotic because every teacher will have to speed through each of the topics necessary for the curriculum in order to make up that time.\n \n Also, when students learn some of the topics before coming to school, it helps the teacher get though the topics quicker by not having to explain as much. When the students do not have the summer assignments designed by the teacher, they do not learn the new topics, and therefore have to spend more time on them in class. For example, most classes have summer assignments so that they can avoid having to review a bunch of material before learning the new curriculum. Given these points, teacher-designed summer assignments are critical to save time for the new information to be covered during the year.\n \n Finally, these summer assignments promote independent learning for students. They teach students how to find information and time management, which are necessary skills for college and future careers. Research based summer assignments are valuable to learning because they are flexible in the structuring but also cover the topics necessary. If a teacher told students to write a short essay to summarize a few topics that they have learned or are interested in learning about, the students will apply themselves more than having to write out ten pages of notes on a book. This type of summer assignment requires actual thinking and creativity from a student. When a student is given fifty math problems they have done before, they learn nothing, but when given twenty and a small creativity based project, they will actually fully apply themselves to the work. This will also cause students to not resent the work that they are doing and hopefully cause for a better school year to come.\n \n For these reasons I agree that there should be teacher-designed summer assignments, but I also believe that they should be more engaging and interesting for students so that they apply themselves and retain the information. The summer assignments that the teachers assign now are not engaging in the least and cause the students to dread having to come back to school. I think that the core topics that need to be reviewed should be given by the teacher, but that the teacher should allow for the students to work creatively on part of the assignment, this may cause for less dread by the students. With these types of assignments, both the teachers and students can be successful during the coming school year.Â",

Teacher-designed projects and student-designed projects are both great ideas but the projects that the teachers have made themselves in a better route to go. A teacher's project would not only be more beneficial towards the future of students and push them to go to greater lengths with their knowledge but they will also assure that the what student is doing that will actually help them learn during their summer vacation.\n \n Children are the future and should think wisely about their life in the long run so that they can have the best life possible. All successful lifestyles do not always start with going to college, getting your degree, and finding a well-paying job it can start from inside your garage like Steve Jobs did to create\n \n Apple . Although not all will be as lucky as Steve Jobs. Therefore, it would be a wise choice for students to go to college to get their life started on the right track. Projects like the ones given out during break could possibly prepare them for what they will see when they do go to college. Especially if they take honors or AP classes during high school, unfortunatelyÂ those projects will be a bit more difficult but they will be more beneficial so that the students to know what to expect in the long run.\n \n These projects will also push the students to go to greater lengths and actually think it out for themselves without asking for a teachers help or looking it up online. With that, giving the students a project made to further their education and challenge them a tad bit would be a project made by certified educators themselves. Being challenged is an essential thing to do to everyone. Therefore, the student will know that they are smarter than what they believe when they finally understand some work that may be a little challenging. Giving students even the littlest push will be better than them not trying at all. Students should think for themselves and want to challenge themselves and not try to cheat off others or from online sources. Student-designed projects would not give students the kick start that they need in life.\n \n Although having student-designed projects would be more creative and within the comfort zone of the students, having a teacher-designed project would most likely achieve the goal of the students learning during summer vacation. Assuring that the students do indeed learn during their duration away from school is a big factor of giving them teacher-designed projects. Teachers could give out projects that are fun, educational, and challenging keeping in mind it will still be teaching them from outside of the classroom. It would not help the the student nor the teacher if the student learn nothing from their summer project. It would be more stress on both people, more teaching for the teaching and more work and learning for the student. Therefore, them learning from outside the classroom would be greatly achieved by the teachers making the projects for the students.\n \n Given these reasons, teachers should be the only ones making summer projects for their students. Being more beneficial towards the future of the students, pushing them to go to greater lengths with their knowledge and assuring that they are actually learning is better than having easy projects that can be done within fifteen minutes. Students at least be given the opportunity to create a project and allow a teacher to look over it to see if it falls under those 3 reasons. Teachers should also try to at least make it enjoyable for everyone not just for the students it would be pretty boring to grade a boring project.

In schools students arent given the opportunity to be as creative as they could be because of how restrictive and bland the projects and assignments made by teachers are. If our society depends on the creativity and skill setÂ of the current generation in schools why not give them the opportunity to develop their skills and be able to flourish in their own success? Which is why I think that summer projects should be student designed because its helps students learn to become more creative and helps prepare them for the future.\n \n Students usually spend their summer either sleeping or just having fun with their friends trying to make the most out of the break but as students reach high schools they find that they have to do projects over the summer. Almost all students are annoyed at the fact that they have to do a summer project for a class and most of them leave it till the last second to actually do it. If students were allowed to design these projects themselves it would give them the will and incentive to do it because they would have designed it in a way that it would seem interesting to them. It would help break away from their habit of carelessly doing it and having them get creative with their project and make something astonishing,\n \n By letting students design their own projects to do over the summer it also helps them develop real life skills that they can use in the workplace. Students dont tend to learn anything new over the summer since they are focused on their break and enjoying it as much as possible but doing a project that takes time and interests them helps them learn what goes into making a project and what the requirements are. This helps students to use their new foundÂ abilities in the workplace to much more easily express their creativity since they now know the tools to show it.\n \n When teachers make summer projects for students it makes it harder for a student to care about the project because they didnt really have a part in making it, so if the teachers decide on making a project based on a topic a student doesnt like they wouldnt be as interested. It would lead to them wanting to do the bear minimum and be done with it, never even inspiring them use their creativity. Which is why when a student makes their own project they can be more creative and choose a topic or idea that interests them related to the class doing their best effort to portray how much they care about it.\n \n It could be argued that if students made their own projects they would make it easy that it wouldnt take any time for them to finish it. Although some students would just want to be done with their project and do something easy most students would want to use this project as an opportunity to get their point and ideas across. When a person cares about something they want it to be the best , so when a student designs a project in whichÂ they care about they would obviously want to do their best since they put so much work into it. So saying that a student wouldnt care about a project they created would be wrong since even if they did design a bad project they would be the one doing it and would make it much harder for themselves.\n \n There is so much good that can come out of letting students design their own projects not only for them but for their future as well. If teachers give students the opportunity to design their own project then they would be teaching more than the class but skills they can use in the future as well. Since creativity is the backbone of everything in the world when teachers start to make new ideas to have students think more creatively it helps the development of new ideas and innovations in the future.",

    Essay: "Is it fair to have teachers design summer projects for students on break? During school, projects are normally done throughout the course to show a student's understanding of a subject. Most schools don't assign summer projects for the student body since summer is supposed to be the break time. Some schools do give out summer projects, but keep in mind, the projects themselves, despite being assigned during break, aren't usually designed by students. Summer projects should be student-designed because people work better with ideas they're familiar with, this gives students more freedom with subjects for a project, and students are more willing to do something they want to do or research.\n \n When working on projects, its easier to work with something you're familiar with than anything else. Making a project on a familiar concept means students would be able to write more in-depth about it. They'd also be able to understand it better since looking something up doesn't always give you enough info about a subject. Imagine trying to write a in-depth analysis on Didgeridoos when you've never even heard of one or even have background information on instruments. Familiarity with your work makes it come to you naturally and having the freedom to choose the subject of a project is important.\n \n Being able to choose what you're working with will make a project more enjoyable. Most of the time, teacher-assigned projects would have all the students doing or researching the same thing. While this makes the assignment easier to grade and gives everyone a common goal, some people want to look somewhere else. Choosing your subject could bring about interesting results and give you a new interest rather than just being given the generic science project where you monitor and grow a small plant for x amount of time. Working on something you, personally, picked out could also inspire you to put more work into the assignment.\n \n Being willing to do your work helps greatly with work ethic and attitude towards the work. Researching a subject that interests you, rather than something else, would make anyone more productive. There are lots of ideas people would look further into if prompted and this would be that prompt. Students would be able to enjoy looking up information on subjects interesting to them and put them on paper. They'd be able to turn in a well-written paper and get a good grade just for researching a fun subject.\n \n In conclusion, having students create their own summer projects would be highly beneficial towards productivity on said project. The benefits outweight the negatives and more students would work harder on these projects. Being limited to certain ideas will make it so students don't try as hard to think outside the box. This type of work also helps students find things they're interested in for later. All of these things would help them work better and earn better results, but they'd also find more information and learn better this way and isn't that the point of all this?",

    Essay: "Most kids don't like school as it is and its boring to them. The student-designed summer project would be better in their favor Because studens don't get to say much besides ask questions, and They have more say and more of a voice, and not every student learns the same, and summer is better than the school year because you can do more outside activities.\n \n The project would be great for students to learn and have fun because you can do things like have a lessons with the activities where the kids can pick between thing because not all kids like everything to be just told to them. kids feel better when they can have fun and everything isn't crammed in their brains for 7 hours a day. Which would make them tired and not ready to learn. This would be perfect for students who are hands on type of learners. They can be hands on because the project is student based. Not every kid learns the same so kids who learn differently would be more comfortable because its not a 7 hour classroom environment where they just sit in class all day.\n \n Student would have more say or more of a voice because is about them.\n \n During the school year in the fall and winter because the teacher basically run the class and they teach they way they want and the kids just listen. By making the project student based students can present thier feelings and their feedback about what they like and don't like. It can also help teacher get a better undestanding about their students. They can also create bonds with new people such as students and teachers. Nobody want to be taught by a teacher they don't like. This will cause kids not being motivated to learn from the teacher and will probably cause bad behavior.\n \n The project willalso make kid have more fun and they'll probably like school. You can do more activies that kids will like, like going to the pool, or planning a picnic, or just playing on a playground. You could make it so that it could be a lesson in each activity. Then they will learn while having fun. It wold be a win for everyone. It can just belittle insintives that they can get because of the weather and little brain breaks so they dont get overwelmed. Students already don't like going to school and making it fun and in their favor will make them want to come.\n \n In conclusion students would overall like the summer project that is student designed over teacher disigned because not every student learns the same, students get more of a voice which means they get to pick between things they like, and school is just better in the summer because of the outside activities you can do.",

    Essay: "When students are on summer break they want to have fun. Some schools require students to do projects to make sure the students are still learning during the break. The summer projects should be student-designed because students can do topics they have better understanding of and students can learn more information on the topics they are doing.\n \n Students hate having school work during summer break, but if the students decide on what topic they wanna do it can be easier and fun. The projects can be on topics students really understand and actually have interest in. For example, what if the student loves the solar system they can do a topic on that and really understand it because they find interest in it. Students that understand there topics have a better chance at showing their teachers that they really understand and they know what they are doing. The more students understand the better the project will come out.\n \n While doing projects sometimes students need to look up information on topics they are doing. Students can learn more information on that topic. However , the teacher teaches students information about that topic, but what if they look up a topic and find more information than what the teacher told them . The students are finding out more information that can possibly help them in the long run. For example, say you picked how plants are developed, but your teacher gives you information about how plants are developed, but you find better information and its accurate.\n \n Some students think that projects during the summer are boring, but they can actually help them understand the topics more and can become really fun . School projects during the summer time may not be fun, but can really benefit students in the end and actually help them. These projects can be very helpful and can even prepare students for the next school year.

    Essay: "Many schools require their students to complete a summer project during break to assure that they continue learning while not in school. Some are simple, such as writing an essay about events that happen over the summer, while others are long and grueling such as keeping a detailed log of every day, which is something one teachers from Generic_School had us do. Some students however, find teacher-designed assignments to be a chore and a struggle because they are not interesting or engaging. In order to fix this problem,Â I believe that summer projects should be student-designed because the students can choose topics that will interest them and engage them, and because the projects will feel more relevant and engaging to students in similar age groups.\n \n By giving students the chance to choose their own project topic, it will insure that they will stay interested. For example, a few years ago, my band teacher sent us home before break with a project in which we would have to design our own marching band show and theme, the only restriction being that it had to be able toÂ be performed in under eight minutes. Everyone in the class was super excited to begin right away and many of us began planning and researching almost immediately. The amount of freedom given to us by our teacher made the project thrilling and the possibilities were endless! When we all got back from break, it was obvious how much work everyone had put into their projects and how passionate they were about them. There were dozens themes ranging from classic Rock and Roll to Star Wars. By giving us the freedom to choose the themes of our projects, my band teacher found a way to engage us all in an educational and enjoyable experience.\n \n Giving students the freedom to design their own projects also would insure that the project will be engaging and relevant to students in similar age groups. About a year ago, I went to a two-week engineering summer camp at a college I am interested in attending. There were students there from tenth through twelfth grade from all over the state, and the camp itself was actually run by a group of college students and a few professors. Over the course of the camp we learned all about engineering and future career fields we may be interested in, but we also were given an assignment. We had to design models of an Earth themed school in groups with the materials they provided before the end of the camp. To be honest, I had expected that we would have to take a test or fill out some questionnaire on what we had learned, given that we were at a college, so this was a nice surprise. Turns out that it was in fact the college students, and not the professors, who were in charge coming up with this project. Since they were not much older than us, they knew how to get us to apply the knowledgeÂ that we had learned in a way that we would enjoy. If all projects were done like this, I'm sure many of them would be of much higher quality than a teacher-designed project.\n \n However, there are some benefits to doing a teacher-designed project rather than a student-designed one. For one thing, rules and guidelines would most likely be very clear. One year, one of my elementary school teachers decided to let us do our own summer projects based on the events of our summer, and we would have to show up next September to present it to the class in a creative way. Let's just say that things did not work out in the end. I was one of about five students to get an A on the project because either the other kids just wrote things down on a sheet of notebook paper because they didn't know what else to do, or they had forgotten all about the assignment over the break. If the teacher had decided to give us all a few options to pick from for the project, there would most likely have been more A's.\n \n I do believe that there are real benefits in requiring students to complete projects over summer break, but I do wish that more teachers would give students more freedoms when it comes to selecting them. By using the students' input, students will be more interested in the assignment and will be more likely to complete them. If more teachers allowed students to select their own topics for these projects, the quality of the projects would most likely be better because it would be about something that the student was passionate about. If all teachers allowed more students to give suggestions and input into their lessons and projects, then the overall quality of schools and the desire to learn would increase.",

    Essay: "Would you want to spend your summer vacation doing a project? Some schools require students to complete assignments during summer to assure they continue to learn during their break. Now what if you had to do a project that required you to stay home for 6 weeks, but you were gone all summer? What if you had absolutely no interest in a topic you had to research? Rather than being teacher designed, school summer projects should be student-designed because it gives the students more motivation to complete the project, students enjoy doing assignments in which they are interested in, and it gives students a better opportunity to succeed.\n \n Students have more motivation to complete a project, if they are able to decide what it is that they will be doing. For instance, if I had to complete a project that required me to stay at the beach all day, I would totally do it! No one wants to do a project they have no interest in, therefore they have no sense of motivation to get it done. No basketball enthusiast wants to write a 4 page paper on the French Revolution.\n \n Not only does a student have more motivation to complete it, but they actually enjoy doing it too. All students have their passions and things they are intersted in, why not give them the chance to use those to their advantage. Doing a project is a lot more enjoyable when you are doing it on something you are passionate about. For example, if I were given the opportunity to complete a project based off of the history of the National Hockey League, something that I absolutely love, I would totally enjoy it!\n \n Allowing students to design their own projects gives them a better opportunity to succeed. When completing a project that you are not interested in doing, you are most likely not going to give it your best work. As a high school student athlete, my history papers usually do not turn out the best. Now if I were asked to write a paper about my development as a soccer player, I sure would get a better grade than I would on a history paper. I have learned from experience that motivation and success go hand in hand, and interest plays a big role in that.\n \n School summer projects should be student designed because it gives students a better oppportunity to succeed, it gives the students motivation to complete the assignment, and students enjoy doing assignments that they are interested in. No one wants to spend their summer doing a project that they have absolutely no interest in, but once students are given the chance to complete a project based off of their interests, they are sure to love it. If a school should chose to assign students a project during their summer break, they should at least allow the students to decide what they are going to do their project on.Â  Â Â Â",

    Essay: "Many schools around the country design and assign summer projects for students to complete over the summer break. This is help students continue to learn and keep their brains active during summer break. Summer assignments also help students prepare for their incoming classes by learning concepts before the year starts. To better benefit the student, summer assignments should be teacher-designed because teachers have more knowledge of the course curriculum and many students need a teacher who can lead them through new concepts of the class.\n \n Summer assignments are designed to help students maintain an active mind and prepare for their upcoming classes by learning course concepts before the school year starts. Teachers are trained for years to master the subject they are going to teach and mostly likely have already seen or learned the material in the class they are going teaching. Students do not know the course curriculum before they have taken the class. If the summer assignment was designed by the students, the assignment would not be as beneficially because students do not know what the curriculum of the class is.\n \n For example, in classes I have always been give assignments created by my teachers. But, one class my teacher gave us an open ended project where students could create their own project using our ideas. All the kids in my class took weeks and even months to find an idea for their project.Â The students in my class had no idea what the teacher was looking for and how to correlate their ideas into the class curriculum. However, a teacher already knows the curriculum. This will allows for a more efficient and beneficial way of learning for the student because the teacher can create assignments they know is related to the course.\n \n Not only do student not know the course concepts, students also do not have the skills to create assignments; students need a teacher leader to guide them through the new class. When learning a new concept, students can become overwhelmed if they do not understand the topics. At my school, some classes have very little guidance from teachers to help the students understand a new topic. My friends in these classes become very overwhelmed and become more apathetic to the class. Students do not understand how to learn a new without the guidance of a teacher. A teachers job is to create assignments, tests, and projects to lead their students towards mastering a concept. When teachers create assignments they are more involved with guiding their students. If summer assignments were student-designed there would be a lack of guidance compared to an assignment made from a teacher would have. This would causes students to inefficiently learn through summer assignments.\n \n People who support student-designed summer assignments may argue that advanced placement (AP) classes require students to learn from textbooks without the guidance of a teacher so students do not need teacher guidance. But when taking a look at the students in these AP classes, on average students in AP classes struggle and receive poor grades in these classes. This is due to the lack of teacher leadership in these classes. Students in AP classes do not get enough guidance to fully understand the curriculum.\n \n Summer assignments should be teacher-designed because teachers have more knowledge on the course curriculum and students need teacher guidance while learning new concepts. Summer assignments would be more effective if the teachers created the assignments themselves. Summer assignments that effectively teach students the curriculum over summer break will help benefit the students during the school year.",

    Essay: "Every year when summer comes around, teachers are handing out projects to do over the three short months students are given. It's exhausting to the students; they've just been through almost a year of instruction and following directions. There needs to be a break from traditional education, but the answer isn't as simple as just eliminating summer projects. If a school requires a summer project, it needs to be student directed with very minimal guidelines, and give the students a chance to breathe free of the weight of a teacher's rules of fair-play. Traditional teacher-led projects stunt the readers growth, force students to work for a rubric, and overall numb the experience of education.\n \n Teachers are limiting their students with their inability to provide any meaningful work. Take for example the prompt for this essay. It is a shallow, somewhat ambiguous question that was designed with the sole purpose of assessing a student's ability to write. Teachers simply aren't trying to provide meaningful work, or they don't actually know how to. Regardless, giving students free range to do as they please on a summer project will eliminate the guessing game. Instead of teachers trying to accommodate an entire class of kids' interests, students will pursue whatever interests them with a passion. This overall would lead to more growth for the students.\n \n Similarly, giving students the opprotunity to do a student-designed project would eliminate students' tendency to work for a grade. In reality, most students simply do the bare minimum of what they need to do to attain a grade they feel satisfied with. Nobody is going above and beyond the rubric guidelines on a topic they have minimal interest in. This is horrible for students, and it leads to lousy work. It is similar to taking a beautiful maple tree, and cutting it down into a small piece of wood desinged with a simple purpose. Rubrics on teacher-designed projects are holding kids back.\n \n These issues combined make education boring, repetitive and damaging to mental health. Any smart person can look at American education and see it needs reform. An easy way to start it would be allowing the students to design a summer project, and see how much the work improves when students are given freedom. There would be in increase in work output, because it is much easier for kids to work on something that actually interests them. Students will stop doing lackluster work because they will no longer be bored.Â",

Teachers being the ones to design the project can lead to: students having clear standards of what needs to be done, more time managed project, and being stressed out.

Although some may disagree having a teacher designed project over school is more efficient and safe.\n \n Teacher design based projects will be a lotÂ safer for the most part; Moreover, leaving less room for students to say something like not understanding,not enough time, and being stressed out. first thing is not knowing the standards of the project or understanding them. This could lead to a lotÂ of hiccups if this was a student designed project; Consequently stressing the students out. Time management is also crucial due even if a student has an entire summer. letting teachers plan the time it would best to gradually get it done would be great expecting it not to being able to be finish the day before its due. Some students might put it off until they cant any more probably messing up their sleep schedule trying to rush to finish the project Being stressed out is not a great feeling and can ultimately be a reason some students may just give up. Even if it is all planned out a multitude of factors kick in to be able to stress a student.\n \n There are further reasons to letting the project be designed by the teacher. This can help grades if the project is done, can later reward the students by the teacher having faith in the students to do a multitude of other things. These rewards can help students want to finish projects and have a reason to be doing projects on time. Letting a student design his or her own project is a privilege and will ultimately be earned and boosting confidence getting closer to a student designed summer project. One problem for lots of students is that during the summer a lot of things are forgotten. I think having a project made by a teacher can help challenge the brain and keep it ready for when school is about to began. Doing that can improve performance in school on a daily basis.\n \n Although some may disagree, the projects given over summer should be teacher-designed to limit problems.\n \n The summer projects should be teacher designed due to the benefits given to students like limiting time management problems, helping students be ready for the upcoming your and what to look out for. some state that student designed projects wold be better due to less of a workload and boosting moral but this is not the case.

If the student choose their own idea for the projects it's likely they'll do it and not just leave it somewhere to be forgotten.\n \n The projects that the students can choose their own idea is more fitting to them as if having a teacher make a topic that is confusing ,to part of the class but the rest of them understands. At this time too this is a chance to see if what they learned during the school year stayed with them over the summer and shown in their project. When the student does their own idea for the project it pushes him/her to complete it, to use the information he/she learned and put it with their own idea. An example is being given an assignment that you hardly understand and the topic is difficult to write about the student will ask for help and once they go home it will be forgotten. Sometimes when its the students own idea to the projects it gives them a littleÂ encouragement to see it finished and there will be no excuse on not understanding the topic because it was the students own.\n \n The position of projects being students-designed is the better option it lets us know where their going for in a curtain area where they get off topic in their own topic and shows what they can write or do in the teachers terms. This way we can see where the troubles are even though we could do the same on teacher-designed projects on the student based ones the students will get use to writing their own paper instead of someone else's.",

Teacher wants the best for the students so they wouldn't give something out that they know you won't be able to do it.\n \n Therefore, A teacher wouldn;t give out a project without teaching about it first. A teacher would give an example and teach you about the project so it won't be that hard on you anyways. students would know ahead of time if they have an issue with the teaching method or the project itself. It could help parents know what to do and how to help there own child with there project or anything else throughout the year. so i think its a good idea for the student to pay attention in the class when the teacher is explaining it.\n \n Also, when you have a problem or an issue you can always ask the teacher. you can via text or email the teacher whenever you have an issue or a problem with the project. Dont understand the material just email your teacher and she will respond when she is able to. Even if you and someone else has the same problem then you two can work it out. You can contact your teacher and say that multiple people are having the same issues and it'sÂ not only you. If this was a student-designed project then it would be hard and wouldn't know who to ask.\n \n In conclusion, there are many teachers who worry about there student. They think that they will forget everything that they have learned about. It could be possibly true that students can forget what they have learned and so it a good idea to give summer break projects so they can keep refreshing there minds about the topic that they learned about. I feel like the slotions for students to not forget aboout what they learned is summer break projects. These summer projects should be teacher- designed so the projects can be a challenge for the students, the teachers would be able to provide the studentsÂ help when they have a question about the project, it will be easier for the students. teachers should provide a challenge, also will be given a short lesson on what it is on.",

    Essay: "Summer projects help the students learn during the summer and become prepared for the next school year. Although some may say teachers are more experiencedÂ at giving projects because they have been doing it longer; Summer projects should be student-designed, because students will probably not be in that same class with the same teacher next school year, it will be more enjoyed by students, and student are on there break from school and still have to do school work.\n \n First, the students will enjoy the summer project more because the students picked it. The students would also put more work and effort in to the project becauseÂ it can be about someone admired by the student(s) or can be a career choice in the future. Students would be able to do a project on sports, history, engineering, animals, and even health of the human body. There would be interest in the project with that students do not have to do the repeated subject that is in class or a boring assignment the teacher does not care about. When students enjoy a project the subject and possibilities can be limitless and full of imagination.\n \n Secondly, if a teacher gives a summer project to the students nine out of ten of the students will not be in the same class next school year unless the class was an elective class and the students(s) chose to do it again. While having a different teacher next school year the project may or may not be cared for because of the subject difference and the teacher is not worried about what another teacher is teaching. Furthermore, the project may not even be graded by the new teacher so the student should have a project that can related or help them out of the school community. Also the project should be something the student can do without needing teacher assistance in case that the prompt of the project is not clear or the student has trouble finding information on the project.\n \n Last but not the least, during the summer students have a break to relax from all the things students do in school. The students already have to do a project that would be preferred not to do ,so instead of having a teacher design the project having a project that can benefit the students will help them in every day life. Most students take vacations during summer time so having a project that is designed by students can give them ideas on what to do on vacation. The students would have a guide or set up exactly the way the students want it and model the project with out frustration.\n \n In conclusion, If a student is forced to do a teacher designed project the students will be helpless, misled, and extremely bored during the summer. A project made by students can be enjoyed while also educating and preparing the student for the future while having a amazing summer.Â",

    Essay: "Teacher vs. Student-Assigned Summer Projects\n \n Have you ever wondered what it's like having to complete school assignment's over summer break? Chances are, probably not. Many schools are now requiring for summer assignment's to be completed, but the real question is should those assignment'sÂ be teacher-assigned or student-assigned? These assignment's should very well be student-assigned. Letting the student choose their own assignment is a wonderful idea because what they choose is likely something they won't have a hard time completing and they're also still getting some sort of education. Student's can still have fun over the summer while learning and preparing for the upcoming year. A student-designed project could also let the student work on their own time and pace because during the summer most people are out on vacation and don't have time to complete schoolwork. Student-designed summer assignment's would result in a relaxed, but still productive and educational summer that will help better prepare student's in the upcoming school year.\n \n Summer project's should be assigned by teacher's andÂ not student's because of the lack effort the student's will put forth. Having to do schoolwork over the summer is one thing, but making the work student-assigned is whole different ballgame. If the student chose what assignment's they would have to complete over the summer they most likely wouldn't finish it or not even look at it let alone take it out of their book bags. Teacher-assigned assignment's would make the student have to remember what to get done and when to have it done by or there will be consequence's. As a student they may not be fond of it but what it's doing is keeping them learning over the summer and starting them off nicely with solid grades in the upcoming school year. Think about this, during the school year if homework was optional who would do it? Now if a teacher assigned everyone homework and told them to have it done by a certain date for a grade, then see how many student's would complete their homework. It's night and day and the same thing applies in this case.\n \n Put yourself in a young students' shoes, you're in school for nine months and you finally can relax, go home, and just enjoy your time off because you did great during the school year and you deserve it. Then your teacher mentions summer assignment's that will be designed by him or her. The assignment's will likely be a load and it all has to be completed by a certain date. That's just completely unfair, because you work hard all year just to get time to relax and you can't. It's probably very overwhelming and young students need time to take a break and have fun especially after the long nine month slog they call school. Allowing the student to choose their own assignment's over the summer is great because they have no excuse to not get it done. The student would be working on their own time and not on any teachers'. During the summer when people are on vacation and need time off its a great idea to allow student's to get work done, but also have time to do what they desire over break. There's nothing better than working on your own time, having fun, and still getting things accomplished.\n \n The effort given in a teacher-designed assignment versus a student-designed assignment would be completely different. You're likely thinking a student won't do their work if it was up to them and not the teacher, but that's false.\n \n A teacher-assigned-assignment forces their student's to do schoolwork that they're just doing to get done or because they have to, not because they want to learn. In a system like that you dont learn anything and you especially don't have much fun either. Student's should learn to have fun but also want to be eager to want to be educated and want to learn something new. Telling the student's that the summer assignment is due on this day and get it done by this time or it's a zero won't accomplish anything but kid's that just want to get it over with so they won't receive a bad grade. A student-designed project would not only get them more prepared for the year ahead but would also give the kid's time to enjoy their summer and also learn at the same time.\n \n Lastly, student-designed summer assignments would result in a relaxed, but still productive and educational summer that will help better prepare student's in the upcoming school year. Over the summer student's need time to just be kids and hang out, instead of stressing over a teacher-assigned project that is a overwhelming load of schoolwork. Working on your own time and choosing your own assignment is genius because you don't have to worry about anything or anyone else but yourself which would result is more summer assignment's being completed but not just completed but enjoyed being completed. Any teacher can force their kids to complete an assignment, but will the student's really enjoy learning over the summer on their own time compared to being forced to by a teacher. Student-assigned summer projects are the way to go in the future because we will definitely see better results especially going into the following school year.",

For example students learn more when its about something they like because they don't have somebody always telling them what to do and how to do it. This also gives kids the opportunity to be creative, get out of their comfort zone, and to explore new things instead of learning what the teachers want them to learn. This proves that students should be able to come up with the summer projects instead of teacher.\n \n Some people think the teachers should design the projects because teachers know more than students, however they're wrong because that sets a bad example for the students because they're going to think everything is always going to be handed to them and they'll never know how to be independent. For example some kids work and do better when doing something that interestsÂ them which will motivate them to want to keep learning about it; the students also would also get to express themselves through it.\n \n If you think students should be able to do their own projects then you should switch it up here and there so they can do things on there own to show that they're responsible and don't always need a teacher to do everything for them.",

    Essay: "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. The question is should these projects be designed by the teacher or by the student. Normally the teacher designs the projects for the student however, it may be more beneficial if the students design the projects for themselves. There are multiple reasons why the students designing their own projects would be more beneficial, they can choose what they want to learn about, they can use their own creativity, and the teachers can learn more about what the students are interested in.\n \n Firstly, the projects would be much more interesting if the students chose what they wanted to learn about. In other words, they would be way more intrigued and enthusiastic about a topic they like than a topic thats irrelevant to what they care about. Teachers usually give student mundane topics just to keep them occupied for the summer. But now the students can focus on something they care about and will be beneficial to them in life. For example, a teacher may want the students to do a project about the history of Germany but a student who has an interestÂ in becoming a doctor may want to do a project that involves researching the types of doctors that work in the hospital and what they do. See how the project designed by the student is most definitely more beneficial and more oriented towards the students interests.\n \n Furthermore, the students can use this as an opportunity to tap into their own creativity. They now have the chance to create something that represents their own individual interests. The students can actually put their minds into their work and create something new and exciting, which would make them even more eager to learn. The students could work in groups and put their diverse creativity together.\n \n Since the students will most likely design a project about something their interested in the teacher can has the opportunity to also learn something new. Like what their students like to do and would like to be when they grow up. The teacher could also try to measure the creativity of the students and implement a creative curriculum that matches the creativity of the students.

    Essay: "I believe school summer projects should be student-designed. Student-designed projects will help a student express their creativity, it will be less complicated, and it will let them learn about a topic they are interested in. If the project is student-designed, it is most likely for them to keep up with it and not set it aside. Students should be trusted to build something on what they learned on their own.\n \n Even though not all students come up with astonishing ideas, all of them have the capacity to be creative. Creativity is important when it comes to projects. It helps a project look presentable, it also helps the audience gain interest. Students can let their imagination discover more ideas when a project is not teacher-designed because their options are not limited. Not only will it be more exciting to do a project, but it will increase students' grade by showing their creativity.\n \n A student-designed project will relieve stress from students by being able to create whatever they please. Instead of having to assemble something difficult given by a teacher, a student will choose an easier option for themselves, so they will not build up pressure. Since they will most likely pick a non difficultÂ idea, they can complete their project faster. Therefore, students will enjoy their summer break more.\n \n Furthermore, most students will choose an option they are intrigued in, which makes a project become more interesting.Â Students will pick one out of a variety that they enjoy; they will stay on task. For example, the more engaged the students are to their project the more it will help them stay focused.

It will make it more easier for the students to work on and more interesting for the teacher to read. All of the students' creativity and engagement in the project can lead to positive outcomes.

    Essay: "Should summer projects be teacher designed or student designed? In my opinion they should be teacher-designed. Why? you might ask. Well if there teacher-designed you would already know what to do, all you have to do is follow instructions. With a teacher designed project it will also be more put together and less confusion. And you wouldnt have to worry about finding a topic or how should you go about things.\n \n As you know students tend to procrastinate. So if we were to design our own project do you still think we would procrastinate? The answer to that question is yes. If we were to have the opportunity to design our own project we wouldnt have the right mindset. Most students mindset towards a project of their choice is \"oh I already know what I want to do it'll be easy Ill do it a week before school.\" Then a week before school your stressed and trying to throw everything together. And when you get to school you'll blame it on the teachers as if their the ones who told you to wait till last minute. Even though they gave you the opportunity to design your own project, and do it on something you were eager about.\n \n The goal of a summer project is to make sure that students are still getting some type of education during the summer. Teacher designed projects would have more of a lesson to it than a student designed one. There would actually be a reasoning to the project. A student designed project would be more of what they like based project. In order to know that the student is gaining information from the project I feel as if it should be created by the teacher.\n \n Students come back to school from summer break completely clueless of anything they have learned last year. And in order to make sure that this doesnt keep happening each generation teachers have to design a summer project. Notice I said teachers not students. Teachers went to school ,and got their GED or diploma. So they know more than we do so they can insure that we get all the information we need.\n \n In conclusion teachers want the best for students they wouldnt create a project were it isnt benefiting the student. Their job is to educate us and make sure we get the proper information we need. Teachers have sat in school ,and has had years of experience in the education department. Do you think a student would actually put thought into a summer project that would take away from their summer. No they wouldnt I know I wouldnt at least thats why summer projects should be teacher designed.Â",

    Essay: "Over the summer, very few students have the desire to do any homework, especially not a project. In the scenario where a school mandates a summer project, the summer project should be student-designed. Having student-designed projects would make the assignment easier for students to complete and it would also ensure that the students are gaining knowledge from completing the assignment. Assigning a project that isn't grueling and time consuming, as teacher-designed projects tend to be, would result in more students completing the assignment and learning.\n \n Many students never complete projects during the regular school year, and assigning a summer project would seem like an impossible task. However, if the project appealed to students it would be more likely that they would complete it and this could spark a butterfly effect that leads into the next year for those students. It would cause students who don't complete projects or assignments, to turn into consistent, non-procrastinating students. Learning is often made into a very monotonous and dreadful thing but if schools designed learning for students, intelligence would be more spread out across the school. There wouldn't be the groups of \"smart kids\", the groups of \"dumb kids\", or the groups of \"average kids\" and the school, as a whole, would be more successful.\n \n A very typical and repetitive summer project is \"summer reading\". Many schools don't assign this as a mandatory project that is expected to be completed by every student, but is often assigned as a prerequisite to enter high level English classes or to join certain clubs. When the school year begins, a lot of very educated and worthy students are denied the ability to attend that high level class because they haven't completed the summer reading project. Now the logic behind this is, \"If a student can't read one book over the summer, how can they be expected to read multiple books throughout the entire English course ?\". What many people don't take into account, is the fact that regardless of a teenager's intelligence, they will usually neglect all school work until the last minute and end up forgetting. They will either end up not being able to fully put their knowledge to use, or lying about reading in order to enter a class, neither of these outcomes benefit the student.\n \n An argument against these claims would be, \"If teacher-designed projects are assigned, it will be easier for teachers to grade the assignment and this could benefit the student even more by giving them a better grade and better feedback.\". Teacher-designed projects are capable of this, and students would be able to receive more well-rounded, and understood grades if the assignment was being graded based off of a rubric. With a teacher-assigned project, teachers can compare each student's work to past projects that have been completed by other students and accurately determine how good the project is. These types of projects ensure that all students will learn the same amount by eliminating the option for students to do projects about something they are already very educated about in their personal life.\n \n Student-designed projects are more reliable and consistent than teacher-designed projects. They allow students to fully display their intelligence and academic potential. They also allow students to educate themselves about a topic. This leads to better learning habits in the future; and overall, it can turn a good student into an even better student.Â",

    Essay: "In my opinion, the summer project should be a student-designed. I take this certain position on the question because students can explain what they've learned in their own way. I would be easier for the student to do the project of a topic that they are comfortable with. If the student can choose what they want the project to be about then, its a possibility that they would want to do the project more rather than if the teacher was picking it. I also feel that if the student might not be confident in all of the material they have learned, there is a possibility they could have something that they are strong in and they can choose to do their project on that topic.\n \n Don't you want the student to inform you on what they have learned since school ended? This is why I feel this project should be student-designed. I think that if the student chooses what they want their project to be on, the school would see what each individual student has learned truly. If the teacher was to design the same project for each student to do, it wouldn't show how every student has each learned something different. If every studentÂ does a different project or does a different way of doing their project, it would show how much the school cares about what they have learned.\n \n It would also be easier for the student to do the project on a topic they are comfortable with. If a student is confident in certain things, they can do the project on one of those topics. It would be hard to do a project on something that the teacher designed if the student didn't understand it that much. It could've been hard for the student to grasp the concept and if they picked it themselves it would save them the trouble of struggling to do the project. So basically, If you would want the students to do the project, it would be best to let them choose.\n \n Some students do really like the idea of doing projects. I believe if they are able to chose what to do their project on, they would actually do the project. Students tend to not like to do projects that teachers assign them. It could be a possibility that it's because its not interesting enough for them to care. So if you really want the students to do the project, I suggest you let them choose. In fact, you'd never know if you would be intrigued by what each student learned.\n \n In conclusion, my position is that the project should be student-designed. As I am bringing my ideas together it makes since because they want to know what the students have learned, so they should let the students show them. However, if they were to choose teacher-designed, they wouldn't get much feedback of what the students learned, in my opinion. So my position is student-designed. Â Â Â",

She recorded the information thrilled to present her project when school started again. Some schools require students to complete a summer project to assure they continue learning during their break. Although a teacher-designed project could help prepare students for the next school year, summer projects should be student-designed because they can do a project on something that interests them, decide how extravagant they want it to be and they are more likely to do it.\n \n To begin with, students should design their own projects so they can do something that interests them. For example, Generic_Name was extremely interested in robotics. She loved designing different robots that could do many things, such as feeding a baby, turning on a light and drawing. When she heard about the summer project, she decided she wanted to create a robot that could write her name. Generic_Name immediately began planning how it would look, if it would write in cursive and how fast it would write. She spent her summer building, redesigning and perfecting her robot. By the time school started, Generic_Name had built a robot that wrote her name perfectly and got a one hundred on her summer project.\n \n Secondly, students can decide how extravagant they want their project to be. For example, Generic_Name was extremely busy during the summer. She had to go to camp, do the summer musical and marching band thus she did not have much free time to do her project. Generic_Name did not want to do a time consuming project but still wanted an A so she went online to discover how to make bottle rockets. It only took one day to do and she could easily finish it and still have time to do everything she wanted to. However, her friend Generic_Name was not doing anything over the summer. She wanted to do something that would take all summer but would also give her enough time to be with her friends and family. She decided to do an art project that showed the most interesting and oldest parts of her city. She went downtown everyday to paint bridges, buildings, and the view of the city from the roofs of buildings. She was able to show her city's history through her paintings and show her talent.\n \n Lastly, students are more likely to do their projects if they design it. For example, Generic_Name assigned the students a project on the book they were reading. The students did not find the project interesting and most either waited until the night before to do it or did not do the project at all. Most of Generic_Name students failed the assignment or barely passed. However, Generic_Name allowed his students to choose the project that most interested them from a list. They had many different options, such as making a play list, drawing a picture or rewriting the ending. Most of his students were interested in at least one of the options and those who were not could ask him if they could do something that interested them. The students enjoyed working on the project and seeing what their classmates had done.\n \n In conclusion, students should be able to design their own summer projects because they can do a project on something that interests them, decide how extravagant they want it to be and they are more likely to do it. Teachers who let their students choose a project that interests them will have higher project grades than teachers who choose their students projects.Â",

Most of the time, these projects are created by the teachers. Now, some schools are starting to allow the students to choose both the topic of their summer project and the method of completion, as opposed to everyone getting the same assignment from the teacher. Summer projects should be student designed, because students have individual interests, they have their own project styles, and teachers will have less issues to deal with.\n \n Every student in the entire world is different. Everyone has a favorite topic that they like to research or study. Summer vacation is supposed to be a time to relax and take a break from school, so forcing them to research a topic that they do not enjoy takes away from the relaxation of summer. Students would be much happier to research a topic that they personally enjoy. If someone is a big fan of history, they would much rather do a project on the first world war than on biology. The students would also do a better job on the project, because they may already have lots of knowledge on their topic. They would also put more work into the project itself, since it is about something they enjoy.\n \n Similarly, everyone has a prefered method of completing a project. Some would like to record a skit or news report for their project, while others may want to build a scale model. If they are able to choose their project completion method, students will also do a better job on the project, since they will most likely pick a method that they are already experienced at. Someone who studies engineering will be able to build a much better model of a house then someone who studies theater.\n \n Summer projects will also be more enjoyable for teachers. A teacher is usually a student's first resource when it comes to asking questions about an assignment. Teachers will be asked a lot less questions if the students pick topic that they enjoy and have a thorough understanding of. There will also be less lazy or unfinished work for the teachers to sift through at the end of summer, because students will be more motivated to complete the assignment if it is about a topic that they like and a method that they like.\n \n Some may say that teachers need to make summer assignments, because it will lead to a more consistent grading scale, but it will still be easier to grade the projects consistantly if it is all quality work that the student enjoyed completing. Summer projects will be much more enjoyed by the students if they get to pick their own topics and methods of completion, and by the the teachers, because they will have an easier time with assisting and grading students",

The teachers probably wont like that idea very much because its a little extra work but it would be a lotÂ less stressful. Teacher designed projects would be easier because there is less stress for students, teachers would have an easier time grading them, and the teachers would have less work throughout the summer.",

    Essay: "Summer is a part of the year were students and families can take it easy and relax. Their are many things to do over the summer, students generally spend their time at the ; beaches, pools, a relatives house, and even at a summer job. With all of these activites sometimes students forget what they have learned in school. This is a big problem because everything you learn at school builds up on itself and gets more advanced as you continue through the year. Some school countys realized this and decided to take action. Their solution was to assign summer projects so that the students can retain the information they just learned in there current school year. Many students don't like the idea of summer assignments because it takes away from their break from school. If it was teacher-designed students wouldn't be motived to complete it, if it was student-designed students wouldn't learn the right material. That leads us to the question, should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed?\n \n When students are required to do something they aren't particually intrested in, they start to lack motivation or intrest. The same logic can be compared to summer assignments, if the project isn't intresting to students, they probably won't give it a lot of their effort. Which also leaves students to hold it off until the end of the summer. The solution to this problem would be to make the projects student-designed. When you assign yourself with a project you tend to do it with more motivation and more reasoning. This is because when you assign yourself something it is usually done with a reason and you have motivation to complete it.\n \n Some might argue that the project should be teacher-designed because the teacher knows what the students learned and whats best for them, doing so, would help the student retain information important to the teacher, thus setting them up for success next school year. This is a very intresting point and it is understandable to have the teacher explain whats best for them. Though it still doesn't keep the student motivated. As explained before, students work better when they work on assignments designed by them. This helps the student stay motivated to retain the information better rather than putting it off and waiting till the end of summer.\n \n The way the project will work is as follows, the student will be given options by the teacher as to what project ideas are avalible, as chosen by the majority of the class. The student will then be given a way to work on the project, this could be a posterboard, presentation slide show, or a physical demonstration. Then they will have all summer to work on it. When they comeback to school they will be required to present their project to the class. That way the students inform others as well as retain information for the new school year. To motivate to students even more they will be given a grade on how well they do on the project. That way they will be set up for success.\n \n In conclusion, the projects would be more benifital to the students if they were student designed. That way students can retain the information during the summer as well as having a good time over the break. Though others might ague that if the project was teacher-designed it would be more benifital to the student, we fixed that by giving the teachers a say in the project by having them pick out project ideas while the rest of the project was in the hands of the student. All in all the projects should be student-designed to give them motivation and advancement.",

    Essay: "Imagine you are in the middle of a wonderful summer break. When suddenly, you received an email; you opened it, and it happens to be from your teacher. There it is, your summer assignment; after glancing through the rubric document, you let out a big sigh. The requirements and tasks on the rubric were super complex, and it does not interest you whatsoever. You thought to yourself that if this summer project was to be a student-based assignment, then you would enjoy it a lot more. Thus, this lead me to believe that summer projects should be student-designed because it expands students' creativity, give students motivation, and students will have a more likely chance to succeed.\n \n Student-designed projects give students a sense of creativity. Students will be able to express themselves, and show their teacher their fullest potential. Student-designed projects allow students to be more creative through learning by thinking outside of the box. This is because students will have the freedom to go above and beyond their limits, due to the fact that there won't be any certain requirements. Students can also be themselves, and create a final product that meets their teachers' standards. Without realizing it, students can end up creating a masterpiece that they would never have thought they'd be able to create before.\n \n Not only will student-designed projects give students a sense of creativity, but it also give students more motivation. According to\n \n The National Education of Youth Institution , a student stated that he was completely stressed while completing his assignment, which was teacher-designed. Since he did not know what to do for his summer project, this gave him lots of anxiety and stress. This shows that teacher-designed projects will not benefit students, but rather do more harm to the students' health. However with student-based projects, students tend to be more motivated and dedicated to completing their work; as a result, this will provide a positive atmosphere and mindset for students. Motivation is an important concept in learning because it is what strives students to go above and beyond. By having the motivation to complete the assignment, students will have more interest in their activity, and will enjoy it more.\n \n Furthermore, students will have a more likely chance to succeed. Student-based projects will ultimately benefit students because they will be more confident in obtaining a good grade, due to them originally creating the project with their own ideas. A study at Harvard University shows that 86% of students received above an 80%, a B letter grade, on their graded student-designed summer projects. After looking at the statistic, we can conclude that students whom had the opportunity to complete a student-designed assignment, were more likely to succeed and earn a decent grade.\n \n To summarize the totality of the argument, students will have a more beneficial and practical effect when completing a student-designed project rather than a teacher-designed project. Summer assignments should be student-designed because it gives students a sense of creativity, motivate students to do their best, and more students will succeed in the end. Student-designed projects will not only have a big impact on the future of education, but on the students as a whole.Â",

    Essay: "No student enjoys doing schoolwork over the summer, furthermore, if the project required these students to design the project themselves, even less of them would end up completing it. Teacher-designed summer projects are preferable because they require the students to do less work, they're easier to grade for the teacher, and some students don't have the necessary materials at home for a student-designed project.\n \n On summer vacation school is the last thing that is on the minds of the majority of students, therefore, a student-designed summer project isn't ideal. Many of the smaller summer projects, such as simply reading a book, don't get completed despite being relatively easier in comparison to much of the work done during the school year.\n \n A student-designed project would require extra planning and more time devotion that many people wouldn't be willing to give. However, a project of the teachers design would take much less time to complete and the result would be more students actually finishing the assignment.\n \n Every teacher has multiple periods of students to teach. If even only half of the class each period turned in a summer project of their design, it would be a nightmare for the teacher to grade. A grading rubric would be rendered useless because every student turned in their own unique project from the topic of their choosing. This could cause unfairness in the grades given to these students because it would be up to the teacher's potentially biased opinion to decide what grades the projects deserve. If the project was entirely created by the teacher, on the other hand, a uniform grading rubric could be created and ensure that each student recieves a fair grade in accordance with the rubric. This is also beneficial to the students because having a rubric lets them know what they're being graded on and can help them plan out how they're going to complete the assignment.\n \n For the people who don't have wifi or a computer at home, a project they have to design themselves would be a hard task to complete. For starters, students without access to a computer or wifi at home likely aren't going to even know about the project because they were unable to check Google Classroom, Blackboard, or wherever else the project wouldv'e been posted. If they do manage to find out about the project, it would still require the students to go to a public library or a friends house where they can access the internet. This is a hassle that would cause a majority of these students to simply not do the project.\n \n Some people might claim that student-designed projects are better because it allows them to express themselves and their interests through their projects. Sadly, this is invalid because no students truly express themselves through a school project. They do it through things they love like sports, clothes, music, and art. Therefore, there isn't any point in allowing the students to design the project themselves.\n \n A student-desinged project is inferior to one of the teachers design because it takes a larger time commitment, is harder for the teacher to grade, and requires materials that not every student has access to. In conclusion, a summer project is going to be boring to complete anyways, so it may as well be easier for the students and the teacher and not require the students to do more work.",

    Essay: "Do you believe projects in the summer be teacher designed or studentÂ designed? Well from my point of view, as a junior at Generic_School. I feel like all summer projects should be designedÂ by a teacher if you wanna boost their learning through the break. One way you can prove that is, when a teacher may teach you information that you never heard of before. Unlike having to something you already know.\n \n First for instance, if your teacher gives you a project it can be beneficial many ways. You may be learning something that you haven't learned before, and could be learning it in one of your subjects when you get back to school, so when you learn about that topic in a period you would be ready, cause you was provided with information you learned during the summer that teacher taught you. Also, some students prefer being given directional instructions while during an assignment. It helps them because everything is there for them because the teacher them with instructions to complete the project.\n \n However, they're some ways kids benefit from having their own designed project. This includes,kids or teens may not have financial they need for the projects teachers instruct them during the summer.\n \n Also, when they come back to school during the summer they can teach one another something new during things like presentations and etc. Another reason why student should design their summer project, is because students may not feel confront ableÂ with the project the teacher assigned them, and are more likely to do better with something they already know.\n \n So through all these details, what do you believe should students design their own projects during the summer or should the teachers design them. Like said teachers provide some students with information they never heard or ever learned. And you may be informed with information you may be leaning in the next school year.",

    Essay: "Should students design a summer project for school? Yes students should design the summer project. Plenty of students would get their projects done; it'll be better understanding and easier on the students. I believe the summer project should be designed by the students because the students are going to be able to choose what is going to helped them over the break with their summer projects like making it fun to do maybe with friends, family members, or anything to get your summer projects done.\n \n More students would turn in the summer projects. From school experiences when students come back from their summer break plenty of students don't have their summer projects because students don't like the books they have to choose from. The project should be fun for students its their summer break it should be fun and about things they like and turn it an essay about what they did over the summer. The summer project should be designed by students so more students could turn in their projects when they arrive back to school from their break.\n \n Students would be interested in doing them if they were designed by the students. If the project would be student designed it would be much easier for students because the student will have to find something that interested in and what they like and also it would make it much better because the students would have to talk about a couple things that helped them with doing the summer project. Summer projects should be a little fun, better than the way a teacher would design the summer project. Students could make it creative and fun it doesn't have to be boring. Students like to do fun things with school not always just doing work that's boring.\n \n It would help if getting a couple students from different grade levels to talk about the summer project. The students would talk about what is going to be needed for the project. Students are going to agree and disagree about what they dont like about the way the teacher designed the summer projects and turn it into somethings students like and an easier and fun way for students to do their summer projects. Getting experiences from other students on what they like and don't about the teacher way of designing the project is helpful, so the students know what they should be looking for when designing the project for students.\n \n I believe that the students should design the summer project in a fun and creative way instead of reading books and telling things about the book, therefore more students can get them done. I could see why it should be teacher designed because teachers know exactly what their looking towards when trying to help students see their problems in certain areas, but students understand things more when it's coming from experience.Â",

    Essay: "Doing projects over the summer can be a hassle and most of the time student dont want to do the work. Most of the time the teacher gives everyone a project to do ,designed by her, but what if instead the were student-designed. This would encourage students to do their work, let them make their own decisions, and showed their teacher what they really know and shows how creative they are .\n \n When someone tells kids to do something most of the time they dont really wanna do it,especially when it comes to school work when they are out of school. But letting students design their own projects encourages them to want to do it more because it's their own idea. This will make it easier for the student to complete their project because it is something they enjoy talking about .When they are having fun doing the project thats when things are done the best.\n \n When making your own decisions you can make a plan for how you want it done and what you are going to do for it. This promotes students making their own decisions on what they want their project to be about and how they will design it. It also, help students in early decision making with what the topic will be on and how they can put the most information in the project. Also ,if they have more then one idea they have to decide which is the best to do it on. They also have the decision of when they want to do it during the summer and a guessÂ of how long it will take them.\n \n If student designed projects it would let them be creative and show their true potential. Student would have to show their creativity while designing what it will look like and how they want it to be presenting it after summer is over. They will have to show their creativity with how neat and the colors they use. Also, staying on topic with the theme and not getting distracted in other things. This will also show how hard they worked on it and the effort put in it.\n \n In conclusion students should be allowed to design their project for over the summer because it will encourage them to do their work, help them with decision making, and let them be creative. This will help on independence as well as many other life skills they may need in the future. Choosing their projects are just the beginning of a long life of decision making.",

    Essay: "As I sit in a room surrounded by other teenagers, I contemplate the effectiveness of summer projects designed by these students. Most of them would create a meaningless project that took minimal time to create, and even less to complete. And although many student projects would probably be more fun than ones created by a teacher, they would miss the purpose of summer projects- to prepare the student for the coming year's courses.\n \n The majority of students do not enjoy having summer projects. Because of this, if students were allowed to design their own projects for the summer, they would create easy projects for themselves in order to complete as little work as possible over the summer. While most students would be happier doing a student-designed project, few would actually be willing to put in the time and effort to design a good project, leading to a summer filled with pointless work that fails to stimulate the student's mind and prepare them for their classes in the fall.\n \n A major problem with student-designed projects is the students' lack of knowledge about the coursework they will be studying in the next year. Although a student project may be fun, it is unlikely to adequately prepare the students for their classes. The purpose of summer projects are to prepare the student for the next year's work; the teacher knows what will be studied and is therefore better able to prepare material for the summer. Teachers are also more aware of how much time it takes for students to complete a project and therefore will create a project better suited for the time over the summer.\n \n Teachers are expected to create quality projects for their students to complete, which are not full of busy work with no real meaning. Because teachers are both paid to design and teach curriculum to students, and enjoy the subject they teach, they are more likely to put time and effort into creating a meaningful summer project. Students, on the other hand, often do not share the teacher's passion for their subject, and have no motive for designing a good project. If a student's passion is math, but they have been told to design a summer project to prepare for the next year's English class, they are less likely to spend time on the project, because they do not enjoy it and have no interest in pursuing a career in English.\n \n If students were to design their own summer projects, this would mean that each year there would be new projects. New projects each year would create non-uniform summer learning, meaning that each year of students would enter their new classes with widely varying knowledge from the summer. This ends up being harder on the teacher, who has no way of knowing if the students are prepared to begin class, and may cut into learning time if the teacher is required to review what was supposed to have been learned over the summer because the students did not adequately cover the material for the summer when they designed their projects.\n \n The best option for creating summer projects is to have the teachers design projects for their incoming students to complete the summer prior to taking the teacher's class. Although student projects would be fun and easy, they miss the point of doing summer projects and would end up as extra busy-work for students to complete, rather than a meaningful assignment meant to prepare them for the year ahead.

    Essay: "Summer is a time that both students and teachers tend to enjoy. It gives the students a chance to relax, and not worry about things such as homework, projects, quizzes, and tests. The teachers also get a chance to take a break from grading and assigning work. Yet, if students still had to do a summer project in order to keep learning over the summer, it should be student-designed because students tend to be busier over the summer with many different things, and the project should cater to their schedule.\n \n During the school year, most students are very busy with school work, along with different activities such as jobs, sports, and school clubs. For the most students, summer is the only opportunity that they have to relax, or spend time with family and friends. Vacations and family events are usually panned to take place during the summer. And a school project could interfere with that precious time. The student should be the one to design the project in order for it to be flexible to their schedule.\n \n Students designing their on projects would also be a great opportunity for teachers to get a break. Many teachers tend to spend hours on end coming up with lesson plans and grading work. Although teachers would still have to grade the project, the student would be taking a small work load off of the teacher by designing the summer project themselves, And, it could possibly educate the teacher on a different subject.\n \n Giving students the benefit of designing the summer project could also let them be more creative =, and enjoy the task at hand. Most of the time when students have to do projects, it is based off of a subject that is being taught in school: Such as math, history, and science. Letting students be more creative could also allow them to integrate their summer project into their summer schedule. Such as calculating the total amount of hours they have worked, doing historic research on the family vacation spot, or counting how many steps was taken during a hike.\n \n Some may argue that students would not be responsible enough to plan and execute the summer project. Though, there are students who do not do the appropriate amount of work throughout the school year, many students already handle great responsibilities in their life; such as babysitting a younger sibling, sports practices, and having a job to not only support themselves, but their families too.\n \n As previously stated, summer is usually an important time for both students and teachers. Rather they use it to participate in activities, or family events. Or, relax and take a break from school and work. At the end of the day, a student's education is important to maintain. But, so is their time and schedules. That is why students should be the ones to design their own summer project. Along with the fact that it would lighten up a teachers work load so they as well could enjoy their time off.",

    Essay: "Should schools require students to do summer projects? Well I agree with this topic because, some students would want to require better learning experiences that would help them figure out ideas in the future to come; but instead of letting teachers decide we as students should be able to come up with ideas that would fit in with our learning pace. As students we would have more time to figure out everything we need in order to make a good project. Student decisions is made for a summer project.\n \n As students we can talk about what we have learned in class or even at home. Making a project about nature is something you can create for your science class next school year. We would be able to show off our skills as a team in order to let the true leadership come out of everyone. We should be able to partner up with someone that is determined to learn. Doing a summer project on something you done in class would help the most because mainly we already know what we have worked on; but instead of copying basically what you know you be creative. Working as a team isnt easy or hard it will come to you if only we put our minds into it.\n \n Some schools have teachers that want students to better themselves for a purpose. Teachers are settings students up for if there going to college. College isnt made for everyone, some colleges give projects that have to be turned in at a certain point of time. Like writing essays or doing group activity projects. While your in school teachers want you to better yourselves to be someone that you want to be in life. You dont necessarily have to have an poster project, teachers can give you projects that doesnt deal with school it'll just better our community. Projects arent always on paper it can be something else if you or the teacher ant it to be.\n \n Being able to learn during a summer break is hard, because we as children would probably have something to do, like family trips, field trips, and etc.. But if learning is something that is accomplished on its own. We can come up with projects on our own, we can be out of state and take pictures of something that fascinates us and than we could put it on a poster, or even a presentation. Being able to come to school from summer break starting a whole new year, you could talk about the amazing things you saw in a sideshow. Not knowing that we are doing a project basically everyday, it's basically life. Projects can come in many forms, but being able to do them as a team would make it more fun for school and the summer.\n \n While teachers teach and students learn, students should be able to learn on there own at some point. Teacher dont always have to give us work on there topic we should be able to come up with some good ideas that'll be creative in the learning environment.

    Essay: "Have you ever had an project over the summer, and you thought what If this was student designed ? Well I defer, I truly believe that if summer projects were ran by students it will be a major mishap. There are many reasons why summer projects should not be students designed. First, because many students are not going to forget about the academic part of the project. Also many students will not set an time frame on when and how to complete these projects. Then students would not know what strategiesÂ to remember or to use to study over their summer break. For example over the summer I had to read the maximum of six books over the summer, but I could never finish or complete my goal because I would most likely forget about reading over the summer, and I would forget what strategies to use to help me complete my goal. Finally, this why I'm siding with all projects should be teacher designed.\n \n To begin, many students believe that summer break is not to really focus on the time frame that they have to learn or set their minds on nothing pertaining to school work or anything work academic. This is an reason why projects should not be designed by students, and I feel that teachers are going to give students strategies that pertain to what the students have learned during school hours. Also I know that teachers will give students an time frame that will allow students to complete projects, and help students focus on learning during break. I learned that many reasons why I could not complete my math goal during the summer. This was because I was not setting an time frame for myself to keep track and making sure I can reach my goal, also I would very so often forget my strategies that i used during school hours to help guide me. Next, this is why projects should be designed by teachers. I know that teachers would give us many things that will help us remember, and focus such as: notes work assignments that we have done during school hours, and also an time frame of when It can be completed.\n \n Next, teachers providing projects I felt It would be more easier on students because students need an extra boost over the summer mainly most students would feel that they might not remember, or cant retain the information and can not complete. If teachers where to design projects for students,I know that teachers will have an due date on when and how to turn in your projects on time. This suggestion is really good for students, because If students made projects that they wouldn't know how to turn in projects, or when to finish them. My teacher makes sure her students are completing and finishing projects on this website called Schoolagly. This process is to make sure that any projects or work assignments are turned in and done correctly, And also with this process teachers can add notes and definitions that will help with projects and work assignments. To become more perplexÂ on this topic this is the reason why students should not design summer projects,and because sometimes student wouldn't know when to complete or finish these projects.\n \n Finally, there are many reasons to why summer projects should be made by teachers and not students. These reasons are based on the needs for students, and how some students need an teachers to help them concentrate on projects during the summer. Also so students need help from teachers to manage time frame on when to complete projects. Then students might need help from teachers on how to retain the information learned during school hours. But if it were up to most students they would look at it in a different perspective a lotÂ of time students would want to design projects, because they believe that they have all of their materials that they will need for projects and sometimes they don't which makes it hard. Also this makes it complicated for students to make and time frame on when to finish the project,also some may need assistance with remembering what strategies they used to remember during school hours. To sum It up, I truly believe this is why teachers should make all summer projects to give students an helpful pathÂ to continue learning.\n \n In conclusion, there are many reason why students should not design break projects. Many students are going to forget about the academic part of the projects. Also many students will not set an time frame on when and how to complete these projects. Then students would not know what strategiesÂ to remember or to use to study over the break. This concept is really important,and also helps make sure students using the break time for projects,and has an adult that has put material down to help along the way. Teachers creating projects will also help by not letting the students to get off course during break. Just think about it would you want your students, or child to have projects over the break and not have to proper structure for thier projects?",

    Essay: "Some schools do require students to do projects over summer break, however i do think they should be student-designed. The students should design a project that they would be interested to do, but the teacher would have to revise the project to make sure its a project involving school. Also the teacher can see work that the students picked and chose to do, and the teacher could learn more about that student.\n \n The students project should be about something that interests them in their life. The teacher would still make sure its an appropriate topic to do, but for the most part the student should pick and choose what he or she will do. I remember in elementary school my teacher assigned a summer project called, \"All about me\". Even though she picked the topic to the project me and the rest of the students had to really put together the project because it was a personal project that was about ourselves. It was a fun project to do for the most part. I got to put all of my work on a poster board; i talked about my favorite hobby, sport, and color. I also talked about how many sibings i have and their names and ages. It was a good project to do over the summer because it wasn't too overwelming.\n \n A student-designed project lets the teacher know more about that person an how he or she does their work. Students would most likely pick a topic on something easy, but i dont think thats a issue. The students should pick something that they dont have to sit down and think too hard about. It's summer time they dont want to sit down to do a school project during the summer and have to stress about how they dont know how to do it and they just end up not doing it because it was too hard and overwelming. Everyone knows when they get frustrated when their doing something important they just want to give up because they feel like it wont be good enough. Thats how i feel when a teacher gives me work to do and i find it difficult and not interesting i just wanna give up and not do it.\n \n When students are on their summer break mostly everyone goes out of town or their working, so they dont really have a lot of time on their hands. The teacher should atleast let their students do the project in however form they want too as long as they complete the task, i dont think they should be counted out for how little the project is when its completed. As long as the student has all the right points on his or her project they should get a completion grade for even starting it over the summer break; the time where everyone should be relaxing and just having a good time, not doing a school project in the middle of summer break. Like who wants to be out at a resort somewhere for vacation and all of a sudden you remember you have a project that is a lot of points due right when you come back from break ,like thats a lot of stress. It would be so much easier to do a project you picked yourself because you would already know what your gonna put down on your project. You wouldnt have to think so hard on one task.\n \n All the schools that assign summer projects they should let the students pick and choose what they want to do it on, so they wont be stressed out when their supposed to be relaxing on their break from school. Students should want to do the project because its a easy grade and they know exactly what they will talk about. Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â",

    Essay: "Summer break from schools has been a topic of consideration for a long time. Many people do not appreciate a summer break because they forget school material too easily throughout those few months of no school. Others say the break is beneficial due to the fact that students' minds are given a while to rest. Some schools have been combating the loss of knowledge over the summer by giving mandatory projects for students to complete over the summer. By doing this, they are assuring that the students do not forget too much and are still able to function well at the beginning of the next school year. The issue comes in on the differing ideas that these summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. In the schools that require summer projects, the projects should be student-designed.\n \n Schools have given summer breaks with the means of giving both teachers and students a rest. But due to such a large gap in between classes, students have often been observed to forget many things and therefore need lots of review at the beginning of school, which takes up lots of needed class time. If we spend lots of time reviewing at the beginning of each school year, the date for the end of school gets pushed farther into summer, therefore decreasing the amount of break. If students are given projects to design and complete over the summer, they will remember much more. Allowing students to design a project themselves gets them more involved with the material, thus causing them to learn more efficiently than in the classroom. When they are independent and outside of school, the willingness to complete a project would improve quite a bit, even if it is over their break. The end result of this would be that there would be less time taken up to review at the beginning of school, and new material would be presented much sooner, leading to an earlier end date for school, and, obviously, and longer summer break.\n \n With a mandatory summer project that is teacher-designed, the teacher gets even less of a break. Instead of looking forward to the end of school and a nice, long break from the patience-draining teenagers, they have to worry about creating projects for all their students. Since they are already so tremendously busy, heaping yet another material requirement on their head would be unfair. They already do so much more work than the students, so why not make the students create their own projects? Many of my teachers have talked about how over breaks (like winter and spring break) they did lots of grading and planning for when school starts back up. Seeing as how winter and spring breaks would be the only good times to work on a summer project, they would have to be designing a project on top of grading and planning. Consequently, the teachers become more stressed and burdened, all the while not receiving an increase in their salary. Student-designed projects would allow teachers to not be as stressed, and allow them to have more of a break than they otherwise would.\n \n Personally, I would enjoy having to design my own project for summer break. It would give me something more to do, and if it's designed by me, I would find it vastly more enjoyable than one created by the teacher. In my experience, I have quickly forgotten lots of school material in the span of summer break. Summer break is already a time in my life where I hardly do anything except a couple vacations and lounging around at home. If I had to design my project, my brain would be up and running and I would be finding much more to do. Instead of being sedentary, I could be furthering my knowledge in certain subjects so that I feel more prepared for the following school year. My imagination could also run more free than it normally does. Having to create something ourselves allows our minds to be more free and imaginative. Deep down, imagination is something we all crave, but it is suppressed quite often by requirements and rubrics. Minds young and old long to be free and not confined to what we are told we have to do or should do. Making us students design our own summer projects gives our minds wings and something to do.\n \n A summer project is a good idea, but whether or not it should be designed by the student or by the teacher is still under thought. The benefits of having student-designed projects far outweigh those of having teacher-designed projects. Letting students make their own project allows them to increase their consumption of knowledge of different subjects because they are not sitting in a classroom and being talked to by a teacher. They can do what they want with that subject, making it more enjoyable for them and allowing them to remember more, thus decreasing the need to review for a couple of weeks at the beginning of every school year. Another benefit is that teachers would not have to be worked even more. They are already worked hard for so little pay, so they should not have to worry about creating even more material for students. A student-designed project allows the freedom of imagination. Schools preach the idea that they want students to be free of mind, yet they still have a multitude of confines. Many of us also do not do much during summer break, and if we are able to create something that we would enjoy completing, we would be quite a bit more occupied during the summer. We would be excited to go back to school and share what we learned or did over the summer. For these reasons, student-designed summer projects would be a much more beneficial and accepted form of education over the break.",

    Essay: "School summer projects is the thing that students most dread in the summer, apart from summer school of course. Most of the time they are big, boring packets filled with long and boring questions. Usually everyone waits until last minute to complete them because thinking about them during vacation ruins the fun. But with student design projects everythingÂ would be different. School summer projects should be student designed instead of teacher designed. It would help the students get interested in the projects and topics they are about to learn, it would help the teachers better cater to their students in their lessons and it would also help the students explore their creativity and critical thinking in school related assignments.\n \n A teacher's school summer projects is usually just a very thick packet with a lot of questions and a lot of work, they are no fun at all and students dread getting them. Most of the time this projects are not even projects, they're very thick packets with the words 'summer project' at the top in big bold letters.\n \n With students being able to create their own student projects they can cater to themselves this allows them to design the project around something they did during their summer vacation or about an experience they had. These projects should be about using creativity to design something fun that involves what the students are learning and what they're experiencing in the real world. Most of the summer projects are assigned for their class courses for their upcoming school year. Having something that relates their summer vacations and their classes makes the students exited about their courses and all that they can do with it. It demonstrates to the students what they can do in real life with what they are learning at school. Since the students don't know what their summer project is they are going to be thinking about it their whole summer, when they do something they are going to be thinking about how it relates to that subject and if that can be their project. With students learning at different in different ways this allows them to demonstrate what their way of learning is and whatÂ they are most comfortable with. for example for visual learners it could be a poster with big picture and little to none words, for someone who doesnt not learn with drawings it could be a question and answer type project. Student led projects allow students to design their own project is the best way to capture theirÂ attention and make them exited about school.\n \n Allowing students to create their own project would not only be beneficial to the students but also to the teachers. When looking at the projects it allows the teachers to get to know the students, as in every project there will be a part of the students in them. Even though teachers try to it's hard to relate to all of their students. Student designed projects allows the teachers to learn about what type of learners their students are, whether they are visual learners or something else it teaches them about how they can better reach their students and not loose their interest during the school year. This will also help the teachers when making their student plans, when they look at the project they will be able to see what part of the course the students are most exited about learning, what part they have already mastered and what part what part the student seem more confused about. With this information teachers can better creates their teaching plans and better cater to their students and their needs. When making teaching plans it is very important to mold it to the individual because not everyone learns the same way, and this project will help. Catering to each students learning pace and design helps them learn and be successful in their test and their futureÂ in those classes.\n \n Permitting the students to deign their own projects also helps with creativity. In school everything is very structures, it help the students function better and have a more organized school, which is good. Having said this, having structure does not allow students to explore their creativity and their critical thinking all in one, with school related assignments. Creativity is a veryÂ important part of learning and if students are not allowed to express themselves once in a while they get bored and loose interest in the subject or in school all together. When students are allowed to design their own project they are able to explore their creativity in school assignments. Allowing them to design their own project allows them to express themselves in a way where critical thinking is essential to completing the task. Creativity and critical thinking are essential pieces to be successful in the real world and in professional settings.\n \n When giving summer assignment teachers are expecting student to have fun and to keep learning during their summer vacation, but are students expected to have fun doing the assignments if teachers dont put anything fun in them. When assignments are not fun students loose interest and don't want to even think about completing the assignment. Students should be able to create their own assignment. Having student designed summer assignmentsÂ would be beneficial to students and teachers. It would help o the students explore a new way of thinking about assignments, it would also help them explore their creativityÂ and critical thinking all together, and it would also help teachers when planning their lessons to help find the best way for students to learn.Â",

    Essay: "Imagine having to do a summer project over a topic you don't like. Some schools have decided to do this with their students in order for them to still learn while they are on summer break. Although the teacher can make sure you have a topic that you have learned about, the students should design the project. The project should be student designed because they can chose how they want to do the project, they don't have to worry about not knowing the topics, and can be a topic that they like or enjoy.\n \n Firstly, the students can chose how they want to do their project. For example, they could chose how they would want to present their project. Either by choosing to have a report or a presentation to show the class. Another example is they might want to have a group project. The more hands they have the more creative they can make the assignment. Both of these examples show that choosing how they do their project helps them feel comfortable.\n \n Next, they wouldn't have to worry about not knowing the topic if they get to chose. For example, if their picking topics they would chose one that they remember. The students wouldn't pick a topic they didn't understand or remember for their assignment. Another example is that they could pick one that fascinates them. Like for a science project they could pick a marine wildlife topic, if thats what they find entertaining, or for English class they could pick one of their favorite authors or books. These examples represent the fact that if they were to pick their topics it will allow them to be engrossed with it.\n \n Lastly, this project could be something they like or enjoy. Like in my first example having a group project can make it more enjoyable. Because their in a group they could have friends working alongside them making it more fun. This project is where they might be able to let their creative side take control. Students would want the work to be colorful and interesting. Both having friends and being creative let the kids have a fun and enjoyable time doing their project.\n \n In conclusion, the students should design their own summer project because they can chose how they want to do the project, don't have to worry about not knowing the project, and can be something they like or enjoy. Would you let your teacher design your project?",

    Essay: "Assigned schoolwork during summer break has been a widely debated matter for years. For both supporters and opposers of schoolwork being assigned during summer break begs a crucial question: Should summer projects be student-designed or teacher-designed? Although assumptions may lead many to state that teachers, who hold the experience, should deisgn these projects, it is more beneficial for students to design the projects themselves. There are many misconceptions regarding the mentality and intuition of students; it is very likely that student-designed projects can prepare them for large programs and/or assignments, such as the Personal Project. In addition, it may also relieve teachers of excess work.\n \n An increasingly common assumption is that pscyhological intuition, and creativity in some aspects, increases with age, thus students are less capable of designing a project, or most things for that matter, than adults. Several people argue that students may lack maturity, but various pscyhologists, notably Generic_Name, have disproved the claim, finding no evidence of maturity being linked to one's intuition or strive of creativity. In fact, this myth actually arose due to various reforms of the Progressive Era restricting children and immigrants' personal freedom, which continues to this day. Although many would deem this irrelevant, it is precisely the reason that we must not hold back to provide students with freedom in creating their own projects and avoid persisting a key issue.\n \n Adding to that, and perhaps one of the most common arguments against teacher-designed projects, is the statement that students are not exposed to projects that require overarching critical thinking. Research conducted by various universities, such as the University of Chicago, has shown that students are not prepared for upcoming projects every time they complete a teacher-designed project; for example, a student completing a project that provides them with a template, deadline, and requirements may not actually affect them to the extent that many people assume, as the student simply searches for information rather than being properly invested and analyzing the information they have, as they would be much more likely of doing in a student-designed project. This is not simple speculation; counties in New York and Massachusetts, even with their massive demographic, cultural, and ideological differences, have both reported increased success in student-led projects after beginning their student-designed summer projects curriculum.\n \n Despite the aforementioned standpoints, there is no doubt that teachers are very important figures in society, and they should never be taken for granted and must be treated with absolute respect. Unfortunately, a large domestic issue in the United States is the amount of appeal of having a teacher career. Unlike in countries such as South Korea, American citizens stereotype teaching with negative assumptions/statements. Although that is another discussion in itself, it still has a strong tie to teachers being overworked, in some regions more than others, but it should not be downplayed nontheless. In many states. summer break is one of the only periods of time that teachers can be truly relieved of work, and that time should be maximized by reducing their tasks; if there is going to be schoolwork done during the summer, it is at the very least a moral ideal to relieve teachers of doing unnecessary work that could be easily handed to students.\n \n Simply put, very few communities should expect to carry out teacher-designed summer projects with pleasing results. As promising as it may seem, it is apparent that teachers should not be given excess loads of responsibility of their students, and it is time to allow the students to take their own approaches to their tasks and prepare them for what is to come. It is not a perfect idea, as no idea can be, but everyone must take steps to reach their end, even if it is gradual. If we are to see to the success of more students and further cememt the well-being of our educators, this is a crucial step that should be taken.Â  Â Â Â",

    Essay: "Some schools require students to complete summer projects during their break to assure that they are continuing to learn even when they are not in school. It is debated whether or not these projects should be student designed or teacher designed, and I believe that summer projects should be student designed. Students may want to design their project about something that they are passionate about, something they wish to learn more about, and perhaps they may be more accepting of doing summer projects if they got to design the projects they complete. It is hard for teachers to plan and design projects for each individual student because he or she may not choose a project that the student would want to complete and then a negative attitude develops towards summer projects. It is important for students to continue their education throughout the summer break but it needs to be something that they are interested in and something that they wish to learn about. Teachers get to plan all of their activities and projects throughout the school year and students have no say about what they wish to learn about or a project they wish to complete. Summer projects are the perfect opportunity to allow the student to choose a project that is interesting to them and that they have a passion for.\n \n If students were allowed to design their summer projects, they woud be more passionate towards it and be excited to complete it. Most summer projects that teachers design for students lack adventure and are the same boring projects they receive during school. Teachers design projects for their students all school year long and students do not wish to continue doing those same boring projects during the summer. If a student was able to design his or her project they would design it based on their interests and something that they are passionate about and that would result in an amazing project that shows heart and passion. A teacher rarely is going to plan a project that applies to each student's interest and instead just plans a project that is mundane that no student wishes to complete. Perhaps a student was passionate about art, they could easily take a trip to an art museum and design a poster or a slideshow about what they experienced at the art museum and then share their passion with other students in the classroom. Learning does not always have to be completing work in a textbook or doing a book report, it can be fun and exciting and something students have a passion for. If students were allowed to choose summer projects, it could result in more students being passionate about learning and some really amazing projects.\n \n A student designed project could be something that the student wishes to learn about as well. If a student showed an interest in marine biology, he or she could take trips to an aquarium and construct a project about what he or she learned. It is difficult for teachers to know all of their students interests and what they would like to learn about and that problem could be solved quickly by letting the students design their project. If a student does not want to learn about the project that a teacher has designed for them, summer projects become a negative thing and no student wishes to complete them. However, if a student designs a project around what he or she would like to learn about, it sparks a level of interest that may not be reached if a teacher were to design the project. Most of the kids in school are learning the basics, math, reading, writing, science, and so forth. While some of these subjects may interest students some may be more interested in the human anatomy, marine life, and the study of different cultures and if a student could design their summer project they could travel and witness different cultures and their history, or travel to a beach or nearby river with countless number of wildlife. They could truly experience it first hand which is a better form of learning than anyone could receive in a classroom.\n \n Also, students may be more open to completing a summer project if they were the ones to design it. Of course it would have to meet guidelines, but at least it would be catered to the student. When I was younger I was assigned summer projects and I dreaded them every year because they were mainly huge, thick packets of math problems. I had no interest in completing these summer projects and eventually I quit doing them. However, if I were able to design my project I would have made it fun and educational at the same time and I would have been more open to completing it. One summer my aunt took my cousins and I to the science museum and we had a wonderful time but we also got to learn a lot as well. I was about eleven years old when I took this trip and I will never forget all of the amazing things I learned as well as how much fun I had. Learning does not have to be strictly confined to completing packets all summer, it can be broader and more fun. If students could design a summer project that suits them and is fun and interesting, they would be more open to completing it.\n \n In conclusion, students should be able to design their summer projects because, there will be more passion towards the project, it could be about something they may not be able to learn about in the classroom, and they would be less negative about completing it. Teachers do not know each and every student's interest or what they wish to learn about so it is difficult for them to design a project that is fun for every student so they end up giving out mundane packets every year. It is important to allow students to choose what they would like to learn about and further their education in during the summer because teachers choose what they learn about during school. It should be their opportunity during the summer to explore the horizon and further their education by doing a project they wish to do and that starts with letting them design their project.",

    Essay: "Some schools have summer projects so students will keep learning during the break. These projects should be student-designed. The one of the reasons for this is because if a student makes them, they will choose something they enjoy and will also enjoy the work. Summer break is a time when your supposed to enjoy your time off so shouldn't the projects you have to do be the same? That being said, let's say... A teacher assigns a ten page essay to do over the break. No one would want to do that. If a student was making the project, they could make it into a fun project of some sorts. Like for example, a project to solar power your iPhone charger. They would still be learning but they could enjoy themselves while doing it. They might even do more projects than required because they are enjoying themselves.\n \n Eventually, you run out of things to and you get bored, designing your own project could be a fun distraction because you're not writing that ten paged essay. Students could learn while making their own project. While making the project, it could help learn important leadership skills, how to make good use of time, how to be independent, and could even help them get closer to their dreams. They are no ends to the possibilities of what kinds of projects. They could be research projects, experiments, keeping a journal and so much more. The student could cater to their interest and goals so they aren't just doing more schoolwork that might not help them achieve their goal or get where they want or need to be.\n \n If they're projects can help students reach their goals, then as teachers, whose jobs are to help students, they should be able to make their own projects. Teachers can even set a minimum of how much they need to do. We don't have to leave it all the to students if your not comfortable with that. The teachers still need to grade those projects. But they should still be student-designed, teachers can just help guide students like their supposed to. Teachers jobs are to guide students and the best way for them to help them is to let them make their own projects. Like it was said before, students can gain new and helpful skills they can use in the workplace.\n \n People have to make projects all the time for their jobs, so why not start early so they can figure out what works for them and what doesn't. It would save them a lot of heartache in the future and that's what we want... To prepare students for the future. That's exactly why I think summer projects should be student-designed.",

    Essay: "Should students create their own summer project instead of teachers assigning them it? Students like to goof off in them summer and could care very little about school. If students did their own projects some of them might be a good project while others students projects looks like they didn't try at all. Teachers should come up with summer projects because it is more organized for the students to do, easier for the teacher to grade, and it motivates every student to try and put in effort in their projects.\n \n Teachers should assign summer projects because it would be more organized. Many students that I know hardly put in any work writing their own essays in school even when they can write about whatever they want to. Some students don't know how to write a essay or how to even come up with the structure of one so how do people expect students to come up with their own personal summer project. Some students, however, are very creative in coming up with certain project ideas and are able to create or finish a essay easily. Not all students are like this. A lotÂ of students need to be told what to do for a project because they aren't that creative in coming up with ideas for projects and need help.\n \n Assigning summer projects by teachers make it easier for them to grade the project. Teachers usually have a hard time grading essays already even when they assign a certain book that the students are suppose to read. It makes their job twice as harder if the students were allowed to make their own project because its all different topics rather then 1 topic. Some teachers are really good though at grading peoples assignments and know some of the facts students projects. Most teachers, however, are not like this at all and they find it easier for them to just assign one topic for the student to make a project about so that it is easier to grade.\n \n Students lack motivation in doing schoolwork, especially projects. Some students that I have meet could care less about projects even if they have the choice to come up with their own ideas. They see projects as a pointless thing because they are already doing bad at school and the feel like its not gonna help their grade so what's the point. Some students are more motivated in trying to get their grades up and if they were able to make their own projects they would feel more motivated to get better grades. However, not all students think the same way and would rather feel more motivated if teachers handed out the topics for projects rather then make their own project.\n \n Summer projects should be assigned by teachers rather then students make their own summer project. It makes everything easier for both the student and the teacher. It also allow students to easily research the topic so that they can enjoy their summer rather then worry about it all summer. Some students would also procrastinate it and wait till the end if they were to make their own summer projects and it wouldn't be as good of a project as if the teacher were to assign the project.",

    Essay: "Some schools believe in summer projects, the purpose of these projects are to assure that students continue to learn during summer break. Classes should be challenged to design their own project, this will challenge the student to design a complex project that is guaranteed to stay a topic of interest. Students should poses a checklist that details what the project needs. Teachers can provide examples for the class to reference if they become puzzled on a part of their task. Upon completion the teacher would receive an email verifying that the student finished the task.\n \n Say if the project is for history the teacher can choose the time period they want and the student will find a topic. For example the teacher wants the project to be in the 2000's, the student could then choose to write about wars in the Middle-East. Therefore the topic is relevant to what the teacher wants and the student is interested in his or her research. The person working on the task can write about why the war happened, who started the war, and when the war ended. After the student finishes, the work will be emailed to the history teacher and would be graded.\n \n If a teacher dictated the project the student would not have much interest in the work. The student would lose interest and stop working on it or would score low on the work. Loss of interest may result in the student not learning anything over summer. If someone holds interest in a subject they will retain the information they researched, and can possible continue to understand and research that object or subject. Which would result in learning something new over summer break.\n \n Some teachers might say why give the student control on the project? Well if a student controlled their work they would be able to let their imagination flow, allowing them to discover their personality and learn about how they think and work best. The student would most likely choose something they want to learn more about. They can also choose something that appeals to their interests. For someone to learn something they must choose what appeals to them and build knowledge through research. That is why a student should be able to choose their summer project and not be told what to do work on.\n \n Some students are required to do school projects over summer. Schools say it benefits the student and expands their knowledge. Schools should let the students choose and design their project. Student choice would assure that they learn something new over summer break.

    Essay: "Summer projects are beneficial in allowing students to continue learning throughout their summer break. By working on a short essay or PowerPoint over this three month span can allow students to achieve their goals in understanding a certain subject better. However, the debate about these projects is if they should be teacher-designed or student-designed. While some may believe that teachers know more about learning than students, I believe that these projects should be student designed in order to make them more enjoyable to the students, help the students individually, and give the students a break from the typical classroom norms.\n \n First, making these summer projects student-designed would make them more enjoyable to the students. Students know what they enjoy doing and what they do not like. At first, summer projects may sound like a hassle for students, but if they design an exciting project, they may be excited to start it and turn it in for grading. For example, when I was in the eighth grade, my English teacher assigned us a long list of vocabulary to do over the summer. My classmates and I were all dreading the 100 vocabulary words that we had to define by ourselves. However, if we were allowed to put our own spin on it and create a PowerPoint or hands-on project, then we may have been more motivated to learn the vocabulary words and retain the information in a more beneficial way.\n \n Also, the students know what subjects they struggle to learn in. Some students have trouble in math or science, while others struggle with reading or history. By allowing the students to create a summer project that focuses directly on a subject that the student knows they need help with would be more beneficial than just a random assignment that the teacher chooses for everyone. For example, I struggle with history, so when I fall behind in class, I ask my teacher for help and he will assign me extra credit work that is based on the topic that I am struggling with. This extra credit benefits me more than just a worksheet or a quiz and I begin to actually understand the topic.\n \n Moreover, these student-designed projects would also give the students a break from the typical classroom norms. During the school year, teachers will assign worksheets or packets of information that is used one time in the class and then never thought of again. They also use tests and quizzes to store information in the students head for a short period of time. By allowing the students to create a project that they would enjoy and is proctored to their specific learning style, could motivate the students to learn and retain the information better than they would in a typical class.\n \n Therefore, the student-designed summer projects are the best solution to keep the kids learning, but also not overwhelm them with work. Allowing the students to create a project that they would throughly enjoy doing is not only beneficial to their learning, but also their attitude towards the school. Creating a project on a particular subject that they know they struggle with could motivate them to do better and help them develop a passion for learning. Also, swaying away from the usual learning styles that are shown in the classroom can also give the students a break while also allowing them to continue learning. Although teachers know what to teach and how to teach, the students have to have a passion for learning before they can retain any information and student-designed summer projects are the best solution.",

The students would have an idea of what they would be learning about the upcoming school year. With this advantage, teachers would use time in the classroom more effectively. This will also cause students to have the thought of school already in their mind.\n \n Another factor to look into when teachers design the summer projects, it would create a challenge for the students. If the students were in charge of designing a project, then they are most likely to pick something that doesn't require a lot of thought. As a teacher, their job is to generate the students' mind. Designing challenging projects would do just that. This would cause students to have the urge to learn more about the project. Also, when they get back to school they would have numerous questions about the project.\n \n Although some may say that if teacher-designed projects are implemented, then the students may not be interested. Simply because of the fact that it is not a topic they particularly want to learn about. While that may be true, ultimately it would be more beneficial the students if the teacher designed them. If the students creates the project, then they could possibly pick a topic that doesn't really benefit them in the future. When the teachers create the project, the students are more likely to get something out of the project.\n \n In closing, teachers should design the summer projects. This decision would benefit the students as whole. It would guarantee that the students are actually learning during the summer. Teachers wouldn't have to worry about students making a project that didn't require a lot of thinking. Also, it would cause teachers to not start a completely fresh lesson when the school year starts. The whole idea of summer projects is to continue learning outside the ten month school year, that can't happen if the students are in charge of the other two months.Â",

    Essay: "I belive that these summer projects should be student designed rather than teacher designed. Students are able to work better if they get to design what their project should be about and have the chance to be more creative, they are also less likey to be stressed about doing it wrong. If these projects are teacher designed, students are limited to what they are capable of doing.\n \n When students get the chance to design and pick what they can learn about for their project, they will most likely pick something that they are pasionate about. Which means that they will most likey have more information about it and have the opportunity to be more creative on the finished product. For example, if a student wanted to to bulid a model about something they like, then they will work as hard as they can to complete it to the best of their abilities. It doesn't matter what topic they choose, all that matters is that they are using their time wisley and learing about something new or learning more about something they already knew.\n \n Having to do a project over the summer in general is stressful enough, so having a teacher get to design the kind of project students should do, would add even more stress. This stress could lead to students wanting to give up on the project and not complete it. Students are excited about summer because it means they won't have the stress of doing work for school, so if you design something that is easy and know a lot about, causes youto get it done quicker and enjoy the rest of your summer worry free.\n \n In my opinion, I think that is would be less stressful if I could get the chance to design my own project. I wouldn't have to worry about holding up to what a teacher expects me to do and only worry about what I know i can do.\n \n Concequently, if these projects are teacher designed, students are limited to what they are capable of doing. It limits their creativity and their work ethic. For instance, if student wanted to create a type of art work about what they learned about, they wouldn't be able to do that if a teacher got to choose the kind of design the student had to do. Students are expected to do their best and succeed, limiting them to do a specific project would only casue them to do the opposite. Students are capable of doing great things if you let them.\n \n In conclusion, students should have the opportunity to design their own project. Letting students design their own projects would only effect them in a positve way. It would cause them to do their very best and improve their creativity. They would be less stressed about doing what a teacher expects and get the project done much quicker. Students would have more time to enjoy their summer worry free. Teacher designed projects would only limit them to what they are actually capable of doing.Â",

    Essay: "I along with other students, hate summer projects especially when a teacher designs it. As you can already tell i'm against teacher designed projects, and hereÂ isÂ why.\n \n When a teacher designs a summer project or any project in that matter it can be very uninteresting, which increases the chance that a student would just forget about the project or put in a low effort. Teachers these days give out more online work than paper, and anything online can be easily forgotten. Due to the fact that its online means that students would have to stay inside and not do what they've planned for the summer. Some students work efficiently if its on paper rather than a computer. What i'm trying to say here is that summer projects should not be designed by teachers.\n \n A big reason why students should be the designers is because that teachers lack something the fresh minds of young students have. That something is creativity, believe it or not creativity can get you far in life and it even makes school work a lot easier and fun. Doing anything in the same old fashioned traditional way can be tiresome and repetitive ,but doing work or anything can be a lot moreÂ enjoyable and easy if you think of a creative way to do it. There is no reason at all a student should not be able to complete a project they designed themselves.\n \n Now I know some people think teacher designed summer projects are more direct and easy to follow this is false because if you make the project you know all the steps and how to follow them.\n \n In conclusion students should be the ones designing summer projects not teachers.",

    Essay: "Summer projects. The way schools assure that students continue learning during break. During summer, students often find themselves forgetting most of the material they had learned the previous year. A way to stop this from happeningÂ is to require students to complete a summer project. Alas, it is difficult to decide if the project should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Summer projects should be student-designed since it promotes creativity, invokes passion, and encourages students to be independent.\n \n A student-designed project promotes the students creativity. Generic_Name found himself wanting to be more creative after he finished his project. Promoting creativity in a project may spread more to a students daily life and strengthen their creativity. Since summer break is so long that the student's creativity could keep building. Generic_Name saw that he was able to solve problems quicker based on how creative he was. This can transfer over to other task the student may need to get done. Along with that it could make the summer project progress quicker than usual. Although a project does require creativity, it also needs some care.\n \n Allowing a student to design a project the way they like it, creates passion. Generic_Name like it when he can choose what he wants to do because he can do something he cares for.\n \n A Student that cares for a project will work on it more and one that dislikes their project. Summer break allows students to have a long amount of time to work on something they love, drastically improving the quality. Generic_Name had more pride in his work because he cared for it.\n \n Caring for the project and finish it can create a pride in the project and in ones self. Also, with the more time someone works on a project the more pride that person can get for finishing it. The benefit of a student-designed project can be good for the short term and long term.\n \n Projects that are student-designed encourages students to be independent. Generic_Name enjoyed his project since it gave him a taste of independence. Getting a sense of independence is good for teens since they are about to become young adults. Along with that, during summer break students can exercise that sense of independence by going out on their own. Generic_Name as so experienced with being independent that he had no problem when he moved out. Practicing independence can help with the future hardships students may face. An example of this is managing college and work. Student-designed projects can help in so many ways.\n \n Although, many feel that students would get off track of what the project is meant to do and not know want to do without structure but, this would just promote the ability to think for their own. Promoting Creativity with student-designed project would increase the creativity of the student it would help problem solving. Passion can be created, where they care and have pride for something, through a student-designed project. A student-designed project can encourage students to be independent, building experience and practice doing so. Just letting the students decide will help them.",

    Essay: "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Should these summer projects be teacher designed or student designed? These summer projects should be teacher designed, because students may want to make simple projects without putting much effort into them. Students may not learn anything from their own projects, because they could just be copying and pasting from the internet. Teachers can also make a list telling the students what is required for the project, making the project more effective.\n \n Making the summer projects teacher designed would be better than making summer projects student designed, because students may want to make simple projects, without putting much effort into the work. For example, if Generic_Name were to work on a project, during his summer break, Generic_Name would probably rush and put random things on his project in order to say that he has done the work, because he may have other priority's, such as going outside and playing a sport or going to the swimming pool. For sure, tons of other students would do the same as Generic_Name. This means that making summer projects student designed wouldn't be the most brilliant idea. Making summer projects teacher designed means, teachers would want to see some fantastic work, instead of some junk that students would do.\n \n Students may not learn anything from their own projects, because they could just be copying and pasting information from the internet. That is plagirism, which is illegal to do and students can get into trouble for that and by the way, students are not learning. Therefore, summer projects being designed by teachers is a great idea, because teachers can assign the students ways to write, instead of copying and pasting, and teachers can make powerpoints of the instructions, that the students must follow. The way students can gain knowledge on what they've done is by reading reliable sites, based on the topics that the teacher has given them and summarizing what they have read and making sure it makes sense.\n \n Teacher's can make list's of the requirements that the students must follow for their projects, making the project spicy. For example, the teacher can require the students to write a certain amount of paragraphs in their own words, joined with pictures that relate to the students work, and even data that the student would have to collect, making students experts that they could even present their work to hundreds of people. This means students would have to put in time and effort to make sure they have learned something during their summer break, instead of just spending time on their phones, playing games, and not doing anything productive. Meaning that the requirements that the teachers give to the students is a huge role on how the students final product is going to look like.\n \n Therefore, schools requiring students to complete summer projects to assure learning during their break, should be teacher designed. This means that the teachers should create the way the summer project should be made. Students should take time out of their summer break to complete a project that is informing and can help them learn more. At last, summer projects should be teacher designed instead of student designed. Â Â Â Â",

    Essay: "Why are summer projects student-designed instead of being teacher-designed? They are designed for students to learn about a specific subject that could teach them about a lot of things that they haven't heard about before doing the project. Student-designed summer projects represents new information, the amount of time it has been worked on, and the possibility of helping the society. Summer projects will help a student during their summer break to keep learning new things in the world and develop facts about them.\n \n Firstly, student-designed summer projects shows new information to students rather than a teacher. A teacher taught themselves to know the knowledge that a student would need in their future life, so making a project would increase the knowledge of a student. Projects during the summer break could actually help a student to remember everything that they learned and teach others about it to where people will learn new things in their life. When a student is able to give people details about what they learned during the summer, it would be added to the brain of the person to know what to do or how to do something. Information given from a student would stay in their mind for a long time to recollect, but a person will try to prove them wrong, so that they will get the point of the argument until the student is able to show the facts that they are the correct individual. Students collect facts of their subject and study them to show to the teacher of how much new information has helped them in knowing something they didn't know before working on the project.\n \n Secondly, student-designed summer projects shows the amount of time the student has been working on making the project. Timing of a project can represent how determined a student wants to learn about a new subject, so they could use all of the facts and put it into their project. If a student is taking days to weeks to finish the project they are going to make a spectacular presentation to the students and the teacher that will give them an extra boost in their knowledge. A student that takes only a day to work on their project wouldn't care about the facts they learn, even though it is important to learn everything that they need to learn to be smarter with facts that could come in their future. It shouldn't take a long time for a student to work on their project and not finish it in time to where they don't have the information, and it will show how irresponsible the student can be of not working on their project.\n \n The project should be filled with real information to where students can use it and transfer it to other students brain as they would have the possibility of taking a test or quiz on the information that was given to them. Testing or taking a quiz on a subject that the student have done a project on should be easy for all the students who learned a new fact.\n \n Thirdly, student-designed summer project helps society to do better and not make it worse to where it will become a deserted area or bad society. A summer project about helping society would influence people to care for their society to always clean it instead of trashing the area making it look dirty that no one wants to come near it and help people, so that nothing bad will happen to their society and no one will make it a bad area. Society creates a place to where Americans can be comfortable around each other having them to express their emotions publicly and getting the attention of people to care about them. It also creates a space to where people wouldn't like it based on the people that lives there having it to be seen as a bad society that no one who wants to live in a good society would consider to live or visit in that area. Americans can help society from becoming a bad society and a deserted area by taking care of the area and citizens who are in need of help before they make the society to be bad. If the society becomes to be not a good society everyone who lived there would leave and decide to live in a bigger area that has a better society.\n \n However, teacher-designed summer project will give the teacher the same information that they already knew before, but a student-designed summer project would actually teach the students new information of their subject during the summer. When a student is doing a project during the summer it would be intriguing to the students to keep learning and show everything they have in their brain to offer to other students improving their knowledge too. Teachers are able to learn the information as they study hard to give the students the same information, so a student should be able to do the same thing and achieve a better grade for their summer project. Student-designed summer projects can show their capability of getting the facts and information of their subject to where they would gain ideas on how to make their project connect to other students mindset on it.\n \n In Conclusion, summer projects are required to be student-designed to help students to learn new information and develop facts in the world. It teaches the students new information, the amount of time the project has to be done, and a way of helping their society to know in their future life. Summer projects are a good requirement for students to learn new things during their summer break.",

    Essay: "Over summer, many students are required to do a project pertaining to a specific class. The projects given, should be teacher-designed rather than the student creating his or her own idea. The project should be teacher-designed because the project gives an outline to the student on what will be taught that school year. It also helps the student determine officially, if he or she would like to stay in that specific class and as well as, express to the teacher on the type of student he or she will be, based on the effort given on the summer project. If teachers continue to design the projects, there will be more success within the classroom and the work ethic given by students.\n \n When teachers give a summer assignment, the work given helps a student see the type of material he or she will be learning that year. The work comes to show how rigorous the class and classwork will be based off of the work load and in depth questions that the teacher has provided. With receiving an outline, it gives the overall idea of what to expect, so that the student can mentally prepare, for the upcoming year. When being able to prepare ahead of time, the student will be able to see the amount of work that might be given. Without the teacher-designed summer project, the student will be oblivious to what to expect in the class that they will be taking.\n \n Continuing on, a teacher-designed project, helps express to the teacher on the type of student he or she will be receiving, based off of the effort given on the project. When a teacher designs a project, it is usually a reflection of how hard that specific class is and type of teacher he or she might happen to be. If the student happens to only complete the bare minimum or does not even try, it shows that, that student may not be best suit in that teacher's class. With the teacher giving a personal designed project, it shows which students have the initiative and will work hard on any assignment given, moving forward. The project overall gives a central idea to the teacher, on what he or she needs to expect during the future of the school year.\n \n Many claim that not letting a student design their own project, takes away from his or her creativity and own personal ideas. However, the point of someone expressing creativity, is being able to take anything and make it their own. A student can still be creative and express themselves through the work given by the teacher. Having the ability to express his or her own ideas and meet the requirements, will stand out to any teacher evaluating it. Just because the range of ideas and creativity is limited when the student is not able to create his or her own project, does not mean creativity or personal ideas are completely shut out and prevented from being intertwined within the teacher's design.\n \n Overall, having a teacher-designed project is more efficient and much more beneficial than one that is student-designed. When having a project designed by a teacher, it is a way for a student to see how hard and rigorous the class will be and the abundance of work that will be given throughout the rest of the school year. Not only that, but it as well gives teachers the overall idea on what will be expected of specific students and the standards that will need to be upheld the upcoming year. Without the teacher-designed projects, the students will not know what to complete a project on and will not be ready at all, for what they will be learning the upcoming year. Teacher-designed projects are a great idea and will be a great addition, for all students to have the ability to be prepared, for the upcoming school year.Â  Â Â Â",

    Essay: "Alright class, you have a summer assignment that you will need to complete by the start of next school year.\"\n \n For many high school students, that quote is often what teachers will say to them at the end of the year.\n \n It is not uncommon for a teacher to give out a summer assignment, especially in math or AP, or Advanced Placement, courses.\n \n These projects can help to prevent loss of knowledge during the summer months, while students are not in school, or even just help the student to warm up their brain.\n \n These projects should be teacher-designed, because student-designed projects will likely not help learning much, it makes grading easier on the teacher, and it helps the students to know what to expect from the class.\n \n Students, just as electricity, will pick the path of least resistance.\n \n That means that students will almost always choose the easiest way to complete an assignment.\n \n That is one of the reasons that students will cheat.\n \n I know a few friends that will cheat on most of their assignments, just because it is often easier than doing the work.\n \n Because of that, the projects that students choose to complete will not be beneficial to their learning.\n \n The student-designed projects would instead be ones that are the easiest to complete, not what benefits learning for the student.\n \n For example, when students are told to make a story using certain elements of their choice, most students will only use those elements that are simplest and nothing more.\n \n Because of that, the students may not get as much experience of writing a story with more complex, yet more beneficial elements.\n \n If students are told to do a summer project, that they have the choice as to what to do, then they will choose what is easiest and not most beneficial to their learning.\n \n If instead a teacher decides the project, then the student will have to use those more beneficial elements.\n \n Also, if the teacher has to make howÂ the students create their projects so complicated, then the teacher might as well just create the project.\n \n Whenever I have to do a project that involves multiple different choices, and the rubric is very vague as a result, I often can not tell if what I have done is an A+ work.\n \n I specifically had to do a project on\n \n The Catcher in the Rye , where I had to choose between multiple choices including an essay or various different visual projects.\n \n The rubric on that wasn't very helpful when I was trying to figure out if I had done an A+ work, because it did not include much specifically about the project that I chose.Â While that might be fine when I already know the teacher, so I can ask them, it would be much harder during the summer to know if it is excellent work.\n \n Because of this, the students would either just not care that much about the project and just do what they think is the bare minimum, or they would be pressed into doing two miles instead of the only one mile needed for the project.\n \n While this may be beneficial to the learning sometimes, it would also create much stress that would hinder the student's learning as well as life.\n \n Along with this, because of the vague rubric, the teacher may have a different idea of what constitutes a good project than the student.\n \n If the project is designed by the teacher and the rubric is more specific, then that discrepancy does not exist.\n \n And then, because the rubric is more specific, the teacher would be able to grade it on more objective rather than subjective elements, meaning that all the teacher would have to do is follow a checklist to grade it, rather than vague guidelines as to what to look for.\n \n This would make teachers lives easier, especially just after getting back from summer break.\n \n Another benefit with the teacher-designed project is that it allows the students to know what to expect from the class.\n \n For example, when I was in AP World History, I had to outline the first three chapters of the textbook as a summer assignment.\n \n It was very long and specific work, but it helped me to learn about how the class was going to be a lot of outlining, as well that the class would have most of the notes done outside of class.\n \n If a teacher were to assign a project that involved coloring and such, then the student would be able to reasonably guess that the class would have a lot of coloring and drawing.\n \n Or if the assessment were to be that the student should read and annotate\n \n The Crucible , then the student would expect that there would be a lot of reading and annotating in that class.\n \n If the project were student designed, then the student would not have that advantage of knowing what to expect in the course.\n \n A student may realize when doing the summer project that the class would be far too strenuous for them, if so, then they can change their class to an easier class before school starts.\n \n Students do not always pick the easiest projects, so it may not be the most beneficial for their learning to design their own.\n \n The lack of specific guidelines on the project may make it harder on the teacher to grade, as well as harder on the student to know what is the work needed to get the highest grade.\n \n As well, the nature of the project may give the student insight into what the class is going to be like.\n \n Summer projects should be teacher-designed and not student designed, because students will not pick projects helpful to their learning, teachers and students can have an easier time knowing what is going to get the highest grade, and it helps the student to know what the class will be like.\n \n After all, the teacher is the one who is teaching the class.",

      "Letting teachers design the project is the most ignorant design ever. Most students would hate to do a teacher design project. The projects should definitely be student design. I strongly believe a summer project is an intelligent way of letting students retain the information. However it should be student design because they'd be more likely to do it, they'd understand the project more, and it gives them responsibility.\n \n Firstly, students would be more likely to participate in a student-designed project. A whole of of students won't be pleased doing a summer project, so the least schools could do is let the students design the project. Also some teachers make projects way too boring. So if the students design the project it'd probably be less boring for them. It'd be much better to let the students could be as creative as they want. When people find something boring they won't do it, especially young people. So letting the students design the project would increase the chances of the student passing the project.\n \n Secondly, the students would understand the project more. Some teachers make extremely confusing rubrics for the project. When teachers make confusing rubrics it causes a negative reaction to the students trying to complete the project. Some students would lose confidence in themselves on the project, which will increase their chances of failing. That would be a horrible startÂ to the new school year. The goal is for students to pass not fail, and teacher design projects would really increase failing chances. Students will have a hard time passing something they don't understand, because like I said earlier; some teachers make really confusing project-designs.\n \n Lastly, is it gives the students more responsibility. Responsibility is one of the most important things a young person can learn. It helps with maturity & being a better adult. So the student would be responsible for the project & designing it. I know it's very little responsibility, however it does help.\n \n Projects should definitely be student designed. Student design projects teaches students more responsibility. Also it would make students more likely to complete the project. If schools do make summer projects, I hope that they are student designed.Â",

    essay:
      "Some schools implement a summer project to continue the flow of learning, and to ensure that the students' brains retain learned information. When asked to take a position on whether students or teachers should design these projects, I chose both sides. The reasoning behind my decision was quite simple: one side is more knowledgeable when it comes to the information, and has years of experience in teaching on their side. However, nobody knows the experience of living as the secondary group more than they themselves do, so it makes sense that they would have a part in this idea.\n \n Allow me to begin by playing devil's advocate against my own thinking. One may refute my statements with the simple argument of, \"Well, students don't know how to teach, so why should they have a part in this?\". One may also describe my thinking as 1 by stating along the lines of, \"Well, nobody knows how to plan exciting experiences better than the ones who have to endure them\". Now, both these arguments are well rooted and difficult to counter, however that in and of itself is what lends them to my cause. The first argument supports the idea that teachers are more experienced, thus more prepared to enact such ideas and projects; the second argument then supports my secondary belief, that the students better know themselves, and can lend more than a simple helping hand in the creation of such activities.\n \n Now that I have finished counter-arguing and rebutting, I can begin my statements. I would like to begin with the teachers. My standing on the subject is that teachers are more experienced and better suited to plan the informational aspects of a summer's project. Why, if a student knew the subject matter well enough to plan such an activity, and knew how to best teach and explain it, then they would be in no need of a project or a teacher! Yes, it is the job of the teacher to... well, teach, and it is the job of the student to learn. However, this does not exclude the student from the planning process all together.\n \n The student is quite important, because they are the target audience. They will know, better than anyone, how to reach out and grab hold of their demographic. The student knows what is fun, boring, enticing, and annoying to them as a whole. While it is true that not all students are made equal, and what is fun to one may be dull to another, a democratic poll can be issued to help even the playing field. Alternatively, multiple projects can be issued out to different types of student, or a simple skeleton plan may be issued, with which the students may piece together their own project. Perhaps all three can be issued as a choice, with students choosing which \"flavor\" of project they would find easiest to follow. Yes, the student is an important piece to project design, with the teacher serving a bigger part in project management. Let the demographic choose their product.\n \n As I finish, allow me to restate my core ideas. The teacher is an important utility in the informational and managerial parts of a summer project; however, the student plays just as important a role in the design and creationalÂ aspects. Both sides are nearly equal in importance, and choosing just one as the end all be all is not dissimilar to how American politics are carried out. Yes, it is important to have a fair balance of both sides, with each person playing to their specific strengths. Too much equality and you have a democracy that will never move forwards. Too much freedom and you have a form of communism in which there is no order to help guide everyone to the correct paths. Yes, a balance is much needed; a balance, mind you, that will never be truly found.\n \n That doesn't mean we shouldn't try, however.",

      "Would you want to waste your summer on useless information, or getting a head start on what you are going to learn next year? Teacher-designed summer projects usually prepare you for what you will be learning. So, why not take that chance and have a head start. Teachers make these assignments for the students benefit. It is always better to be prepared, than to be struggling. Summer assignments should be teacher-designed, because the teacher would relate it to what they are going to learn, they could give the students a challenge and choices, and their topics could be more relevant to society.\n \n Although, teacher-designed summer assignments could be more relevant, student-designed assignments would be more fun. The students know what they are interested in more than teachers do. Students could create and design summer assignments that they would enjoy. Doing something fun and entertaining to the students would make their summer not feel like a waste, even though it is for school. However, it may be more fun than if teachers made the assignment, but it would be a waste of time and effort. Students could make the assignment whatever they want and not have it benefit them in any way.\n \n Having a summer assignment about what you are going to learn could help you prepare for that class. Teachers know what their students will be learning, so they should make summer assignments related to that. The assignment would then prepare them for that class next year, and their summer would not have been a waste after all. This could help many students, because everyone learns at a different pace. Students who need more time than others to comprehend the information would be getting a head start. So, when they come into school, they will not be struggling or behind everyone else.\n \n Students could get a challenge or a choice to choose what they want, benefiting them and their interests. If students came up with the assignments, they could be too easy. Teachers know a students limit by their academic skills. If students had a challenge in the summer, it could be something they have never experienced before or thought about. Students would be learning and enjoying their summer at the same time.\n \n Summer assignments should be relevant to society and not useless information. Teachers are usually aware of what is going on in society, whether that is economically or politically. They could make a summer assignment about an issue in our society. If there was a summer assignment like that, there would be many online resources to help the students since it is a current topic. This would also benefit the students by enlightening them in the problems of their own society and community.\n \n In conclusion, summer assignments should be teacher-designed to benefit the student. Not all summer assignments are boring. They might require you to read a book or do some research, but it would help you in the near future. Students who do summer assignments are less likely to be confused or behind in class, since they had a preview of what they were learning. Teacher-designed summer assignments benefit students by giving them a head start on what they are learning, the assignment could be a challenge or a choice, and the topics could relate to society making it more relevant.Â",

      "During summer break, it's a time in which the majority of kids are outside enjoying themselves at the pool,beach, an amusement park, or a new country they've been waiting to visit all year long, but for some kids, however, they are required to complete boring summer long projects that are designed by teachers in order to further develop their education.\n \n When you think about these summer long projects, many of them are designed in a way that makes them a struggle for students to enjoy doing themselves while they're on break, the majority of teachers design these projects as a way of continuing with the development of their students education, but don't put into thought what a student might be doing over the summer and how their project can relate to the activities they do. Some teachers may say that no matter what the students do over the summer, the main goal is to continue with the development of their education, which is completely understandable, but what point is there if these projects are designed in the interests of teachers and not the students.\n \n A summer project isn't something many students enjoy doing, mainly due to all of the months spent in school, but when they're allowed to work on a project with the topic of their choice, or on a project that reflects their summer break, many students would feel enthusiastic about doing their summer project and at the same time, students would feel better with themselves when they make their own decisions in a project rather than have a teacher make the decisions for them and have to follow their guidelines in regards to the project.\n \n In a student's perspective, a summer long project that's designed to improve their education may sound boring to them since they just got out of school, but if students were able to design their own projects and freely decide what their projects would be about, it would be a whole different story. When students are given the freedom of deciding what they want their summer projects to be about, they are capable of understanding the way they express themselves,see their true potential, and further understand how to develop their education based on their strengths and weaknesses.\n \n Schools should consider letting their students design their own summer projects, as a way of helping them develop their education and learning skills. When students are given this opportunity, it's more likely that the student will enjoy working on their project, complete it, and see their academic advancements as they continue to work on their projects.",

      "During the school year, classroom instructions and lessons are prepared and taught by the teachers, so why wouldn't the summer assignments that keeps kids prepared for school, be made by teachers ? Summer assignments allow students the chance to stay ahead of their classwork and curriculum while they are away from school. These assignments help kids in many ways, whether it be to prepare for the SAT, ACT, or just a little head start for an advanced placement class. Teachers know the curriculum of their classes better than some principles, so it is only right that these assignments be prepared by the teachers themselves. Teachers need to be in charge with making their summer assignments because they may have specific ways they want their incoming students to learn, they have the most experience in the subject they teach, and students may be exposed to new styles of learning that could help them far beyond just school.\n \n Teacher-made summer assignments are great for preparing kids for the next chapter of school. With that being said, student-designed assignments would not be such a bad alternative. Students only grasp knowledge and lectures when they find interest in them. What better way on finding out how summer assignments can interest students, then to just let the students come up with the layout of the assignments themselves. Nobody can relate to students more then themselves. Some students are hands on learners while others are more visual learners, students could come up with multipleÂ assignment designs that meets the needs of physical and visual learners. Summer assignments that are made by teachers in one way may not help a physical learner but aid the visual learner, or vice versa and that would not be fair to either student.\n \n At all schools, teachers have a required curriculum they must teach to their students in a certain time period. Allowing the teachers to make the projects would greatly reduce the time spent in the classroom on going backwards in their curriculum to catch students up, and allow them to move forward faster. Many colleges around the world look at the scores of students SAT's and ACT's. These two test have a certain amount of curriculum that is covered through all years of learning. Unfortunately, many teachers do not have enough time to cover all the material on the two tests. Summer assignments give kids that extra needed practice and knowledge to do well on the tests.\n \n The SAT and ACT are not the only test students have to take while they are in school. Students also must take subject specific test and quizzezs for their individual teachers. Since, teachers are responsibleÂ for making their own test for the students, they may have a specific way they want their students to study or look over the material, summer projects are no different. Teachers are human, each one of them has a different method of teaching and testing. By allowing the teacher to design their summer project, it allows for kids to be ready for the methods their teacher uses to test and lecture. Not only could the methods of learning be new to the student, but they also could prefer their teacher's new ways more than what they used in the past.\n \n Summer Projects should be teacher made because they cover materials that students will need to use in the classroom and also show's the student kinda how the teacher likes to teach and deliver the curriculum in the classroom. Teachers go to college for 4 years just so they can teach people. They are the most qualified in helping any person succeed academically. If you are a parent, tell me honestly, would you trust your own child in coming up with their own school assignments ? Â Â Â Â  Â",

      "Why are student-designed summer projects beneficial?\n \n School is important for everyone. The law is that everyone who is born in the United States must attend school. School is a time where you study to get good grades, develop strong bonds with teachers and friends, and having a fun time. During the school year, students get to choose what classes do they want to take. After students select what classes they want to take for next year, they usually get summer assignments or summer projects to prepare them for the upcoming school year. In other states, summer projects or summer assignments are either teacher-designed or student-designed. I always preferred that summer projects should be student-designed because it allows the student to have creativity, an easier way to self-study, and it engages the student's learning.\n \n Doing a project brings astonishing ideas to a student. When the teacher gives a simple task to do a project by using tri-fold display boards, construction paper, and color; it gives the student the freedom of what they want to create. Students grow a mindset of what will help them. Some students do well by being creative because some of themÂ are visual learners. Visual learners understand materials by looking at a specific picture to capture the concept, so it can be a part of their memory. When creative students start coloring; it gives them less stress. Less stress causes to work faster and gives relief, and it helps them to make a nice presentation. Creativity also brings the teachers attention when it's time to present. Teachers will see that these creative students took their time to make a neat artwork and helped them to understand their assignment by designing it themselves.\n \n Self-studying prevents the student to be behind. Self-studying can be hard at first, but once you understand how to do it and manage it; therefore, it becomes easier. Studying by yourselfÂ doesn't make youÂ re-read, highlight, and memorize the textbook the whole day. UseÂ different ways to study such as doing projects, making flashcards, or teaching it to a friend. Most of these self-study learners make detailed projects to make it enjoyable for them, and it can make them motivated. For example, you are taking an biology class in the fall. Your assignment says to make a project that makes you notice nature. You come up with a brilliant idea and make a bird feeder. You use creative ideas along the way such as making a bird feeder out of an old milk carton. After that, you put half of the seeds inside and the other half on the ground.Â To observe your data, you would see which type of birds came to your feeder, what time, and what day of the week. This shows that you noticed nature by motivation and self studying by making data.\n \n During the summer, students learn new material for their future classes. When learning about new knowledge during break, it makes students more engaged. Students don't have a deadline when they can study, so they take it easy by doing it step by step. Since some students get bored over the summer, they get curious to find new things. There are students who make their own projects to see how intelligent they are in that subject. By making projects, students have the will to discover their learning path. They have the time to go out to different museums or national parks for ideas for their project. They notice what they can establish in their future life by observing areas, so then they research more to make their summer project even better. The students designed their own projects by having the time to explore around themselves, making experiments, and taking risks. All of this helps them to engage their learning.\n \n In conclusion, projects should be student-designed because it allows the student to have creativity, an easier way to self-study, and it engages the student's learning. Making summer projects that are student-designed helps learning grow and makes teachers proud of what their students can accomplish. Student-designed projects give no procrastination, spend more time with friends, and manages your time easily. This is why student-designed projects are more beneficial than teacher-designed projects. Â Â Â",

      "The idea of summer projects for students is a great way to assure that they are continuing to learn outside of school independently. This is true when the students have the freedom and responsibility to choose which subject they want to deepen their knowledge about. Although teachers have the ability to design specific projects that relate directly to the curriculum, students would find completing their projects more enjoyable if they had the freedom to research a topic that they experienced first hand, as well as displaying an opportunity to those who travel and may research different cultures.\n \n Schools that allow the students to design their summer projects may include a list of topics provided by teachers to assure all students remain on task with the curriculum as well as develop a passion for their topic. With a list of examples provided, students may get creative with ideas and become passionate about their work, which should be the most important goal schools attempt to get their student to achieve. With passion, students become motivated to continue studying even when it is summer break.\n \n Moreover, those fortunate enough to travel have endless possibilities when designing their projects: from the chemical makeup of jet planeÂ fuel to the traditionsÂ and customs of villages in third world countries, there is no limit. By being able to experience new cultures, examine pieces of art work, sight seeÂ great monuments, etc..., students may design extravagant projects that expose others to what they have experienced. When students present their project at the beginning of the following school year, those who did not get to travel may learn about topics they weren't able to experience themselves, making all students inclusive in eachothers summer activities.\n \n Although some may believe that teachers should design the student's projects, this should not be the case if schools wish for their students to learn to be responsible and independent. If teachers were to design the projects, yes, it would be guaranteed that it follows the curriculum, but there will be a clear lack of passion in the student's work. Forcing a topic students have no interest in or are unable to experience first hand will bring the students to resent learning during their break. And for those traveling, some may not have access to specific requests the teachers assign, forcing them to either return home to complete their project or to produce something mediocre. Students being able to design their own project that works best around their schedule would benefit everyone.\n \n Schools who allow students to design their own projects are giving the opportunity to be creative, independent, and responsible. With passion mixed in, possibilities for greatness are endless. Schools that have teachers design projects should reconisder and follow the schools that allow students' footsteps.",

      "Education is, without a doubt, a necessity in order to ensure a successful life- and it is the school's job to give the students exactly that. During the school year, they do so with classes and homework, but what about when school is already over? Many schools opt to let the students rest during these times, but some schools decide to take it up another step with summer projects. How the projects should be conducted, though, has been a matter of debate recently, and many are taking different positions and stances on the issues, largely divided into two different sides: teacher-directed and student-directed. The teacher-directed side believes that the teachers should take the lead and decide what they expect from the project, while the student-directed side believes that giving the students more freedom in what to do will allow them to learn more in the process. While it is easy to see how students would like a project designed by themselves, school projects should still be primarily designed and directed by the teachers.\n \n To start, teacher-designed projects allow for a more intuitive and in-depth project that students could not develop on their own. A human's brain does not develop fully adulthood; it is immature, and as such, leaves students prone to make decisions that may harm their own education. Furthermore, teachers have gone through rigorous training and have an intimate knowledge of their own subject, and thus can create projects that are on topic and beneficial to a student's education; on the other hand, students are only beginning to learn their subjects, and do not have the proper training or the knowledge required to create a project that allows them to learn.\n \n However, some may think that teacher-designed projects limit creativity and make the projects overall less enjoyable for the students. It is easy to think that way, but by limiting some creativity, teachers are actually ensuring proper education during the summer. If a student designed a project, for example, they could deliberately make the project simple, giving themselves an easy grade when, in reality, they learned nothing. To continue, the students could derail the project, straying away from what the teacher or school intended for them. All of these and more make the projects pointless and a waste of resources and time, but teacher-designed projects ensure that students stay on topic, while also raising the quality and benefits of the projects by requiring a bare minimum.\n \n Finally, teacher-designed projects allow for a standardized rubric that makes grading easier and simpler for teachers. Student-designed projects can be anything, especially since the teachers do not have control over them. Consequently, the teachers must adapt in response to the varied project types and qualities, making a rubric harder to define. This means that teachers require more time and effort to grade each project, making an already exhausting task even more arduous. However, a teacher-designed project is the same for every student, meaning everyone makes the same thing about the same topics. This lets the teachers focus on assessing more important skills and the quality of the project instead of checking solely completion.\n \n In short, a student-designed project simply cannot provide the in-depth education that a teacher-designed project gives. Summer break, while it is indeed a break, does not mean education ever stops. It is up to summer projects- and teachers, consequently- to keep it that way.",

      "Summer projects can be a helpful tool for both teachers and students to ensure that students will be ready for the next school year and not forget what they learned the previous year. Summer projects should be enriching, creative, and fun for students. While a student-designed project may be creative and fun, it would most likely lack the enrichment component which is the whole point of having summer projects. Ultimately, teachers know better than students how to prepare for the upcoming school year, which is why these summer projects should be teacher-designed rather than student-designed.\n \n Student-designed projects may sound like a good idea at first, but students would not be able to create a project that would prepare themselves well enough for the next year; at least not the same way teachers can. Students are already unmotivated to do any summer homework let alone projects. However, there is definitely an appeal to creating your own projects, which would help motivate students to complete and do a good job with the project. Most likely though, if students were given free reign to design their summer project themselves, they would take advantage of the opportunity and make a project that is too easy and in the end, unhelpful. This outcome would be even worse than just doing a teacher-designed project which would actually help students.\n \n Teachers know exactly how to prepare students for the next year, so although their project may be harder and not as fun, it would pay off in the long run and help students develop important skills they would need for the next year. Because the goal of summer projects is to make sure students are learning over break, teachers tend to focus too much on the content of the project and often do not make the project creative or fun. Often times, a teacher-designed summer project will be to read a book, analyze it, and write an essay about it. These types of projects are not fun for students, and the result would be a clear lack of effort from the student. I myself have experienced this, and know firsthand that students need to be interested in the project to ensure quality work. In order to avoid this and cater to students creativity, teachers should design multiple projects for students to choose from incorporating various skills such as art, writing, or research. This way, students have a choice and can pick whichever project they would have the most fun doing.\n \n Ultimately, teachers know what they are doing better than students, and can make summer projects fun for the student while also helping them continue learning for the next year. Teachers can always get feedback from students and implement new ideas on how to improve the same project to make it better for the next year, whereas students would not be able to do this. With having more experience and knowledge, it is best that the design of summer projects be left to the teachers.Â",

Knowing some of the knowledge will make the students dive deeper into the material and learn new things. Creativity allows students to think outside the box and explore beyond technology. Giving students the responsibility of choosing their own subject would make them interested into doing their project and enjoy making it.\n \n Students should do their projects based on what they are most familiar with. It would make it easier for them to do a project based on what they already know, so they would most likely start it immediately. They could also search through the web for new information. They benefit from it because they get to learn new material and are able to use it for the project. Although searching through the web is easy and fast, they could also visit places related to what their subject is about and collect new information from the place they visited. They can learn by being physically there and understand deeper by doing hands on work.\n \n Creativity allows them to think outside the box. Depending on the subject, they could experiment new things. They could use their mind freely and do whatever they would like to do. For example, teachers would be strict about what they would like the students to do and use but since you are free to be creative; you would be able to organize the information however you want it to be organized and how to introduce your project. Your project will be made up of your personality. If you want vibrant colors, dull colors, a variety of information, less information, pictures, or no pictures;it is all up to you. You get to express yourself with your project.\n \n In conclusion, if you let the students portray their projects in their own unique way.

      "Certain schools make students complete a summer project to make sure students are still learning over their summer break. There is an ongoing debate over if teachers should design these projects or if students should. Some believe that the student should design the project because it is their summer break and it gives them time to be creative but this is not true. Teachers should design the summer project, not the students.\n \n There are a variety of reasons why teachers should design the project. Teachers purpose in this is to make sure the students project is educational and will benifit them in the long run. A teacher is a professional and will most likey pick a topic that will help them through the summer untill they get to school. Students might pick a topic or design their project on something that might not benefit them significantly educationally. Along with teacher design would come clear and formal instructions. Provided the teacher designs the project the instrustions should be crystal clear and students will be on the right path and most likely less confused than if they had to do it all themselves. Teacher design will aswell booost the project in looking more formal provided rubric can show expectations that need to be met. When teachers provide a project for their class, everyone has the same assignment, and it not only makes it easier for them but the students. This makes said project still formal but everyone can add their creative skills making it more personal giving it their own twist. With the same summer project and teachers permission, it would aswell be easier to work with others and share ideas. Teacher design benefits the students.\n \n There are further reasons on why teachers should be the ones designing students projects. Teachers know what will benefit the students, preparing them for their next year. Edcationally they will design a project based to fit their class and that will help their students. This is teachers being hard working and picking themselves what is best for their students. As stated previously everyone having the same project would benefit the teachers aswell. Multiple projects after a long summer is hard to grade but with everyone having the same assignment and rubric it would make it easier for the hard working teachers. The teacher deciding and designing how they would want their project would asvwell be a plus for them. They decide how they want it as well as theirs expectations, which makes it clearer for the student to unerstand as stated previously. Teachers designing the summer/schiool year projects benefit both students and teachers.\n \n The summer project should be designed by the teachers and not the students. There are many reasons why teachers should design it, for example it makes it easier for both the teachers and the students in the long run. those who disagree state that it would make it easier, more creative, and fun for the students but realistically this is not true. School work at anytime of the year should be designed and given by the school, this puts order in the school system.",

      "Schools should have summer projects be teacher-designed because teachers will pick projects that they know will be usefull to students, teachers put their full time and effort, and teachers will also make the project enjoyable to the students.\n \n Teachers have created many projects for many of their students, making them have a lot more credibility than students to construct a project. Teachers will know what information will be on the project makin it easier for them to construct projects that they know will be of use to students in the future. They all have insight on what a student should learn and what a student should not learn because they have been teaching all year long to students. They would take out all the useless information because they know how to filter it out, while students are learning themselves and will not know how to identify usefull information from useless making teachers more credible on the projects that would be assigned to students. Teachers can also make this project very clear and precise so that students will not get confused on what to do, how to research it, and how to write it professionally, unlike students who always go out of their way to make the project more lengthy and the basis of the project a lot more confusing to understand. Teacher know about the main ideas or concepts about these projects while students are unaware of these main ideas because they are yet to learn about it.\n \n So many teachers put so much time and effort into teaching their class everyday for an eight-month period, which makes it easier for them to create projects because they are so comfortable in this type of creative/learning environment. They put maximum effort to make all this information very precise and straight to the point while students usually, when it does not affect their grade, slack the work load by doing creating he project half-heartedly and not with their full time making the learning experience for the students researching the project also not as fulfilled to learn. When people make it seem like they put their full effort into teaching you about something, that sense or feeling that they invested a part of time into making your learning experience a lot more impactful, you are more compelled to study and learn about what they are teaching you and telling you to pracitce, which is what teacher do and are meant to do. Teachers will always have the time to give out and make projects because that is their job and they have to take it serious unlike students who either creating the project is not fulfilled to do their part or students just do not have the time of day to invest their time into projects. If students do take an investment of time to create these projects, they will not be able to focus on the other important things that they have to get done.\n \n Teachers also have a way of making learning a lot more fun and interactive on their daily teaching schedule, therefore, making them have a way to encapture a students attention into making these projects a lot more enthusiastic and enjoyable to research on. Teachers also make the projects a lot less objective based learning, teachers want to make sure that you understand the content to its fullest extent while also maintaining a curiousness towards the basis of the project, unlike students who make the project seem very boring, uninteresting, and very objective based learning which will make students to never research anything about that certain topic again because they could not learn anything fun about it or there was no interactiveness between the students and the project they were assignes to.\n \n In short, teachers have a better advantage and a lot more insight on how to design these projects because they know what information that will be of use to students, they put the maximum amount of time and effort, and they make the learning experience more enthusiastic and enjoyable to the students doing research on them. Teachers always seem to have the upper hand about how to pass off knowledge and wisdom because of these reasons.Â Â",

      "Grades are everything to students, even more so to students who want a bright future. Those students always turn in everything and always do thier work. Even those types of students get bored too. Students want something fun and interactive, and matbe they will actually enjoy school. Children, just like adults, don't want to do something they don't enjoy. The goverment actually requires kids to go to school and only miss 14 days of school each semester. Them making kids go to school takes the fun out of it. Then there are the teachers, some make school great and others not so much. Therefore, kids get themselves into trouble. They don't do it because they're bad kids, they do it because they're bored and wanna have fun. Then kids skip class, to hang out with their friends, or they just skip school all together. Some even get into fights, just beacuse they're bored and want to do something. Students don't like doing hoemwork, or class work, either. They like it least of all when they have to do it over summer break, but if we let them make up their own summer projects they are more likely to do it, have fun, and be creative.\n \n To begin, students don't want to do homework or projects, but if we give them a little trust and freedom to make their own project, they are way more likely do actually do they project. Kids don't like to be told what to do. The solution is to let them do what they want to, for their own projects. They come up with the concept and the idea, that makes sure that they are interested in it. A great example is, if you tell a teenager to make a project for science class, and they want to make a video game, let them. They can program a very low level game during the summer, and when school is back in session they can show they class and everyone can play it. Not only does this help that kid learn new skills and learn about science, but he can feel a sense of pride when people want to play his game. Some also say that playing video games can help them learn about certain classes. Just like, how minecraft can teach you a lot about earth science, a kid playing minecraft and trying to find ways to fix bugs with in the game, can help him learn skills for his programming class. Students are more likely to do a summer project, if they can create it themselves.\n \n Secondly, children need to be creative. This day and age creativity is even more important then it ever has been before. For them to be successful, they need to be different and think differently than others. They have to stand out from the crowd. Letting students make their own summer projects can help them do just that. Letting kids create something, not only benefits them now with a better grade, but benefits them later in life too. They learn that nothing that you love doing will be easy to achieve. That you have to really work at it, no matter how small it may seem. Students will most likely create something they love and can do it themselves. An example is, a student loves to bake and her english teacher told her class that they had to make a project on the book they just read, Romeo and Juliet. This student decides she is going to make the balcony sence, where the two characters are just talking. That student did something, she really didn't want to do, and turned it into something fun. That girl got to do soemthing she really loved and challenged her self to make soemthing so big. Children need creativity, so why not let them do their own summer projects?\n \n Last, but not least, kids need to have fun. They aren't going to do something that isn't fun. Kids aren't goin gto do something they can't pick. Thats like your parents forcing you into dance and you really hate dancing, but really love writting. Your not going to want to go to dance, you going to try everything to get out of it. Having fun is apart of life and if you never have fun, how are you suppose to enjoy life? People have fun in different ways, every person gives fun a different meaning. One kid might think partying is fun and another might think playing sports is fun. The point is, to enjoy not only a school project, but life, you need to have fun. If we let the students pick their own summer project, than they will have a much better time doing it. Isn't that whats most important? For everyone to have fun and not push it off, or just not do it. A good example of this is, a swimmer, a person who loves to swim competitively, does a science project on the human body. The project is on how the depth of the pool can effect your sleeping habbits. The student is going to have much more fun doing that instead of some stuffy, old project her teacher gave her. Students need to be able to have fun, letting them choose their own summer projects guarintee that.\n \n On the other hand, everyone choosing thier own projects, will make it harder on the teachers, to grade. They have not thought about, the students. Making it easier on themselves, doesn't make it better for their students. Teachers giving everyone the same projects doesn't make it fun or interesting. It makes it harder, because you want yours to be different, but the chances of that are really small. Then when they get back from break, they don't get that sense of pride and they can feel poorly aboout themselves. Teachers must let students make their own projects, not only does it help them have fun, be creative, and actually do the project, but it also helps them figure things out on their own with no help. That skill has to be taught somehow, why not through a summer project?\n \n In conclusion, students should design their own summer projects. This not only helps them now, with a grade, but it also helps them in the future, with very important skills. Teachers are going to have a harder time to grade these projects, but isn't it worth it? Teachers are here to teach students to be ready for life. Students don't like homework, but they would if they want to, having fun, and being creative.",

      "As a student, the summer projects should be teacher-designed projects. Summer projects should be teacher-designed projects due to the fact that teachers know what the students need to learn in the next grade. For an example, in first grade you learn how to add and subtract using double digit number, if the teachers designs the project for the summer you will have more knowledge about adding and subtracting. Also, teachers know the material to help you succeed in school. Not to mention that if the student designs it how would students gain knowledge of it? As students, they would rather have easier homework and easier projects rather than homework and projects the will benefit you. Lastly, teachers know what is needed to know in the upcoming grade; So the teacher-designed can help them prepare for the next grade.\n \n Student based projects are not a good idea for several different reasons. The student-designed projects are not beneficial to students due to the fact that students don't know what is going to be learned in the next grade level, so how they going to know how their own project is going to benefit themselves? As for teachers, they are going to know what is coming up in the upcoming grade. Another reason is due to the fact that students are going to do a easy projects. Not all easy projects benefit you to have more knowledge, therefore teachers design the projects so that students could gain more knowledge off the project. Lastly, the teacher-design project is going to prepare you for the next grade, so you will be more advanced with subject when you get in the class next year.\n \n To sum up, Teacher-design summer project benefit you in many different ways. It can benefit you by working to learn upcoming material. Teacher-design projects also benefits you by teachers knowing what is needed to know in the next grade. Finally, it benefits you because teachers know what is coming up in the upcoming grade level, so it helps you prepare for the next grade level. Student-designed can also benefit you in gaining knowledge, but not as much knowledge from teachers-designed projects.",

      "Most students look forward to the last few days of school, those last few moments when the bell is about to ring and they can all go and hang out, or just go home and relax. After a whole school year's worth of work they are ready to take a nice break. But then those hopes are ultimately hurt a little when a teacher announces that the students are to complete projects over the summer. These projects should be student designed because of the work being assigned over vacation, giving the students a chance to self-govern themselves, and because they will have extra free time to work with.\n \n Some teachers would agree that if the students were to assign themselves projects, nothing would get done, or the students would not learn anything new. This really should not matter in the long term as the teachers already have enough control during the school year, and the students really should be allowed a break from all this learning. If the students do not get the break they might need, than what is the point of a vacation?\n \n Speaking of that vacation, students need that time to relax and unwind, preparing themselves for the next year. Some parents might even have big vacation plans over the summer to take their families interesting places. This means that a student will have to work his or her summer homework around the vacation time, which, in some cases, can be really challenging. One student might have a big project to get done, but their parents announce that they are taking a family vacation to Germany for a couple of weeks. Of course, this might not seem like a lot of time, when school stops, that does not mean everything else does as well. These students might have jobs to keep up with or other responsibilities outside of school, these projects just make things even harder than they need to be. When you give students a larger window to finish something, they get the chance to improve their leadership skills, either in a group, or with themselves.\n \n Students who design their own projects will get the chance to self-govern themselves, meaning they have more time to make creative decisions that can improve the project, rather than just having a week or so to finish it where they might rush it, or cannot dedicate enough time outside of school to get it done in time, lowering the overall quality. When students get to make these creative decisions, they can make the students think in new ways and bring out more interesting decisions to make the projects stand out a little more. All of this culminates in the extra free time the students have to think, execute, and produce a well-made product.\n \n The extra free time gives students more freedom to try more ambitious projects without the pressure of all the work that needs to be done within a week. The project will be able to develop naturally over time. If teachers assign these projects, then either the student will feel less compelled to do it, or it will not turn out as well because the student might not want to do that type of project in the first place. This extra free time is a great source for creativity and good student led projects because the students will be more compelled to do the work right, rather than just get through it so they can actually enjoy their break.\n \n Overall, these students would really feel bummed if they were required to do extra work over the summer for seemingly no reason at all, other than to continue learning. With student-designed projects, students will still get to enjoy their vacation, while learning more about self-governing, and making good use of their extra free time. Going to school is not something that everyone in the world enjoys, but is required, so if the teachers are really going to strip away some of the student's free time, at least let the students be in control. If you give the children more freedom, the creative results may be beyond anything you have ever seen.",

      "Summer school projects should be student lead because they allow students to keep their brain fresh, achieve a goal, and understand new concepts. School projects over the summer should be student designed. This allows students to keep their brain active, have a goal to accomplish, and learn new things. Projects to complete over the summer are a good tool for schools to use to keep their students ready.\n \n Some students might think a project for school over the summer is tyranny, however, keeping your brain thinking is very important. An interesting project, that should be mainly student-designed so completion is high, is a good brain helper. A benefit of the project will be once the students go back to school, it'll be easier to jump back into familiar topics because your brain has had a refresher recently. Freshman year of high schoolÂ I had an English project over the summer on Mythology which greatly helped me when I returned to school and Mythological stories was our first unit. Overall, keeping your brain up-to-date is an excellent way to be confident in your schooling career.\n \n During summer break a lot of kids end up being bored at home just watching TV or playing video games. A project, designed by students so the kids can stay engaged and interested, could shake this monotony and give the student a goal to accomplish. Goals are important and they lead to the person feeling good about themselves once they complete said goal. On the other hand, a student might say how they don't need a goal to stay active during the summer but they can always benefit from something to hold them accountable so just in case the student starts heading on a downward trend, the goal can lift them up and set them back on track.\n \n Learning new things is an important task to do often. Having a student lead project is a great strategy to allow kids to find and learn new things, explore new concepts, and complete tasks efficiently. Kids learning new things over the summer with a rigorous yet interest-grabbing project is an excellent way to expand the classroom horizon once school is back in session. It allows the teacher to make new teaching decisions such as what projects will look like in the future, what kind of strategies to teach with, and if said teacher can branch off into side topics that they usually couldn't branch off into.\n \n In conclusion, school-assigned projects should be student-designed so interest and completion is high, goals are made and completed, and the students' brain is kept in top shape. The ability a kid has to learn by themselves over the summer should be tapped into by schools more often. Projects to complete over the summer are a perfect tool to keep kids fresh and ready for when school starts back up.",

Students are constantly given assignmentsÂ of which they have chosen and yet, some still never take the addictiveÂ to do the work to help them succeed. If they were to have student-designed some would not even attempt to do the project. Students should have a teacher-designed project because it would encourage them, there would be guidelines and less stress on choosing a topic.\n \n Firstly, some people doÂ not that have the motivation to do a projects and they need something to help keep them on track and push them to do it. Some students have a problem withÂ procrastination when it comes to big assessments such as projects, an essay, or even a simple PowerPoint. For example, they have a 600 word essay due in 2 weeks and its worth 30% of their grade. They will wait 2 days before it is due to finally take time and do it. If a teacher were to have something they have to work toward that they would really want to would drive them to do their best.\n \n Secondly, when there are guidelines to a project it gives that sense of urgency. A project or any assignment should be done without some source of instruction or direction on what to do. For example, if they were given an assignment and just told to do it would come out extremely unorganized. Teachers being in charge of a summer project is much better than students handling it because they have deadlines for each part of the project\n \n However some students want to do a project on something they chose and feel as though they need help with. For example, there is a student who has aced every single lesson that the teacher has taught but, the last lesson that they learned they really had a hard time on understanding it and its time for the projects the be assigned.

      "Schools now are requiring their students to complete summer projects to assure they are learning and maintaining the knowledge gained in the past school year. Though there has been some contemplation as to whether these projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Students should design their projects because it will be in their skill set and the students will be more likely to complete it because it will be in their field of interest. However, there should also be some restriction as well. Students should only get to design their project if the teacher approves of it before hand.\n \n Every student has their own interests and things they like to do, whether it be in or out of school. With projects being in their particular field of interest, they will be more inclined to learn about the topic and complete a project on it. Kids who are more interested in animals and nature might not be as interested in a project about space or robotics, therefore not being as excited to do it and there is even a possibility of them getting a bad grade. From experience in a previous project I completed on manatees, I was interested and wanted to research the topic I chose. Projects that fit best to my interests where more fun and enjoyable, and allowed me to complete it on time while having lots of information on the topic at hand. These projects are also being completed during summer, a time when students are enjoying their long break. A project that is fun and to their liking will help the student get it done quicker and better. Students interests are sometime lost in the teachers decision, therefore they should acknowledge that students all arent the same and allow their students to design whatever project seems the most eye-catching to them. In the end, it makes a more excited and focused student.\n \n Along with students having different interests, they also have different skill sets as well. There is a wide range of courses and topics that each and every student does well with while others find more challenging. For example, a student could have a hard time in a math class while another thrives. Being a student myself, knowing that I would have to complete a project that i'm not as familiar and skilled at would stress me out to the point of not completing it. During summer most students use that time to relax from all their hard work during the school yearÂ and by adding on a project which doesn't align with their skills will cause them to feel panicked and overwhelmed to get it finished on time and have all the key elements. Projects should showcase what a student knows to their class, teachers, and sometimes family, but when given a topic that is far more challenging, they are less likely to complete it to the best of their abilities.\n \n One reason why there is controversy on whether the summer projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed is because the learning aspect of the project could be lost. Students will design projects that will not be connected to the curriculum or non-educational, therefore not allowing the student to learn as much. However, there are ways to avoid this problem. One way is to get the teachers to approve of the given project. In their decision they will hold true to the students interests and skills and help guide the student to design a more 2 project if needed. This will decrease the amount of non-educational projects that some students might come up with and also include the students main interests and better skills, which is often lost in a teacher-designed project.\n \n The requirement of summer projects has much controversy on whether the students should chose their project themselves or the teachers. With the students being able to do so, their certain interests will be included and their skills will be showcased. However, there would be an issue of students picking projects that won't be as educational as the school intended for them to be. To avoid this problem, teachers would approve of the given project, lowering the amount of non-educational projects while also having the student be excited and focused to do the project. In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed, but only if the teacher approves of it.",

      "Summer projects is an excellent way for students to continue learning and to grow academically during breaks while having fun doing it. When teachers assign projects which is designed by them, it decreases the student's motivation to complete the project because students find it amusing to design and create their own projects and not the other way around. Another reason why summer projects should be student-designed is because students are able to research many topics which they could potentially be interested in. Summer projects during the break should be student-designed because it increases student motivation to complete the project, students are able to gain knowledge on something they came up with themselves, and they are able to have fun while conducting research on their own topics.\n \n The first reason why summer projects should be student-designed is because of the increase in motivation. Students are motivated when they are interested in what the project is about. When the project is teacher-designed, student's lack the motivation to complete the task as they could be uninterested in the project the teacher had assigned them. Some students might assume the project will be tedious because the teacher is assigning it and as a result, feel unmotivated. For example, When the teacher assigns a project, it can be difficult to research and come up with ideas which leads to the students feeling stressed and confused on what to do regarding the project. But when a student designs their own projects, they probably already have an idea or information on the topic of their project. Another example is when students are assigned a project, and there is a choice to organzie and create your own project for extra credit, students are motivated to perorm well on the project. That is why schools should have students perform research on their own project topic because it motivates them to get it nicely done. An increase in motivation means an increase in the quality of the project and the thought of satisfaction while completing it\n \n The second reason why summer projects should be student-designed is because students are able to gain a tremendous amount of knowledge as they are coming up with their own ideas on researching, creating, and completing their own projects. For example, during the break, multiple students travel out of state or out of the country. When the students go on vacation, they will locate lots of great topics and ideas to research on. Therefore, increasing the student's knowledge on the topic or idea of the project. This causes the students to become more erudite during the break and when they return back to school from the break. Although the students will still gain knowledge on a teacher-designed project, they do not gain a much broader view on the topic of the project. Another example is when a student works at someplace he or she enjoys working at and decides to do their project on that particular job. This is going to increase the sudent's knowledge as the student is researching more information about the job whilst also learning more about the place he or she works at.\n \n The third reason why summer projects should be student-designed is because students are able to have fun while conducting a research on their topic. Students always want something fun to do; therefore, by designing their own projects, they are able to make it as fun as they want. When the teacher designs the project, the students would probably assume that it is dull. For example, when a student does something for fun over the break, they could do their project on what they did instead of doing a project on something they have never done before. Another example is when a teacher-designed project is assigned and the teacher is extremely facetious about what and what not to include in the project. When this happens, the students won't find the project to be amusing or interesting.\n \n In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed as it greatly benefits the students in many ways such as motivating them, allowing them to gain more knowledge, and having fun whilst working on the project. When teachers design projects for their students, they are not allowing the students to fully expand into many areas but allowing them to conduct a research and work on their project in a way they want it to be done, which limits the students ability to be motivated to work on the project, to gain knowledge on the project, and to enjoy working on the project.",

      "In some schools, projects are given to students to be completed over summer break. The reason a vigarious assignment is given is to assure students will be continuously learning over the summer when schools are temporarily closed. However, should summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Teacher-designed projects should be required for all students. Why should teacher-designed projects be a requirement instead of student-designed projects? Teacher-designed projects expand learning and the teacher is aware of what the students will be learning.\n \n To begin, teachers will be aware that all students are obtaining the same information. For example, a project was given by a teacher specifically on the topic saving and investing in today's economy. The teacher knows that all students will be researching and learning the concepts of saving and investing today. All students gained identical information and knowledge on one specific topic. On the other hand, if projects were student-designed there will be little unity of knowledge amongst students who are of equal age and grade classification.\n \n To continue, teacher-designed projects will expand the knowledge of students. If projects were student-designed they would more likely focus on a topic they already have prior knowledge about rather than stepping outside of their comfort zone. Teacher-designed projects tend to include circulum that students need to know that will help them grow academically. For instance, a group of girls in a high schoolÂ class were given a black history project. They did their project on Misty Copeland, an African-American ballet dancer, who they had previously researched before. They had information instilled into their minds and had already known about her accomplishments and struggles. They did not learn anything about her, because they had done projects before. With that being said, students will not willingly learn anything new if they designed their on projects. Teacher-designed projects would have a more positive impact, because it is being given by a teacher who can academically prepare students for the next school year.\n \n Last but not least, teacher-designed projects enforce specific directions and learning criteria. The projects will less likely be done incorrectly. Directions and criteria is specific, so it will not be off topic and the students will not be learning unnecessary information that will not help them. Teacher-designed projects are more focused on criteria that students need to know.\n \n Conversely, student-designed projects can be more engaging for students who like to be creative, or do things in their own manner. The options are limitless and researching what a student wants to learn will inspire them to obtain more knowledge to share with their peers. Students will be more interested in a project they can create themselves and that leads to results such as less cheating. On the other hand, teacher-designed projects should be required, because some students will focus on what they already know rather than willingly learning something new. The projects that are teacher-designed will less likely be done incorrectly.\n \n In conclusion, teacher-designed projects will not limit students to what they already know, but will help them grow academically. The projects that are teacher-designed will less likely be done incorrectly,Â because the teacher specifies instructions and limits the topics for their projects. Students will flourish more when projects are teacher-designed rather than student-designed. Schools should require summer projects that are teacher-designed.Â",

      "Many schools currently assign projects over the summer to ensure students are still learning over break. There is an ongoing debate on whether said projects should be designed by teachers or students. Some say summer projects should be teacher-designed;Â otherwise, students wont use their full potential, will procrastinate, and won't learn anything of substance, but this is not true. Summer projects designed by students would more efficient than ones designed by teachers.\n \n There are various reasons why student-designed are better at promoting learning during Summer. Students will have more choices of what they can learn about instead of being restricted to what a teacher assigns them for that class. This means students can research subjects ,outside of the curriculum,Â that they may be interested in for their project. Learning about what interests them will motivate students to work harder on their task. Students will want to put more into their project in because it's personal to them, unlike projects designed by teachers. In addition, students won't feel like their time is being wasted on something they see no benefit in. Teacher-designed projects such as research papers, posters, and presentations can be mundane and seem utterly pointless. Students will want to prioritize jobs, relaxation and their social life over a project that they don't have any interest in.\n \n There are additional reasons as to why summer projects should be designed by students. Students will have to complete the project they made on their own free time. This will prepare them for the future, where they have to be responsible enough to set up and accomplish goals independently, without anyone demanding them to. Teachers often make projects that require students to reach very high standards. Failing to meet these standards usually results in failure of the project, which can be stressful. Student-designed projects allow students to reach their own standards, which can make Summer break less stressful. Finally, student-designed summer projects give students something to look forward to. They can be productive and learn without feeling like their summer vacation is being intruded by school work.\n \n Projects assigned during summer break would be more beneficial when designed by students rather than teachers. This is because it causes less stress, makes the students responsible for their work, and motivates them. Those who are opposed to this state teacher-designed projects encourage critical thinking, and learning during Summer, but this is not the case.

      'Should summer projects be designed by teachers or students? Some schools require students to complete summer projects to make sure they are still learning during their break. The most simple thing to do, is to have the teachers design the projects, but why not let the students think for themselves. My take on this, is that students should have to put a little effort in, for once. Summer projects should be student-designed because they deserve some freedom, can show off their intelligence, and will help them develop life skills.\n \n Some may say teachers are more educated and have more experience; That might be true, but how are the students supposed to get a real experience if they never get to design their own project. My friends like when a teacher gives the class a project that is already planned out. The reason they enjoy this is because they are lazy and do not have to do any work. Teachers know a lot of information which should be passed on to their students. Although, that statement is true, when do the students get to pass their information to the teacher?\n \n Student-designed projects give the kids freedom in what they choose to do. At my old school, the students would have to read one book in the summer and then write a report on it. All my classmates would be so happy because they had the choice to read whatever they wanted. A teacher once told me, "freedom is a gift; We do not get that gift often and it is a mistake." This means, students are rarely given any freedom and all that does is limit them.\n \n Student-designed projects would help teachers see how intelligent their students are. In\n \n Kung Fu Panda , Master Shifu learns from watching Po move around the kitchen, that he has plenty of skill. In that scene, the master learns how much potential the student has by watching him do his own thing. In middle school, we would do our summer projects based on any news topic we read. This allowed the teachers to not only get an idea of who the students are, but also show them a baseline of how smart they are, as well.\n \n The projects that students self-design will help them develop life skills. A student creating a project on their own teaches them responsibility and problem solving. The student will have to find a solution to their topic, which shows responsibility by being able to complete this task well enough, to receive a good grade. My father believes summer projects he had to create on his own assisted him to where he is today. My dad thinks this because it showed him time management, which is a life skill students will need forever.\n \n Summer projects are meant to help students continue to learn over a long break. Although, why not make summer projects have more value? Instead, schools can help the students do more than just learn over break. Summer projects should be student-designed because they should have choice, will show off their intellect, and assists them in developing life skills. The school systems need to work together, to take action on making student-designed projects a priority, for getting students the best education.Â',

      "Should summer projects be Teacher-designed, or Student-designed? I believe that summer projects should be mainly Student-designed, with teacher approval. I believe this because of my own personal experiences. Students that I've seen who receive summer projects are not very interested, if ever interested, in the project assignments they receive. A way to get them more engaged is to have them pick a topic they would be interested in. As long as it pertains to the class of course, this is where teacher approval would take place.\n \n I believe summer projects should be Student-designed. One of the reasons I believe this is because I've seen students struggle with assignments they don't like, so much so, it can come to a point where they either give up,Â or don't even attempt it. My second reason is because it adds a level of involvement from the student, that ensures they're aware of how the assignment is to be done, as well as, their own personal spin on what their project is going to be.\n \n Summer projects should be Student-designed because prompts given by teachers can be quite boring, causing a lack of drive to finish the project, let alone attempt it. Some kids partake in summer jobs, or leave for vacation. The situation concerning the varying student should be reflected in their summer projects as being individualized. What I mean for this is, a student who is busy all the time doesn't always have the time to do a project. Even if they enjoy the content. The form of their project should also vary due to their location. Weather they're traveling all the time, and can only complete the project on an airplane, or maybe they live in an environment without constantÂ Wifi. Giving the student the opportunity to form their own assignment can add a level of enjoyment, to an already chaotic lifestyle thatÂ any student could be living with. Rather the alternative. A standardized project that only 65% of students are likely to turn in.\n \n My Second reason is the level of involvement shown by a student who gets to choose their own topic. Not only will they be more involved, and in sync with what they need to accomplish, they will be able to complete it faster, if not better than they would without their own involvement. Showing this type of involvement can help the student have a better understanding on what their end goal is, and how they can accomplish it, resulting in better work. As well as readiness in the classroom when they come back from summer break. Seeing as how the students don't receive teacher guidance over the summer, if they have a full understanding on their own project, it can result to having a better understanding for the transition into the next year.\n \n Someone who would disagree with my statements would believe that Teacher-designed summer projects are much better for the student. Some reasons for this would be, an extra workload on the student, or possible inappropriate content chosen by the student. In a students life there can be little free time, as life is different for eachÂ student, and adding on the creation of their own project, just adds onto the workload for both teachers and students.\n \n In conclusion I believe that summer projects should be student oriented. A student can show more interest in a personalized project. Secondly a student can gain a better comprehension on what theyre trying to learn from their own project that they enjoy. While some would say that it's an extra burden on teachers to add individualized projects, I believe that the American education system needs to be less standardized. and more individual. We all learn differently, and not every method of teaching is helpful t'words a students education.",

      "As summer starts to roll around, students usually start taking their school work less and less seriously. WhenÂ students are in control of what they are doing, or working on, they are more likely to complete what they started. When a student gets assigned to complete something its harder for them to finish, or to start at all.\n \n These summer projects should be student-designed because students tend to do better when they enjoy what they are working on. When teachers assign work for students to complete, they design it in a more complex manner rather than taking a simpler approach. Many students have more ideas which interest them, that the teachers might not consider, or think of when designing these projects. When teachers design these projects they lead to no benefits on either side. Students should be able to use their imagination and creativity while being on summer break as wellÂ as their knowledge.\n \n Students are always limited when it comes to teacher-designed projects. Such as when a student is assigned something that does not pertain to their life or the real world. This always leads to inactivity or procrastination which then leads to no work being done at all. This also almost never interests the student which makes the work harder, and less easy to focus on. Over the course of a month or two, people in general tend to get bored of things quickly, so it is always good to be working on something that interests them, or that they enjoy.\n \n Teacher-designed projects can also be a good thing as it can guide a student on where to start. It can also give them ideas on what to do, but it is also a gateway for them to not get as good of a grade as they could have gotten if they used their full potential. For example, when a student gets assigned to write a persuasive essay, they would most likely not incorporate any of their own ideas, but rather things they read from other sources. If the student wrote an auto biography on themselves that would spark their interest because it pertains to their own life. They would not have to go out of their way to use sources on something they do not care for.\n \n All in all students should be in control of what they are working on in their own free time, a time especially like summer. When something like a summer assignment is assigned to a student they should automatically have the right to design their own project. They should be able to base their work off their own ideas. When a student is designing their own project they have the best way of knowing exactly what they are doing, which will lead to better results. Lastly they should not have to worry about meeting someones' expectations but their standards,so them designing their own project will lead to less stress as well.",

    essay:
      "Lots of kids love having summer break off from school, but when it comes to summer assignments there's only so much time in the summer for students to fit all their prior plans in with all the over-the-summer school work their teachers assign. And majority of students would also rather not do school work on their break from school and would just want to enjoy the time off but many schools require students to do some sort of school work over the summer to keep their brains active and to help them continue to learn. Some students have take part in saying that they would like to design their own summer projects for many different reason. In contrast, some teachers don't agree with the students for the summer projects to be student-designed. The required summer assignments should be teacher-designed by the students upcoming teacher so that the students can be prepared fully on what they are going to learn for the upcoming school year, so that the their teachers can make sure they include work from last year so they don't forget about the stuff they previously learned about, andÂ because teachers will most likely organize the work to be an appropriate amount since they're use to giving school work with projects and due dates but also understand that there are students that go on vacations and won't have the whole summer to complete an assignment.\n \n Teachers will know exactly how to format these projects and/or school work in correct ways to make their students stay activeÂ in learning and thinking to be prepared for the upcoming school year since they obviously will be teaching it for the rest of the school year. Since the projects and/or school work will be teacher-designed, their teachers can make sure it's relating to things they will eventually go more in depth with but be put into summer assignments to give some challenge or hints to students for what they're gonna go into more throughout the school year. The summer assignment from their upcoming teachers can also give the student an understanding of how the teachers teaching style is. And the expectations the teacher has since the work is given directly to the student by the teacher themselves.\n \n Teachers can also make sure to include in their summer project some previously learned information on their summer assignments to not only see if they remember and fully learned that particular concept, but to also see where as a student they stand and if they need more help or attention with that topic. It can help a teacher get to know a student better by seeing where they stand as a student after the work they did in their previous classes/grade. Also, putting in some challenging work from the previous grade can also tell the students that the particular topic or concept could be something their upcoming teacher thinks is very important to fully understand in order to move forward, or just to understand in general. It can give the student an idea of how their teacher thinks and will be doing things from now on.\n \n Since teachers became teachers by going to graduate school and some having other degrees included for their job, they usually have a good, if not, great understanding of good teaching skills and tactics and work format styles from their own past professors and previous teaching experiences. If they have a lot experience, it could help them gain knowledge over the time being on what worked well for them as a teacher and their students versus what didn't work. The teachers could have also been exposed to many different teaching styles and found one they believe is easiest to understand and/or thinks is easiest or their level of students to understand. Teachers can know ways to make sure projects or assignments could be organized good while also not entirelyÂ taking up a whole students summer with school work. They can organize it so it's spread out or split up into parts at a time so they don't put much pressure on the student who could feel overwhelmed by all the work they have to complete in a short amount of time. Especially if the student waits until the last minute to complete their summer assignment because they thought the assignment was really long and time consuming.\n \n Going back to how some students could think that they could make an assignment just as equally as efficient themselves just as teachers would, teacher-designed projects would be more efficient regardless since it could be more helpful to teacher because it could be based on exactly what the teacher wants to know about what the student knows to help them succeed for the rest of the school year. And most summer assignments are different depending on the class too. If a student is going into a class they've never taken before, how could they make up a student-designed summer assignment to help them when their teacher could just give them a direct summer assignment as a jump startÂ for the school year. Teacher-designed jump-startÂ summer assignments are just lessÂ problematic, more reliable, and reasonable for everyone overall. Â",

    essay:
      "Summer break is the most anticipated time of year for students and teachers because it is a grace period that allows for relaxation and refreshment,of one's soul. The summer sees,the mental maturation of many students without the hindrance of a classroom,holding them back. The learning experience offered in a classroom setting is limited only to what the teacher and state permits. Students are not fully able to express their learning passions because they are forced to learn what the teacher permits. Whereas, during the summer students are free to conduct their own personal investigations on topics that peak their interest, resulting in a much maturer student by the time fall rolls around. To coincide with the theme of change and growth summer promotes, students should have the ability to choose their own projects, to further their educational experience and mental development, without the influence of a teacher.\n \n The ability for students to choose their own summer projects would enhance their outlook on education,because they would study topics that interest them,and not teacher selected topics that would seem like a task. It is a scientifically proven fact that students retain knowledge that speaks to their own curiositiesÂ and that holds the most relevance to them. During the summer, many students travel to new places or try new things. For example, last summer I was blessed with the opportunity to travel to Japan with my friends and family. While I was there I tried new cuisines,participated in festivities and I was able to learn about their history. My time in Japan, sparked an interest that I never knew I had in Japanese Geisha. I spent hours upon hours researching everything I could on them. But, my research was limited because I had to complete an AP Human Geography summer assignment administered by my future teacher. My assignment was to write a paper and create a brochure about a country. I thought it would be a perfect opportunity to write all about my trip to Japan. That is until I realized the teacher had already selected countries based on our last names. I was stuck with Great Britain, a country I already had a lot of knowledge of from history class and videos. I like many students completed the assignment without gaining any new information because doing the project felt as if it were a chore. Though,I do still remember the information I learned from conducting my own research into Geisha. Many teachers would argue that a student designed summer project would lack information or seem to rushed. Which would not be the case at all. Many students would take their time in crafting a project that meets all standards and would probably write more than what is expected, due to the project peaking their interest. Teachers would in fact, see an increase of higher marks. However, if a teacher feels that the project is not up to standards they could always low score it and have the student try again. In allowing students to design their own project teachers will receive projects that exceed all requirements due to the students behind the projects being interested in what they were learning.\n \n If students were able to create their own summer projects, the result would be a more creative,responsible and independent thinking person. Teacher designed projects allow no room for creativity nor responsibility because there are guidelines and an examples set in place by the teacher,students have to follow. Thus, resulting in one hundred or more projects that all sound the same and lack any indication of the student's voice. Teachers would argue that summer projects must be designed by them, so that all students are able to receive full credit. Which is great in theory,but not in the long run. It does not benefit the student to have a guideline or rubric, it only benefits the teacher because the projects would be easier to grade. In the future, once students start working, supervisors will not give them examples of how to properly execute a project. For example, my mother is a graphic designer who is required to come with new ideas for campaigns, brochures and websites. Her boss isn't giving her instructions on how to complete the tasks, at all. She must be responsible in using her mind to come up with creative new ideas that she thinks would satisfyÂ her boss. However, at her old job all the graphic designers were given an example they had to follow. Which resulted in the closing of her old company because they only produced the same design. Luckily for mom, she was able to find another job fast because she was to create designs without assistance. The skills my mother used to think creatively and on her own, was taught in school. But, with teachers designing projects, students get used to a formula they have to follow and are not taking responsibility for their own thinking. Students creating their own summer projects would force students to take time and think of a project that they think would satisfy their teacher. It would stimulate new thoughts and force them to activate the create side of their brain that has not been used for a while,due to teachers constantly creating a rubric and examples for the student. The summer is a perfect opportunity for a student designed project because they would have time to develop their thoughts. Teachers shouldn't design summer projects because it aides in diminishing a student's ability to creatively solve projects.\n \n Students should have the ability to create their own summer assignments because it would promote mental and educational growth that would otherwise be hindered in a classroom setting. Summer break allows students to embark on new experiences that can further expand their knowledge on topics that interest them. It would also allow more time for students to develop their ideas for the project. Which would strengthen their creativity and responsibility skills. Student designed projects would help grow character. Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â",

    essay:
      "Summer vacation offers a wonderful opportunity for adventure, creativity, and imagination often needed during a young adult's adolescence. However, many children and teens often lose their sense of work ethic during the summer, something that they worked so hard to achieve throughout the school year. To retain this sense of work ethic during the summer, many schools often require students to complete summer projects for a grade. Summer projects should be teacher-designed as opposed to student-designed in order to ensure the project is on the right topic and to leave no room for error during grading or cheating.\n \n Firstly, summer projects should be teacher-designed as opposed to student-designed in order to leave no room for error during grading and to eliminate the possibility of cheating. When teachers design their own projects for their students, they have a clear picture of what is required of their students and how to grade them to a high standard. To ensure this, for example, teachers create rubrics that match exactly how they want projects to be done. This leaves no room for error in student projects, as they can follow word for word what the rubric says with no confusion. When students do not have rubrics and are tasked at designing a project for themselves, it is more time consuming for the teacher, as they have to grade each project individually, leaving more room for error as the projects are open-ended, and unfair as each student is then held at a different standard due to uniqueness of projects. Another example of leaving no room for error is a teacher's use of the website\n \n Turnitin. com. Turnitin is a website that teachers use that examines grammar, spelling, use of proper citations, and plagiarism. This Einstein of a website ensures that every project, paper, and presentation that is written online can successfully be graded without the worry of plagiarism, something that lazy students often turn to as a result of desperation after a long period of procrastination. Summer projects that are teacher-designed can use\n \n Turnitin as a grading system to make sure that there is no plagiarismÂ or cheating between students in the school or county, as it would be hard to do if each project was student-based, because many students often prefer to submit their projects using paper-boards or by printing them. Even though the students could have easily plagiarized or cheating on their presentations, teachers will never know unless they use\n \n Turnitin and design the project for themselves. Summer projects should be teacher-designed instead of student-designed because it ensures that every students' project will be on the same topic and graded the same way to ensure fairness, accurate grading, and more time efficiency.\n \n Secondly, summer projects should be teacher-designed as opposed to student-designed to make sure that every student is doing a project on the right topic. By letting teachers design their own summer projects, students are introduced early to what they will be learning throughout the school year in order to get back into the groove of schoolwork and school. An example of these projects are advanced placement biology courses that require summer projects. These advanced placement biology projects are teacher-designed, meaning that the topic, type of presentation, and rubric are already picked for students. When the project is teacher-designed, students are able to better grasp the details of the project and have an insight on what they are going to learn in the actual course. This also helps students come to school prepared, having foreknowledge of the topic the course starts with, which boosts confidence and ease in the class, as opposed to when students design their own summer projects, which may not even be about the core topics learned class, and eventually proven to be unnecessary. Another example of how teacher-designed projects ensure that every student is doing a project on the right topic is by requiring the student to do required reading and research before the class begins, such as in literary courses that require students to read specific books throughout the course. When students are required to read specific books, such as\n \n Lord of the Flies in tenth grade and\n \n The Great Gatsby in eleventh, students are less likely to read the book, instead opting for reading a summary of the book and spoilers online, and in some cases, watching the movie. When a student is tasked with designing their own project for a book or other topic, they always choose an easier, more simple topic that requires no effort or actual understanding of the book. However, when teachers design projects, they ask for specific knowledge of the events that happened the a book, requiring students to use quotes or examples from the text, essentially forcing them to actually do the reading and create an understanding for the book themselves. This is a good thing, because it ensures that the students are actually learning, as opposed to taking the easy way out of things and barely putting effort into their project. Summer projects should be teacher-designed as opposed to student-designed to make sure that every student is doing a project on the right topic because it gives students an understanding of what the course will be like to better prepare students for the fall and because it leaves no room for low-effort projects or mistakes.\n \n Though the summer is often associated with fun and adventure, it should leave no room for procrastination, a monster that eats at your work ethic and feeds on laziness. By having teacher-designed summer projects as opposed to student-designed ones, this eliminates procrastination and cheating, room for error in grading and student confusion, and gives student's an opportunity to get a head start in the course and come into the fall with a foreknowledge of the course at hand.Â",

    essay:
      "I personally think these summer projects should be student designed. Over the summer a student such as myself is so focused on vacation or summer activities we forget whats going on in school. We as students and growing teens need to keep our brains active and focus on education even if it is during the summer. Although teachers may need things to keep their brains or teaching skills active it is more important that the student knows given information due to the fact that teachers have already been through the school system. Over the summer I find myself getting very distracted and losing lots of information doing a project based on school related subjects can help me stay on track.\n \n When a student is on summer break or vacation the burden of school is lifted from their shoulders and their brains become less active. Students can go to bed later and hang out with friends more. These distractions can cause information gained during the school year. In my personal experiences with losing information I find myself learning simple concepts again taught to me the prior year. Keeping your brain active is one of the most important things that can be done by the student in school. Even though teachers need to do the same students are held more accountable.\n \n Even though retaining information can be difficult it must be done to obtain the greatest amount of success. This is exactly why a project can be so useful to keep information fresh in their minds. Growing teens need some type of mechanism to reserve and retain information. Teachers have already done this many times considering that they have been through high schoolÂ college and completed all the requirements of becoming a teacher.\n \n Also teachers have finished school they no longer need to do tasks such as projects. Though they also can lose information it is way less likely to happen. Teachers have already made their way through the education system. A project to them would be to easy and simply pointless. The said project could be made more difficult for the teachers to give them an actual challenge but overall teachers would easily surpass them.\n \n In conclusion I strongly think that students should be given a project to turn in the following year. Some teens just dont hold information as well and need something to keep their minds set on school subjects. Teachers would easily complete this task so I dont think the assignment should be necessary for them. Im sure almost any student can complete said project with ease as wellÂ due to the amount of time given.Â",

      "Most schools in the United States require students to complete a summer project. Projects are assigned over the summer to assure students are learning over the long break. Most students want to enjoy their break without any school workÂ and wait until the last week of summer break to complete summer projects. This is why summer projects should be student-designed. If summer projects are student-designed, students will be more creative, it gives students a senses of independence, and students will be able to explore areas of interest.\n \n However, some may disagree and say summer projects should be teacher-designed. They argue for this because if projects are student-designed they may off topic. This is a valid argument because it would make no sense if a student in a science class did a project about Fredrick Douglass. This could be avoided if teachers made guidelines for students to follow. Nevertheless, their are other view points to consider.\n \n On the other hand, if summer projects were student-designed they would be more creative. Students would not be restricted and could express themselves in unique ways. In the last few decades or so, the government has made standards for students to meet. With theses standards in places teachers have to follow a very strict curriculum. More than ever before, teachers are teaching to the test which limits student creativity. With student-designed summer projects, students can express their creativity which they are limited to in the school year.\n \n In addition, allowing summer projects to be student-designed would let students to feel independent. As most students are restricted during the school year to a classroom, allowing students to design their own projects could mean they go to a local park and explore their community. In Tara Westover's memoir\n \n Educated , as a young girl she did not explore her community as a child due to her parents beliefs. As she grew up she wanted to go to college and experienceÂ something new. When she went to college it was very rewarding. This is because she was not restricted any more. Allowing students to design their own project could be a very rewarding feeling for them because of the independenceÂ they gain through it.\n \n Finally, if summer projects were to be student-designed it would allow students to explore areas of interest that may not correlate to a specific subject in school. If a student wanted to do a project about fast fashion, it does not make sense to do it in a world history, algebra, biology or band class. That is why it is beneficial to students if they design their own summer project. A student-designed summer project allows students to research a topic they might not be able to do in their classes during the school year.\n \n To conclude, letting students to design their own summer project is beneficial in more than one way. Students will be able to show off creativity that they might not show off in school. Student-designed projects gives students a sense of independence because they are not being told what to do. It also allows student to explore topics that are not taught in school. Student-designed projects have many benefits and could even lead to a careerÂ path in the future.",

    essay:
      "Sometimes over the summer, teachers will assign summer projects to students. This can put a damper on some students' summers and overall make them unhappy. However, if students were allowed to design their own summer projects it would improve upon their learning and enjoyment of their break.\n \n A lot of the time when students are assigned a project on something they don't know much about or aren't very interested in, they'll be less inclined to do the project. For example, in third grade, I entered the science fair. For the competition we were able to choose our topic rather than be assigned one. My partner and I were much more excited after finding out we could choose because that meant we would get to do our research on something we were interested and passionate about. Our passion drove us to get first place in the science fair. I don't think we would have worked as hard or been as diligent if we hadn't had the ability to choose. Another time I think of choice impacting achievement is in eighth grade. My English teacher conducted an experiment without telling any of her students. In the first quarter of the year she assigned us a paper that we could write about any topic of our choice. Later, in the third quarter, she assigned us a paper with a prompt. Even though we had learned more writing skills and were more skilled authors by the third quarter, most of the essay scores from the first quarter were better. She said just by reading the two different essays you could tell which subjects students were passionate about, and the grades reflected that. If students were able to design their own projects, they would be able to choose their topics, therefore inciting passion and improving upon grades.\n \n The main reason teachers assign summer projects is to add on to students' learning, right? Well, a lot of the time, if students are not interested in what they're learning, they're less prone to absorbing the information. Taking it back to my third grade science fair, a lot of my peers did a topic that their parents chose for them. Without that passion or drive behind their work, many of them did not take in any of the information they put on their tri-fold. My partner and I on the other hand, were very interested in our topic and wanted to learn as much as we could about it so we worked and studied hard. To this day I could still tell you how to make the best all natural carpet cleaner, and it was because we got to choose what our project was about. A more recent example from my life is my grades in my junior year courses. I'm personally enrolled in four classes this year, the two I see the biggest difference in grade are my film class and my math class. Film is a topic that I'm very interested in and makes me very happy. Math on the contrary, not so much. The two classes are polar opposites in the realm of stress vs. enjoyment, and my grades reflect that. It may have something to do with the course rigor, but in my opinion it has everything to do with interest and motivation. I'm much more inclined to do a film project because it brings me happiness while also engaging me and helping me receive good grades. When I look at a math assignment I'm nowhere near motivated to do it, which in turn brings down my mood and my grade because I don't put my all into the subject. Therefore I don't take in any of the information, whereas in my film class I could write you a paper on everything that we've learned since day one. Such is true for a majority of students; where interest and enjoyment peaks, so does information intake.\n \n If you ask the average student what their favorite time of year is, they'll probably answer summer. No school, warm weather, free time, fun. But when there's a project lingering over their head that they have no choice over and no interest in, it can really throw a wrench in their mood and plans. An unhappy student brews an unhappy school year, and I'm sure no teachers want that. Upon talking with many of my peers, I've come to realize that a summer assignment with no choice and no fun involved immediately creates resentment and a general dislike towards the class and the teacher involved. If students are obligated to do an boring project where the teacher has put strict guidelines, they're going to walk into the class with a preconceived notion of a boring, uninteresting course. This is going to weaken classroom morale and overall diminish scores and productivity in the classroom. However, if students are able to create their own project and do something their passionate about in relation to a course they're taking, it will ultimately make them excited to be in the class and increase their ability to succeed. I remember in my chemistry class last year, I was able to make videos for my labs. It made me excited every day to attend my science class and increased my desire to learn about chemistry. With choice comes happiness, with a happy summer comes a happy new school year.\n \n When it comes to summer projects and assignments, choice is always the route to follow. With a student-created project, students are more driven, ascertain more information, and overall have a better summer, which leads to a better school year. By comparing grades from class to class, paper to paper, or even just asking a student, it's not hard to conclude that with the ability to choose comes success in school.Â",

      "Obtaining a strong and rich education is a very valuable thing that many children across the world have access to. The school year can be very stressful due to a variety of different things, but summer is the gem that motivates many students to move forward. This three month break gives students an opportunity to prepare for the next school year, but the rate of learning during this time decreases. In order to continue a learning at a constant rate, schools have introduced summer projects. These summer projects can be designed by teachers who are interested, but can also be designed by students. Summer projects should be student-designed, because it encourages teamwork and spurs motivation.\n \n Learning how to work with other individuals is an extremely important quality. A student-designed summer project will encourage kids to communicate with one another in order to satisfy the project requests of the students as a whole. Also, communication can spur relationships and bonding among individuals. Working with others and using teamwork to achieve a certain goal creates unity. Next, teamwork is not only seen in school, but also seen in the workplace. As adults, knowing how to work together and have good communication skills with others can make ones work atmosphere more enjoyable. For example: doctors have to work together everyday to save others through sharing their knowledge and conversing with one another. Lastly, teamwork can create a decrease in social anxiety and an increase in social skills. Many students experience social anxiety while meeting new people and having conversations with others. Although anxiety can not be fully defeated, teamwork helps push kids with social anxiety to make new friends and bonds. Having students design a summer project results in more unity among the student body, social structure, and life skills for the future.\n \n Summer is a very popular time of year that is beloved by many people, especially kids. A student-designed summer project makes the perception of schoolwork in the summer more enjoyable. Having fun while doing something increases the likelihood of continuing the behavior. If a student enjoys the project they are working on, they are more likely to complete it and submit quality work. On the other hand, if the project was teacher-designed, students would most likely find the topic boring, procrastinate, and submit a poor project. A student-designed project assures that it is a topic students find fun and is more enjoyable when compared to a topic selected by a teacher. Next, having students pick their own topic also holds them more accountable to complete their work without complaints. Students who tend to procrastinate may be more motivated to complete a project that they enjoy. An enjoyable project will motivate students to do well and will not decrease the level of happinessÂ they have throughout theÂ summer.\n \n The brain is an endless archive of knowledge and memories that is always eager to learn more. Actively learning throughout the summer increases education and pushes children further on the path to success. A student-designed summer project results in the formation of unity among the student body and creates a structured work ethic.Â",

      'There is a concern that students come back to schoolÂ not being ready to learn. Matter of fact, according to\n \n Generic_City Times, 88% of students coming back from summer break are not mentally ready for school. Students and their families take vacations to free their mind off of school/work. Being off for three months for vacations/ free time, can be difficult for the students, as they come back to school. Students come back "rusty"Â orÂ not ready, because their mind is still set on having a good time with friends and not doing any homework. To solve this problem (of students not being ready for school), school boards are deciding to require summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. The question the school board is asking is, should summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Summer projects should be designed by the student because students will pick a topic of interest, will not get a topic that they don\'t like, and teachers may give students challenging projects students are not capable of doing.\n \n Picking your own topic for a summer project can lead to better grades. According to "Academic Awards", students achieved better grades when they work on a subject of choice. A student said at the awards, "When I got to write about Hockey, which is my favorite sport, I put so much effort and time into my paper. I loved to write about how great of a game Hockey is. I truly believe that if you are allowed to write about a topic that you have true passion for, it will lead to great success. This aspect does not only apply to school work, but also the real world." There have been many studies on how "doing the thing you love" will bring you great success. That same aspect goes with school, students learn and perform better when they are learning a subject of interest.\n \n Normally, students do not like the topic of research a teacher assigns. People who went through school know that we have always had projects/ papers that do not fit our interest. Students slack on this aspect because they do not have true passion into what they are writing (not interested) or learning. One student from Generic_School states, "My true passion was history, I loved to write about the challenges, wars, and new changes of the world. I was looking forward to writing papers about history because this is the topic that ultimately interested me, but when I had to write about a science paper, I had absolute no interest writing about it. I would make up excuses to myself on why I shouldn\'t write this paper." Teachers teach about mandatory subjects that are either boring or not interesting. If summer assigned projects are brought to the attention, then teachers should not give out their own idea of what the student has to complete.\n \n Not only do teachers pick uninteresting topics to research about, but they also pick topics that may be to challenging for the writer to complete. Teachers give out topics of study that are challenging for the student to learn about and can bring a student down (not wanting to complete the assignment). A student from Generic_City said, "If I got a paper that was teacher-designed and difficult, I would not be up to do it. We already had to go through a whole school year doing what they teacher wanted us to do, why can\'t we choose our own topic for the summer?" If a student gets a topic from a teacher that is to hard for them to achieve during summer, then they will procrastinate to finish it. Teachers have the whole school year to give out challenging projects to students, but for summer projects, a student should not be assigned hard and rigorous work.\n \n Students should design their own summer projects because they will value their project more, won\'t get a bad topic (get to choose own topic), and don\'t have to deal with challenging topics teachers hand out. There have been many factors that have been in place to deal with students not coming mentally prepared on the first day of school. Should summer be shortened? Should schools give out homework for students to complete during the summer, so learning will be longer lasting? At the end of the day, no matter what the belief is about school work being done over the summer, student should be able to design and apply their own project.Â',

      "Most students don't enjoy getting projects assigned to them to complete over summer break. If students got the opportunity to design their own projects, it may be a more enjoyable experience for the student. Students tend to forget information they've learned during the school year once summer hits. A way a number of schools attempt to prevent this situation is simply assign projects for students to complete over break. Students should have the choice to design their own projects for summer break because they are more likely to complete a project on a topic they enjoy and they will have better time management.\n \n There is a higher chance of students completing an assignment if they enjoy the topic the assignment is based on. When trying to complete a project students have no interest in, often times the motivation factor runs low. Low motivation tends to lead to unfinished projects. There is a greater chance students will complete a project they've self-designed because they will most likely be more interested and better engaged in the topic they have chosen for themselves. For example, like reading a book, a person that does not enjoy reading has a higher chance of enjoying a book if it is based upon a topic they are interested in.\n \n With a self-designed project, students will obtain better time management. During the summer, many students tend to have a packed schedule. Therefore, causes students to not make time for projects assigned to them. Leading to why having students create their own project, follows with the task of the project being completed. Better time management has a great chance of leading to a completed project. For example, a student that is joyful about an assignment they have toÂ complete, will make time for the project. Students then will have no excuse on why they couldÂ notÂ complete their projects because they have the ability to design it in a way that fits their schedule.\n \n Overall, many students don't enjoy getting assigned projects to complete over summer break. With the opportunity of getting to design their own project, might change how students feel about getting assigned work to complete. Students should have the opportunity to create their own projects for summer break because there is a greater chance the student will complete a project on a topic they are interested in and they will posses better time management.Â",

      "Summer projects are a great way to keep students learning over the summer. Some students may find them tedious, but they are actually very beneficial by keeping the students' minds working over their extended break. But, when teachers assign such projects, sometimesÂ they are not interesting nor engaging for the students. Thus, the interesting projects over summer break should be based on the student's interest in a subject, and not determined by a teacher, who may choose a topic that the student is not interested in.\n \n Often times during the school year, students take classes on subjects which they are not interested in in order to improve their college applications; this should not be the case for summer projects. The summer is a time for students to take a break from the rigorous math and English classes they took during the school year, and relax and do the things that they love. Therefore, to keep students engaged in their summer projects, they should determine what sort of work they do. For example, a person who has read all of the Percy Jackson novels would be very interested to learn about the classic Greek myths, and would greatly enjoy their spending a portion of their summer break reading Greek mythology. But if their English teacher assigned them a reading about the plight of the Native Americans, the student would likely not do the project until the last week of summer break, and would not retain any information and would receive a poor grade to start off the new school year. It is essential that a student researches what they like, and not something that is forced upon them by a previous teacher of theirs.\n \n At Generic_School, ninth-grade students were assigned a summer reading about the civil war, in which many students did not do, and thus started off the school year with a poor grade. They were not interested in the subject and thus did not want to waste a portion of their summer break doing something they do not enjoy. Some students did well on it, though, and that is where the issue is. An individual student would likely receive a grade for this project based on their interest in the subject, instead of their abilities as to do research and make a final product out of it. This is because those who were interested in the civil war or who had abundant previous knowledge of it would get a one-hundred percent on the project because they were either very interested in it or did not have to do any research to write the essay. Those who were interested were motivated to learn about it and did lots of research. On the other hand, there were students who did not care for researching the Civil War as they did not find it interesting. Some of those students were the brightest in the class, and received a poor grade. The issue is that teacher-assigned summer projects cater to the interest of few, if any, of the students in a certain class, which causes grade discrepancies based on previous knowledge and interest, rather than ability to perform a task. Thus, if each student could choose their own topic to research over summer break and have the teacher approve it, there would be less unfair grade discrepancies between students of equal intelligence.\n \n Research projects are of the utmost importance in the later stages of student life, thus students should learn how to write a good paper early on in their careers, and there is no better way to do that than to have them research a topic they are intrigued by. As previously mentioned, many students who were not interested by the topics assigned by teachers would often times not do the project or do the whole thing the night before school starts, and thus start the year off with a horrible grade. There is a more long-term effect of this issue, though. summer projects are not assigned solely for the purpose of learning the material, teachers also want students to learn how to research 3ly and write good essays. In order to do this most 3ly, though, the students must have an interest in the topic, and if their topic is their choice, they will pick one that peaks their interest and will most likely perform better on it compared to a topic which they did not choose. This will improve their essay writing and research abilities in the future, and help create a more interested and intelligent student body.\n \n To conclude, students who are required to complete summer projects should be allowed to choose the topic they will research over the summer. Summer break is a time for relaxation and fun for students, thus when they must work it should be interesting, and allowing students to choose their own topics for research would make each individual more involved in their work. The issue with teacher assigned summer projects is that they cause grade discrepancies between students of equal intelligence based on their previous knowledge of a subject. Grade discrepancies should derive from a student's ability to perform the task at hand, and not their previous knowledge or interest in the subject, and that is what happens with teacher-assigned summer projects. Finally, students develop research skills when they do well on a research project, and having students pick a topic interesting to them will increase their chances of doing well.",

      "Summer projects are a good idea to keep student's active and learning throughout the summer. They can be beneficial for some core classes such as math, history, and english, but can also be tedious and stressful during a break that should be relaxing. Haiving good intentions in mind, teachers creating summer projects for challenging courses try to make them doable and a low intesity learning experience. Even so, it does not always seem that way to the students who dread them and push them off until the last week of summer. Summer projects should be student designed because it is the students' learning, their grade is dependent upon the work, and sometimes a teacher will present too much work.\n \n Whether or a not a student wants to learn is completely their choice, and they will deal with the positive and negative effects. For example, some students think that having a summer project for a challenging course is pointless because they will likely just forget everything by the start of the school year. This can prove to be true, or it can lead to their struggling grades and other consequences. Very few people actually want to do work over summer break, so it is up to the student to decide what is important to them and how they want to prepare for school. Some students do well with shorter reviews, while others need long practices to relearn what they did not understand. Students should design summer projects so that they can customize them to their individual needs.\n \n Along with the negative consequences a student must understand that their grade in the class is dependent upon how much work they do over them summer, so designing the summer project would be beneficial in helping them improve. Most classes that require summer assignments start off the in the first quarter with an assumption that they students completely understand the material that was supposed to be covered over the summer. With most classes, a student will skip around the summer asignment and just try to do the things they need to work on, jumbling knowledge up in their head as they try to organize themselves. Understanding what they need to work on, the students can design a summer projet that would help in areas of weakness in hopes of improving their school grades. This will be helpful in the future because the students can individually learn and then bring what they have learned throughout the summer back to the classroom and help others.\n \n Lastly, in designing summer projects, teachers tend to compile a ton of needless work that none of the students do. For instance, in an AP class the teacher usually thinks that they more you practice the better you will get, which is usually true. Because of this mindset they will put together pages of practice tests, and notes for a student to complete throughout the summer causing absolute chaos and a huge amount of stress. Despite practice making perfect, no one wants to fill out papers over the summer. Since the students know their workload from other classes and what they are capable of, they can put together a decent amount of work that is not too long. If the students were to design summer projects they would be more inclined to do them because it would not be such a tedious amount of work.\n \n Even though teachers make summer projects because they design the learning plan for the year, students would get much more out of them if they made them together because of the learning aspect that comes with it. Students should design them because they would be able to identify their weaknesses collectively, and create practices that would help them in the future. This is much better than teachers compiling useless, terrifying tests from randomn websites that are pushed off until the last week of summer.",

      "Summer! Often described as a time to sit back and relax, a summer vacation can be seen as the antithesisÂ to any opportunity for learning. However, summer projects allow for learning to continue throughout the year. Summer projects should be student driven, due to the fact that they allow for self-motivation and individualism, as long as teachers are able to monitor the progress and quality of the work being done.\n \n A teacher-designed summer project does not allow for the same amount of individualism that could stem from a project designed by a student. Giving specific requirements for a summer project for an entire class of students will produce a number of cookie-cutter responses with no variety from student to student. This is because forcing students to fit into a mold limits any possible chance of self-expression. The entire point of creativity is to be outside of the norm, but that is impossible with a teacher-designed project, because 'the norm' is exactly what it is designed for.\n \n Furthermore, in a standard educational setting, students are not able to pick and choose what interests them, and this can lead to a lack of motivation during the normal school year. Finding a subject that one is passionate about is integral to continuing the joy of learning and of new discoveries that is so often lost in the later years of formal education. This is not anÂ issueÂ for student-designed summer projects.Â Allowing students to pick what interests them for a summer project would solve this issue. With no parameters set by teachers, the educational possibilities are endless for a student.\n \n However, regardless of how much a student is willing to learn on their own during summer vacation with a student-based project, teachers still have their place in this system. Checks and balances are necessary for any system like this to function, and summer projects are no different. Some parametersÂ for these summer projects should be set by teachers. Otherwise, there is no way to ensure that actual learning is taking place during what is supposed to be a learning experience. Teachers also need to have the ability to grade any given project, which would be difficult to do objectively if no parameters were given to the projects.\n \n Learning does not stop at the end of high school, and it certainly does not stop at the end of a school year. Student-designed projects allow for creativity and individualism from each and every student, and allowing teachers to have a guiding-but not controlling-hand in the projects can lead to fantastic academic results.Â",

      "Did you know the 75% of high school studentsÂ do their summer assignments in the last week of the summer. Some even do it in the first week of school. This percent would decrease if the students projects were self chosen. It would help them by giving them the choice of doing what they want to do. They would be able to be more creative, be able to do it faster so they can enjoy their summer and some families money is a struggle and they can't afford the teacher directed projects so they can do what works for them.\n \n When a project is student directed they have the freedom to do what they want and be creative with it and actually enjoy doing the project. I have had hundreds of projects in my eleven years of schooling and some of my favorite ones were in my cooking class last year. My favorite one in that class was a food truck project. My teacher said you have to make a cardboard box food truck, make a menu, and make one item on the menu. Otherwise we were free to do what we wanted. I ended up making some really good food because she said just do what you want. I alsoÂ ended up getting a good grade because I could be creative on that project.\n \n One major problem with summer assignments is that students either forget about them and don't do them or they pushÂ them off until the last minute. I am one of those students that procrastinates until the last minute to do my AP summer assignments. It makes it very challenging to do them when there is only one week in summer left and I want to have fun and enjoy the last parts of the summer. I have friends that are worse than me and either don't do the AP work at all or they do them at the beginning of the school year, but if they were self chosen they would not have the issue of not wanting to do them because they can do what ever they want and make it what they feel is good.\n \n My final reason is more on the extreme side but I have seen it happen. It is where the teachers summer work is a large project that is simple but costly and some families that I have seen do not have enough money to do the project. They normally end up failing the project because they never did the work, but if they could do what they want for it they could've passed. Where if they were short on money and it was limiting them on what they could do if they needed to they could do a less expensive project and save their money for other things.\n \n There are many other reasons that students should be able to do their own thing for their projects over the summer but here are just a few of the reasons that people say that they should remain teacher directed. It's that it is a lot easier for the teacher to grade based on what they are looking for because they can grade on their scale of how close it is to what they want. But when it is student choice they can be creative and have fun, the project can go faster and they can enjoy their summer for what is it and it can be more cost 3 for the families that have lower incomes.",

      'Summer projects should be student-designed as long as the teacher is still in control of the overall process. This system engages the students more, while also ensuring that they continue to learn over the break.\n \n As a rule, students are more likely to complete an assignment and enjoy doing so if they have control over the parameters of the assignment. If a student is interested in a certain field of study, they should be able to freely explore and learn about it. Designing their own assignment would allow them to do this. For example, one student might be fascinated with astronomy and another student with biology. Allowing them to create their own projects to study these fields would pique their interest in learning and may also help them understand which career field might suit them best.\n \n However, with a student-designed project, it is possible that the student will "slack off" and design a project that does not truly benefit their learning. For example, a student might design a science experiment that with the research question of "what is the effect of temperature on ice?" Although this question sounds valid, it is not since it is easily answered. Most people already know that ice melts as the temperature increases. Therefore, the student will not have to put in much effort or even conduct the experiment in order to know the outcome.\n \n In order to prevent this from happening, teachers should supervise the designing of these projects. This can be done before the students leave school for the summer or the students can submit project proposals to the teacher over the summer. If teachers do this, they will be able to verify that their students\' projects are possible and refine them. Often times, students have good ideas, but do not know how to execute them or are unable to because they do not have the necessary resources. Teachers will also be able to catch the projects that are too "obvious" or easy.\n \n Although student-designed projects can go awry, they can also be very successful if they are created with the guidance of a teacher. Students should be given every opportunity to learn on their own and explore their individual passions.Â Â Â Â',

      "Summer homework, one of the most scary phrases said by any teacher. Many schools and teachers require projects to be completed over the Summer to keep topics fresh in students minds while the students are on break. While this train of thought does make sense, these projects should be designed by the students. It is unreasonable to think that students should work around the teachers schedule during the summer, as if they hadn't been doing that the entire school year. Student designed assignments would allow the children to continue their learning while still being able to go on vacation and work at their jobs. It would also allow them to become more engaged with what they are learning, as they would be be in the drivers seat of their learning, making it more enjoyable. It would also let the teachers get a better understanding of their students and where their level of comprehension is with a certain topic. Student designed projects would allow for the students to learn, while also allowing them to have fun during their break.\n \n Typically, when teachers assign homework over the break, they schedule due dates and assignments when it is beneficial to them, and not quite as much as the students. Giving the power to the students to make their own time lineÂ to help alleviate the stress of the projects, makes the assignments seem like less of a chore and helps them learn the content. A couple years ago, a teacher of mine assigned our class three books to be read over the summer. The first book had to be read by the end of June along with a quick report. Too bad for me, I was in Italy with my family, that I hadn't seen for a year, for the month. During the vacation I was barely able to spend time with my family as I was trying to read the assigned book and write a report. Because of this teacher designed summer assignment, I missed quality family time and rushed to finish my report. These restraints that wouldn't have happened if the schedule was student designed, caused me to not learn anything because I was too rushed, and also made me lose time with my family. If students were able to design a schedule for their assignments this would take away the stress that comes along with set due dates.\n \n Another thing many teachers like to do, is to assign \"busy work.\" Teachers assign busy work just to be able to say that the students are learning and working. During the Summer, Teachers often assign busy work to meet the schools requirement of a summer project. Often times this includes long packets, that students simply have to complete. They are extremely time consuming and non beneficial to the children. For example, let's say a science teacher requires the students to complete a project on the different bird species of the region. One student might really benefit from a book about the birds and learn from it, but another student is more of a visual learner. With a student designed project, the first student could read his book about the specific birds, while the other creates a project on the different species he sees around his neighborhood while documenting what he sees. Summer projects shouldn't all be the same, because everyone is different. If students were able to control how they were learning, everyone would be able to create a project that works best for them, which makes it easier to understand what they need to learn.\n \n Many might think, that the teachers don't benefit from student designed projects, and this plan just reverses the stress to the teachers. But, not only would student made projects be beneficial to the children, it would also be beneficial to the teachers as well. Student made projects would allow teachers to gauge where each students level of comprehension of a certain subject/topic is and where each student needs a little extra help. Let's say a history teacher lets their students create a project about the government branches. One student writes about all of the branches of government but leaves out the fact that the President is a part of the Executive branch from their project. The teacher now knows what they should review in the upcoming school year. Since the project is in control by the students they are able to learn what they want and how they want, this freedom allows the teachers to help the students learn even further as they now have a better understanding of what the children's strengths and weaknesses are. While these students were learning about history their teacher was learning about them.\n \n Leaving the students in charge of their summer assignments, benefits all those involved, from the teachers to the students. It lets students feel more relaxed during the break while also allowing them to learn at their own pace and more 3ly. It allows the teachers to get a better understanding of where their students are so theyÂ can grow as teachers by knowing what the kids struggle with and how to improve in the future.\n \n So, if teachers are required to give students Summer assignments, hand the keys to the kids and let them drive.",

    essay:
      "Over the summer, many student spend their time doing nothing to keep their minds active and engaged in education. Many schools and teachers want children to continue creating learning experiences and mentally developing over the summer. One way they can do this is to assign a summer project for a student. While many of these projects might be created and outlined by the teacher, I personally think that Students should design and create their own individual projects because it would help them to grow as independent learners, it would allow them to create something that they would be enthusiastic about and would put more effort into. and it would also help the teacher see more clearly how 3ly a student is progressing as a learner.\n \n One important reason that summer projects should be student designed is the fact that creating a whole project from scratch would help a child to become a far more independent learner, and would prepare them for their later stages in life. When a student reaches college, it would be pretty overwhelming for them to have to take a bunch of classes that were all almost completely independent if they had never been given the opportunity to grow in their independence as a person in middle or high school. A student designed project might be quite scary for many students, but I think that it is definitely necessary in order to be set up for long term success in their personal endeavors throughout their later years in education, as well as their career afterwards. Many jobs are highly independent and require for somebody to be diligent in their own efforts. For example, my dad is an engineer, and he has deadlines that are agreed on by him and the people that pay him for completing work for them, and if he doesnt meet a deadline, the client would most likely not be happy and never come back to get more work done from him.\n \n Another big reason that summer projects should be student made is that it would allow for students to be more creative, and work on something that they are very enthusiastic about, which would in turn make it easier for the student to work hard and do well on the project. If a student is assigned a topic that they completely hate, they would be extremely unenthusiastic about the project, and would definitely not want to work on it, especially during the summer months, when there are so many other things they would rather be doing. It would probably lead to procrastination on a project that would leave a student with not enough time to properly do the project to the best of their abilities. A project that a student is enthusiastic about could also lead to a student feeling confident in their abilities, and they would be encouraged to try their best and do well throughout the year to keep their positive momentum flowing.\n \n It would also be extremely helpful for a teacher to be able to see how a student is functioning and is progressing on their own terms. At the end of the day, the teachers job is to guide and lead us until we are independent enough to thrive on our own. If the projects were self designed, it would be an extremely helpful tool for future teachers to look back on and guage how much work a student needs on their independence journey before they can leave without facing struggle or uncertainty throughout their life. These self designed projects would help a teacher to clearly see each level of assistance needed by each and every student.\n \n All of these reasons that argue that projects should be student designed revolve around one thing: independence. I think that independence is the single most important thing that you have to prepare for in order to be ready for college. If a student was not independent in college, they would flounder around without being able to properly learn and develop the skills they need to succeed after college. Middle and High schools need to take steps towards challenging their students with independence to create self-sustaining, educated people that can truly help to make a positive difference throughout their communities and make the world a better place.",

      "As the school year ends and summer break begins, many students cease to learn or do any education-related activities. Some schools require their students to complete summer projects to assure that the students continue to learn over the duration of their three-month summer break; however, there has been an ongoing debate on whether these summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Those who disagree state that these summer projects should be designed by the teachers, but this not true. Although some may disagree, the summer projects that some schools are requiring students to complete should be student-designed.\n \n There are a variety of reasons that the summer projects that some schools are requiring students to complete should be student-designed. One reason that these projects should be designed by the students is that by allowing students to design their own projects, the students are able to demonstrate their ambiguity. For example, a student may have interests in a particular subject and may do a project that is displayed through an ambiguous media platform. That project format would not be able to be displayed if the projects were designed by the teachers. Another reason that these projects should be designed by the students is that by allowing students to design their own projects, the students are able to be creative with their projects. A student may want to be creative and show their ability to carve marble statues, or their ability to do ventriloquism. In another instance, a student may want to be creative with their project topic and may want to conduct research on a rarely known species of insects that they learned about while visiting South America during their summer vacation. In addition to the aforementioned reasons, students should be able to design their own projects because it allows students to learn more about a topic that interests them. A teacher designed project may inquire about a student's knowledge of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus or Newton's Laws; however, these topics wouldn't interest many students and the amount of precision and thought put into the projects would be lackluster. By allowing a student to control their project's topic, the teachers are giving the students freedom to roam and think about what they are going to learn about.\n \n There are further reasons that the summer projects that some schools are requiring students to complete should be student-designed. When a teacher allows a student to choose a topic for a project, it allows the teachers to understand a student's level of learning, as well as a student's level of thinking. Most students will be appreciative of the fact that they're able to conduct a project of their choice and will give their best effort while completing the project. As a teacher grades a student's project, that teacher is able to gauge what the student was thinking as they created their project. Another reason that these projects should be designed by the students is that when a student is given the freedom to conduct their own research for a project topic, that student is able to give a demonstration of their innovation. Many students have strong innovation skills, but during the school year they are assigned different assignments that prohibit students from using their innovative nature. For example, if a student has an interest in airplanes, they may want to do a project pertaining to airplanes; teacher-designed projects would not allow a student to explore this area of innovation within themselves, which may cause them to lose interest in the topic. One more reason that the projects should be student-designed is that by conducting one's own research and designing one's own project, a student may explore new topics that may peak their interest. For example, while researching the hardships and difficulties of underwater welding, a student may learn about another profession that they did not know existed. This simple occurrence may sway a multitude of that student's life choices: which major they will pursue in college, which profession they may want to pursue after college, or if that student may still want to go to college after high school instead of going to a trade school.\n \n Although some may disagree, the summer projects that some schools are requiring students to complete should be student-designed. Those who disagree state that the summer projects that some schools are requiring students to complete should be teacher-designed, but there are a plethora of reasons that this is false. These projects should be student-designed for a multitude of reasons: students are able to be more creative and ambiguous when choosing their own project design, students are able to be more innovative when choosing their own project design, students are given the opportunity to learn about new topics, and when students are given the chance to design their own project, teachers are able to gauge students' thinking and cognitive skills levels. By allowing a student to design their own project, that student is bound to become a more independent thinker and innovator; thus, creating a brighter future for the generations to come.",

    essay:
      "When summer finally begins, the last thing a student even considers thinking about is anything that is school related. The infamous summer project stands to change that. This topic, the summer project, coupled with my predetermined ideologies to what summer should represent lead me to the conclusion that if summer projects are to be a requirement for students, they should be designed by the student, for the student. The reasons students should have the right to design their own projects include, but are not limited to, the fact that giving students a say would let them express, and learn about, themselves creatively, the fact that students can make something they are passionate about, and the idea that summer is not a time to be doing school work.\n \n If students acquire the right to design their own summer projects, they would most likely make the project in a manner that would be both fun and educational at the same time. This is exactly what I did in the 10th grade, when I was assigned a video project in the class Driver's Education. I had never recorded a video for school purposes, and I never learned to edit either. The video project made learning to edit a necessity. I not only learned how to edit because of the video, but I also learned that making and editing videos can be extremely fun! It showed me that I love to make people laugh, and honestly, I may want to pursue making and editing videos one day. Students could choose a video project, or any other way to channel their creativity through this project. In doing so, in choosing how the project is designed, they may learn something new about themselves, and it gives students a chance to show, or maybe even find, their creative side.\n \n By giving students the right to design their own summer projects, you are giving students the chance to make something with the passions they have. This would have an extremely positive effect, as they would now be working on the project with an unconventional mindset, at least in the context of school work. This change in their mindset would make it easier for the project to be done, as the unique things each student loves are being incorporated. This would also drastically increase the quality of work, as they are doing something they love. Allowing students to incorporate their passions would also show teachers how each student is unique in their own way. Student designed summer projects may also create a new interest for whatever topic the project is on, as students would be more inclined to make a cocktail of their interests and school-related topics rather than isolating the two.\n \n Over the 10 months that make up the school year, students are in a constant state of stress, due in part by the work that they must do. Summer is a time for students to unwind, and to forget what it means to be a stressed out, overworked, and sleep deprived student. A time to relax. A time, for once in a student's life, to put the work, and the stress that comes with it, down for an extended period of time. If students are to be required to complete a summer project, they should, at the very least, have a choice in how they will design said project. As it will ease the sting of having to do school work in a time where no school work should be done in the first place. One may say, \"Anytime is a time to do school work!\" And while I see where they are coming from, school is out of session for a reason. Summer vacation is a time to be away from school and all of the psychological endeavors it brings with it. Which is why I know, definitively, that school work should not be issued out during the summer in the first place, and because of this, if school work is to be issued, the school, at the very least, should give the students the right to design their summer projects.\n \n In conclusion, students, without a shadow of a doubt, should be given the right to design their summer projects. Through designing their summer projects, students can learn about who they are creatively, they can incorporate what they are passionate about into the summer project, and finally, students can feel better about having to do a project during the summer, as they will at least have a choice in what that project is. All of these benefits are extremely valuable, as they will have a positive effect towards a student's life, as they can learn new things about themselves, and show people a bit of who they are. These positive effects would be an impossibility if the flexibility that comes from giving students the right to design their summer projects is not given in the first place. Â Â Â  Â Â Â",

      "Most students try their best to avoid learning over the summer. As a result, they forget the knowledge they learned in the prior school year and aren't prepared for the upcoming school year. To get used to learning again, student's brains need to be refreshed and stimulated in the beginning of every school year.\n \n As an attempt to solve this problem, teachers assign summer projects. Students, often times, despise these projects because they are boring and stressful. However, these projects are neccessary because they ensure students don't forget about school. To make the projects more enjoyable for students, they should design the projects instead of teachers. Student-designed projects would be better because they focus on their interests, have higher quality, and be less stressful.\n \n In most cases, students don't find school work interesting because the topics aren't based around things students care about. Students get tired of learning about the same meaningless things that have no value in their lives. The things they are taught in school can't be applied to the real world and are based around a broken system that focuses on grades and memorization, not learing. Student-designed projects would focus on their interests. Students would actually want to learn compared to falling asleep in their history class listening to something that happened 900 years ago. Students could assign themselves a project based on a book they enjoy or a phenonom they find mysterious. Students would work and have fun doing it. The projects would still be educational and purposeful, but students wouldn't feel forced to do it.\n \n It is a known fact that if people love what they do, they will put more effort into it. When people don't enjoy their work, they don't care as much and don't try as hard. This concept can be applied to student-designed projects. For once, students would be excited to work and learn because they get the chance to do something their passionate about. Students would put more effort into their projects. As a result, their quality of work and overall project would be much better compared to if they had to work on a teacher-designed project. They would get higher grades and teachers would be impressed with their work.\n \n School is extremely stressful for students throughout the school year. The workload is intense and hard to manage. Teachers give difficult test and assign massive piles of homework that students have to complete for typically seven classes. Students feel pressure to attain good grades. This can lead to terrible sleep patterns, mental breakdowns, and anxiety attacks. Outside factors can also add to their stress. Students have to deal with their social and family problems, which can be emotionally traumatizing. Students also partake in clubs and sports or have jobs that just add to their workload. Summer is a much needed break for students because they can escape from the stress that the school year brings. On their break, the last thing students want is another stressful project. Student-designed projects would reduce their stress significantly. They wouldn't feel as much pressure to meet their teachers standards and would wouldn't procrastinate as much. Student-designed projects would encourage learning for students without incorporating the factor of stress that comes along with school work.\n \n Some might say that student-designed projects wouldn't focus on real topics or be taken seriously by the students. However, teachers could approve the designs to make sure they are educational. Teachers can also grade the projects like teacher-designed projects to make sure students don't blow the project off. Students will enjoy these projects much more because they can have fun with it. These projects will also help them learn over the summer break and prepare them for the school year. Student-designed projects are much better than teacher-designed projects because they focus on the students interests, increase their quality of work, and take away stress. Student-designed summer break projects should be implemented into more school systems around America.Â  Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â  Â Â Â Â",

      "A lot of schools in America require students to do summer projects to make sure they are exercising their knowledge during the 3 month break, some schools believe they should let the students choose the projectÂ they are going to complete, some schools believe they should let the teachers decide what the students will do.\n \n I believe the students should decide what the project will be, because the summer should be a time where students are taking their break off from school, so the teachers might give the students a really hard and long project that takes a lot of effort to do not knowing how it feels like, so i believe the school should get ideas for what project they will be giving out to the students from the students, choose their favorites from that list so the students dont pick something that is too easy and gives them barely any knowledge out of it, and then let the students vote for what they want to do.\n \n An example of this is at a school in Dubai, where they placed a closed box in every class and let everybody get a peice of paper, write their idea down, fold it and then put the folded peice of paper inside the box,than they open all of these boxes and pick 50 different prompts, then they make a survey and make every student vote for what they want to do out of these 50 different prompts, the one with the most votes gets chosen.\n \n In conclusion, every school should let the students control some of the decisions made, it gives them more freedom and makes them feel like they have a say on whats going on in their lives instead of letting other people decide for them.",

      "Many schools require students to do projects in the summer. These projects can be designed by teachers or students. The projects are created so the student can continue to learn over their break; but can become a problem if the student doesn't like the type of project given to them by the teacher. This is why students should be able to design their own projects. Students should be able to design their own project because they will be able to be more creative and comfortable; but teachers should design the project simply because the teacher is more knowledgeable than the student when it comes to the topic.\n \n First, when students can design their own project, they will be more creative and will be more likely to show what they know. The student being more creative on their project will show that that they understand the topic and don't have to follow a simple and easy format. For example, personally, I have had summer projects like my \"Of mice of men\" book project that was just flat out boring and not fun because the teacher gave us no room to be creative in anyway. Many students want to be creative with their projects, but when the project doesn't look appealing or will not let us be creative, we don't get a very good chance to show what we know. Then compared to my personal reading book project, where I had the freedom of being able to be creative and could show my understanding of the book. It showed the difference between being able to designing your own project or being given a teacher designed, simple project.\n \n Furthermore, personally, when a teacher has given me a specific format; there is the feeling of uneasy because I feel if I don't follow the format, the project will be completely wrong. This example doesn't let the student feel comfortable and makes the student feel that they can't be creative in their own way. When a student gets the chance to design their own projects, the students will naturally be more comfortable. This can be shown by the students work and effort put into their projects. Being comfortable with a project for the students is a big deal because if the students don't feel comfortable, how will the students show what they have learned during their projects. A student designed project helps because it is based off of what they want to do and not something they were given.\n \n Although, when the teachers design the projects, the teachers will know more on the topic rather than the students. This can make it to where the teachers specifically designs the projects to the topic of choice. Since the teachers design the projects, they can create and use different kinds of formats. The teachers can also choose the type of projects the students can use. This can and will give the students more options on their projects than just one, and the students can choose the type of projects based on their strengths and weaknesses. Since the teachers know more on the topic of the projects they can use that to be creative themselves by designing a project for the students that isn't something most of the students have seen before.\n \n In conclusion, since many schools require students to do projects over the course of summer. Students should be able to design their own projects based off of them being able to be more creative and being more comfortable; but teachers should design the projects simply because the teacher is more knowledgeable than the student on the topic. Work shows when a student is comfortable with their project. When they're comfortable the can aslo become more creative. After all of these statements and supporting evidence this is why students should be able to design their own summer projects.",

      "Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Summer projects should be student-designed to keep it simple. Teacher-designed projects are usually time consuming, boring, and complicated. The summer projects should be fun, easy, and less time consuming for students. Students wouldn't want to do a project that could take up their entire summer break; they don't deserve it. The summer projects should be student-designed because they are able to decide how much time they want to spend on it and how easy or creative they want it to be.\n \n Summer break is the time students are off from school. If they were to have teacher-designed projects, it'll make them feel like their still in school. Students are supposed to enjoy summer break, not be focused on a project given by a teacher that could stress them out. Most times, students don't do the project at all for reasons like: \" Oh it's boring\", \" I didn't have time\", \" I couldn't understand it\", or \" It's too much work\". Teacher-designed projects are not right for students, especially since it's over the summer.\n \n Student-designed projects will allow students to have an enjoyable summer. If they create their own project, they have control on what they do. Students will still be learning by themselves with what they decide to create. If the student does not want to spend the whole summer working on the project, it will be okay because they're the one making the decisions. The students can make their project easy and fun with things like: Colors, Pictures, and Glitter. Students will be able to enjoy their summer break because their project will be fun and easy for them.\n \n Everyone has their own opinion for these two choices. If it were to be discussed by teachers only, they would most likely choose teacher-designed projects. If it were to be discussedÂ by students only, they would most definitely choose students-designed projects. Between teachers and students discussing it, it would basically be a 50/50, but the teachers should really give students the chance to create something and learn on their own. It's best for the summer projects to be students-designed to have it easy on them.Â Â",

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects as a way to make sure they are still learning during their time off. To some students this sounds not ideal because if their getting a break from school then why would they want still be responsible for school work. While others may like keeping their mind stimulated while they are on break. Even in both cases the projects being required should be able to be student-designedÂ projects. Most students like having a choice of assignments or work so they can pick whats best suited for them and their strengths. The student-design offers more to the student then the teacher-design because the students are the ones who have the greater idea on what they are doing. Student-designed projects would get the students more interested in the projects which then more students would complete the assignment in its entirety.\n \n Being interested in a particular subject or idea would most likely increase the effort and time you put in to what pertains to the subject. Even thought its during the summer more students would completeÂ a assignment that appeals to their interests rather then a standard project that teachers have assigned for years. For example if a student who likes Rap or Hip-Hop music is assigned to a research paper about all the major wars that the United States fought in they might not feel an appeal to do the project or at least not put in a lotÂ of effort in ; if that same student was allowed to research the same topic but create is own song or rap about it would increase the interest about the project and the effort put in. There would be guidelines and rules about how the student can complete the assignment and the subject matter but as a overall the project would be student design based. Although some students might not have a preference on any type of assignment or if the teacher assigns everyone one universal project most would use their interest to create a project they would enjoy doing. Letting student summer projects be student-design would increase the interest in the project.\n \n Students are going to to what they want in most cases so making the summer projects student design based will help have larger completion rate of projects. If what a student is being told to do is not something they agree with they will most likely not do it or turn it in or halfway complete it so it is not to its full potential. However if a choice is given or if the project is student design based it will more likely get done and done well. As an example if the teacher design based project was a four page paper then more then likely people are not going to do it because writing is not their personal strong suit, but if their was a choice of a four minute video project about the same same topic it gives student who have different abilities to excel just as much as others in their own personal way. While the student design will increase the amount of students who do the project their will always be students who just don't do it but at least for the students who do it,Â a bigger outlet is givenÂ so they can complete it in a way they they can understand or what they excel in. The student design gives student a bigger window so it can help them complete the assignment and have it done well.\n \n Student-designed projects would get the students more interested in the projects which then more students would complete the assignment in its entirety. The projects assigned are ultimately for the benefit of the student in the long run so having the assignment be student based would greater benefit the student. Some think that since the teachers are mastered in their subject matter it should be a teacher design based project but then the student might feel smothered or boxed in by how they feel about the whole project in general which would be doingÂ the opposite of benefiting the student. A student design based project would be the best way for the student so succeed.Â  Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

      "School is stressful. Not only during the school year but now during the summer. From extracurricular activities to preparing for the upcoming year, the summer can also be a time of stress. Students from all over America are forced to participate in summer projects designed to reinforce the information they learned during the school year. While this idea makes perfect sense, one must evaluate how these projects are designed. Summer projects should be student designed because this can improve creativity and eliminate stress; although one could argue that eliminating structure would result in a poor learning opportunity, teachers must think positively about every student's potential.\n \n In school, almost every project is teacher-designed. This occurs so that teachers can assess a set of skills a student can perform. However, implementing a student-designed project would help students find their true passion in a field and help them become more creative individuals. For instance, when a student is forced to create a science experiment on a specific wild plant, there is no creativity involved in selecting what to study. However, if a student could choose which plant to study and what experiment to do, it could improve a student's creative thinking skills. This student-designed project would also help students find their passion for science by having them discover a plant that truly interests them. Summer projects should be student-designed because of the increased creativity and innovation when students can choose what to study.\n \n Nowadays, stress is apparent with almost every student. The stress of pleasing teachers is often what forces students into a hatred towards school. When a teacher designs a project for a student to complete, it can turn a potentially fun learning opportunity into a dreadful and stressful assignment. For instance, if a student is forced to complete a history project on Abraham Lincoln, a student may see this as just another thing to be completed. However, if a student is given the opportunity to complete a history project on any president, he/she may find it entertaining to research one of their favorite people in history. This can greatly benefit the student because many students learn best when they are not stressed out about a specific goal. The lack of stress causes them to have a relaxed time while still obtaining valuable knowledge.\n \n While summer projects are valuable to ensure that students have retained information, they should not be teacher-designed. The summer should be a time where students can choose what to work on in order for them to truly find their passion. This can help to improve a student's creativity by allowing them to participate in an activity they are truly interested in. Similarly, this can help a student to eliminate stress by finding enjoyment in their project.Â",

Some schools think kids should still have projects throughout the summer to continue their learning. Each school is different, some schools have the teachers come up with the project, while others lets the students make it. Schools should have teacher-designed projects for the summer because it would get students ready for what they will learn that year, teachers could count it as a grade once school starts, and it would be an easy project that would not take too long to do.\n \n If a teachers got to come up with the project they make it on the one of the topics the students would learn that year. They know what they will be teaching, so they would make the projects on specific units to prepare you for the class. Doing this is great because it will get the students ready and interested into the subject early on. This will help the students for when they start school they will already know a littleÂ about the topic. The more students know to start with the better they might do in the class.\n \n Another great thing is if the teacher designed the project, then they could count the project as a grade to get the school year started. This is good because right off the bat the student could have a good grade if they do the project correctly. Knowing this more people, for sure, would do the project. Starting the year off with a good grade can help benefit you later on, if you start to struggle a little bit. The project would be easy, so it would be easy to get a good grade, which is a great way to start a school year with. The more students doing the project, the more students you will have thinking and getting involved in school during the summer.\n \n The teachers would make it a fairly easy project that would not take the whole summer to do. Summer is the teachers vacations as well, and they know as much as the kids do that they want to relax. Lots of kids travel and hangout with friends during summer and teachers know that, so they would make it a pretty fair and easy project. Doing projects like these kids get more involved and excited to do them. If teachers did a simple, and maybe even a little fun, project it would keep the kids thinking and yet not stressed out.\n \n Some might say that the students should design the project. They think this because they say the students could make it their own and they would be more interested if they got to choice what they wanted to do. Although some people say that, if a student got to choice their topic or how they want to do their project they would do it too easy for themselves.

      "Imagine summer break coming to an end you would want to make memories with friends and family, but you can't because you have to do your summer project. When it comes to summer assignments many students will put it off until the last moment. They will do this for a number of reasons maybe they were on vacation, had trouble with their family, or just didn't like the assignment. Regardless of the reason in the last moments of summer they must rush to complete this assignment for the next school year. Summer projects should be student-designed because of students interest, schedules, and emotional health.\n \n Summer assignments should be student-designed because of different students interest. Some students may be interested in math while others might like scienceÂ or history more. If a student likes math but is required to do a history summer assignment they will not want to do it because they are not motivated to do something they do not like. Some may say that regardless of what classes students like they will do the assignment anyways because they have to. While that is true it would be better to let the students choose what they want instead of trying to force them to continue learning over summer break.\n \n Students schedules are not always as simple as teachers think so giving a lot of work to do over the summer might not be best for them. Students have a lot going on in their daily lives spending time with friends, sports, religion, and family emergencies. These are some things that constantly impact students lives on a daily basis, and if they are dealing with a lot over the summer they might have difficulties finding time to do the assignments teachers give them. Although most students have a lot going on so it not a valid reason for students to put off their work or not do it. However students know their schedule better than teachers they could design a project that they could fit into their schedules and complete on time.\n \n Students in their teens or lower are often feeling many emotions through the year but teachers probably don't think about that as they assign summer projects. A student getting a projectÂ they don't think they can handle while they are dealing with a lot at home could push them to make a bad decision like doing drugs or getting in a fight. Students could be feeling stressed, angry, or sad and getting an assignment they might not think they can handle could make them act out in unpredictable ways. Some may say that getting a project has no impact on a students emotion health. However the fact is all students have different conditions that they live or grew up in so when teachers assign projects they can't assume that all students are fine. If students could chose their own summer assignments they could chose something that would not feel so overwhelming to them.\n \n The whole point of summer break is so students get a chance to relax and prepare themselves for the next school year. While it is important for students to do a little work so they don't forget what they have learned so far, teachers should not force the work on them and they should not feel like it is too much to handle. In the past teachers designed the summer projects and students just had to deal with it but that system is flawed. Does it really help students review what they have already learned? What's to stop them from copying the assignment from a friend. Going forward students should have the choice to design their own summer project with the help of a teacher. While it is best for them to feel comfortable and want to keep learning over the summer teachers need to make sure that it covers the right material and that it is not too easy.",

      "Throughout the span of a student's 3 month summer break, it is inevitable that their acquired knowledge from the previous school year will gradually decline due to the sudden ceasing of education for this period of time. Many teachers, however, believe that it is crucial for a student to continue their studies throughout the summer break in the form of a project that will allow the student to apply their knowledge through hands-on means. However, in order to ensure that a student gains the most benefit from this summer project experience, it is only reasonable that the student design the entirety of the project because it allows them to be more engaged in it, it builds and improves a student's creativity, and it allows a teacher to understand the mind of a student and his or her preferences after a full year of solely teacher-based tests, assignments, and projects.\n \n The mind of a student is an interesting place, and it seems as if they favor self authority rather than an authoritative figure controlling and molding them to see their own way and not the way of the student. This is also observed throughout infancy and early childhood; people of this age take a liking towards having something done their own way rather than strictly obeying a parent or guardian. Likewise, a student prefers to mold and shape their own experiment or project rather than being coerced to attend to the wants of a teacher. This notion is based on the simple fact that one favors their own choices, as this initiates a sense of freedom in a person. If a summer project assigned to a student is based on the preferences and views of a student, the student has the ability to adjust the assignment in accordance with what they want, and this allows for a higher degree of engagement in a student. For example, if a student has an interest towards environmental science and a strong dislike towards US history, a teacher-given summer project that revolves around US history and is based strictly on the teacher's guidelines is 1 due to the fact that the student would not show a high level of interest for that teacher-based project. As a result, the student wouldn't feel the need to perform his best on the project due to his disinterest. However, if the student were to have a voice in the choosing of a project based on environmental science, the student would transfer his passion of the subject onto the project and perform his best due to his engagement in the topic of the project and the lack of control and authority given to the teacher in this case. Therefore, a student-designed project results in more engagement from the student.\n \n One of the most striking, intriguing characteristics of a person is that of creativity. The human mind is capable of doing wonders that are unfathomable to some; however, this can only be achieved through exhibiting one's creativity. A summer project designed by a student opens many doors and directions to take; from an informative poster to a vivid animation, the possibilities are endless. These array of options force a student to utilize their creative potential. Moreover, a student-based project allows one to 'think outside the box', meaning that they are able to create a project that exceeds the standards and expectations of a teacher. Through these various options at the hands of a student, the high level of creativity has the potential to transfer onto numerous other skills and positively influence them. At an early age, it is vital to utilize creativity to the best of one's ability, as this skill will benefit a student later in their life when an occupation or professor expects that student to exemplify their creativity.\n \n Throughout the entirety of the school year, the manner by which each test, assignment, and project is created is solely in the hands of a teacher. In other words, students do not have the ability to shift or change the perspective of a teacher and what the teacher prefers. However, a student-designed summer project is the one opportunity for a student to exhibit their power and allow a student to influence the manner by which the project is done. After a difficult, enduring school year, it is only reasonable that the student has the power to create their own means of work rather than sticking to the teacher handing out the project with strict guidelines and restrictions.\n \n Furthermore, this opportunity for a student allows the teacher to examine the potential of a student after the school year, including the student's creativity, intelligence, and ability to create a successful project when the outcome of the project relies on the student rather than the teacher. All in all, this one opportunity for a student to play the role of a teacher is beneficial and something that should be taken advantage of.\n \n In today's day and age, school systems around the country have shown interest towards a summer project. However, merely implementing a summer project is not enough; it is important to take into consideration the benefits of a student-designed project and allow the student to have control over an assignment rather than the teacher. This small step of changing a teacher-based project into a student-based project will result in a large step in the future of education and the success of students.",

    essay:
      "Since the birth of the internet and social media, the world has shifted to greatly favor the innovators and the free-thinkers. Society no longer demands students to find one subject they are good at, go to college to study that subject, and then get a middle class job in that field. While performing one skill at a very high level still holds value, the most successful people are those who can think ahead of the curve, those who can think of the next Amazon, the next Netflix, the next Uber, the next big thing. So, how does that relate to whether we have student-designed or teacher-designed summer school projects? Well, letting students design their own projects gives them more freedom, allowing them to think outside the box, which aids the development of valuable skills that are applicable in the real world. Instead of teaching students how to follow directions on a rubric, we should be teaching them to think creatively and how to collaborate with one another.\n \n Allowing students to design their own projects gives them far more freedom than a teacher-designed project ever could. Keeping students on a leash forces them to wear a one size fits all education. Each student is different; they all have different strengths, different weaknesses, different motivations, and different goals. That is why we need to give them tailored education. Giving students this freedom would allow them to create a project that works well for them, and more importantly on a topic they are actually interested in. If we let students do a topic they enjoy, the results will be far better compared to when they are forced to learn about something they have no long termÂ interest in. The freedom students gain from designing their own projects is far more valuable than just following the directions their teachers gave them.\n \n Making students design their own projects encourages them to learn how to think creatively. Arguably, the most valuable skill in today's society is the ability to be able to bring a new unique perspective and thought process to any discussion. That is not a skill that can be obtained by constantly being told what to do and how to do it. Students need to learn for themselves how to go to the drawing board, find out which ideas are bad, which ones are good, and then create a plan to execute the good ones. That is not something that can be spoon fed in the classroom. That's why student designed summer projects are the perfect opportunity for schools to do their part in teaching students how to think creatively.\n \n When forced to come up with their own ideas and think creatively students will develop and enhance skills they would have never had the teacher been the one designing the project. For example, if it is a partner project these two students will have to learn how to collaborate together to design a project, designate jobs to each other, and hold each other accountable for their share of the work. That kind of collaboration never would have occurred had the teacher done all that for them. When students go on to college and into their professional career they will have to learn skills like collaboration, because they won't have someone doing it for them. That is why it is important we take the time to prepare them for than now.\n \n A wise man once said, \"don't follow where the path may lead, but go where there is no path and leave a trail.\" I believe that quote perfectly represents how we want our students to think. The skills developed through out of the box thinking which can be achieved by allowing students the freedom to design their own projects is far more valuable out in the real world then anything the teacher could prepare.Â  Â Â",

      "Summer Projects\n \n Summer projects, as a student i'm not a big fan. But in the case of this argument, I don't have a preferred side. Either way these projects stress you out on a break made for not having stress. I will not say they are a good or a bad thing because there are so many pros and cons it'd be hard to really choose. But I guess I have to in order to pass.\n \n To start, I'm going to list some pros and cons of these projects then i'll pick a side. Lets start with pros. Summer projects, if done correctly provide some sort of education during the off school season. But usually when they are designed by teachers. Cons, there are a lot, and I have a student perspective so it makes sense. When a teacher makes the project, it requires me to actually use my brain. Summer projects takes time and energy from me. They take away time from my job that I could be out making money. So that is a pretty big con.\n \n Since I have to choose, If anyone was going to design the summer project it has to be the teacher. They understand the curriculumÂ and how to apply it to students. Yea, it'd be awesome if students did it. Then there would be a lot less work to it. Personally it's hard to think of a reason to where a student would want to design it other than personal benefit. I'm not saying that all students would do that. But a large majority would. Students wouldnt even know where to start. They would make up some fake assignment that would take like 10 minuets to complete. Which is great and all but there would be no information transmitted over the course of the summer.\n \n Honestly how can students design a project on information that they don't fully understand. That would be chaos. I understand why summer projects are in place. But if i'm going to be completely honest here, I don't want some kid designing what my task to do over the summer is. I see two things happening, that person will be my best friend or I'd hate their guts. There is not much more to be said in this argument. Hands down, with out a doubt teachers should design the summer projects.",

      "A student's life should be lived by a student's choice. While there are a select handful of students who yearn to increase their knowledge day in and day out at school, the majority despise it. Due to the lack of free time students are left with after their school day, weekends and breaks are their knights in shining armor that will save them from the prison they call school. One of the breaks most looked foward to is summer break. This three month halt in tests, note taking and projects is sheer paradise in the eyes of students. However, some deem it neccessary to continue the assigned curriculum into this break to ensure the adherence of crucial knowledge to the students' brain. With that being said, these summer projects should be devised in a manner that will benefit both the teacher and the student to the maximum. And so, to assure their continued learning during their break, summer projects should be student-designed rather than teacher-designed in order to maximize productivity, to enhance their leadership skills and to allow for students to enjoy their project, and hence, giving them a break.\n \n The majority of students innately have a distaste for following directions and taking orders from higher authorities. As a result, when students are constantly ordered to work on numerous projects throughout the year, they will complete it with reluctance. Furthermore, their lack of desire to complete this project will lead to a lack of favorable content, meaning the students will not complete it to the best of their ability. While the teacher may need to put forth guidelines, in order to prevent the students intentionally procrastinating their assignment and turning in mediocre work, the students should be able to partially lead the prompt for the project. When the students are presented with a project they find interesting they will be eager to present their optimal work despite the activities they may be doing during the break.\n \n Taking leadership and making self-guided decisions are skills that students must acquire at an early age in order to succeed later on in life. Although the teacher may portray a leadership role in the classroom, it is quite difficult for the students to replicate the actions they see until they are given the chance. Allowing for students to make the decision on how they will plan their summer project gives them this chance. Simliar to a teacher constructing her lessons, with a student-designed summer project, the students will have to form an agenda based around curriculum and time provided in order to successfully complete it in due time. Ultimately, students will have to make decisions for themselves and organize their daily life giving them an advantage.\n \n Students grow rather lackidasical when dealing with a mundane routine back to back. During the school year, students spend eight to ten months being bombarded by the same tests and the same essay prompts and the same book entries. Summer break, to them, is an escape from all of that pressure. Although it is neccessary to make sure that students retain the information they acquired that year, the students should be able to decide how the reestablishing of ideas and topics they learned. With guidelines and rules given by the teacher, the students can potentially produce work they are proud of and enjoyed working on.\n \n While it may seem rather bizarre to let students decide their own projects, the idea can be fruitful and beneficial for the students and teachers in the end. When the last bell rings for the year released them for summer break, the students bolt out of their school doors and practically forget all that they have learned. In order to prevent that, many teachers have implemented summer projects to assure the continued learning and retainment of their knowledge. However, during the summer when students are on vacation and living in paradise, the last matter they want to worry about is another project assigned by their teacher. Consequently, the students may potentially complete it without care to discard the thought of having work to do. This is ultimately counterintuative to the purpose of said projects. To fix this possible mishap, students should be able to design their projects with guidelines from their teacher so they enjoy the process of completing it while still enjoying their break, ehnace their organization and leadership skills and produce work to the best of their ability, With this method, the students can retain the information deemed neccessary by the teacher and the teacher is able to see this effort and productivity they put into it throughout the school year.",

      "Summer break for most students is a time when they can relax and enjoy a break from school and socialize with friends and family. While it may be in the students best interest to continue learning during the break while not in school, most times students are very reluctant to do their work if there is no in school motivation. If teachers insist on requiring students to complete a project over summer break they may receive better results if the project is student-designed. Having the students pick a teacher-approved topic that they are curious about would make them more interested in learning about their topic, give more effort to the project, and enjoy learning.\n \n When students are interested in what they are learning about they pay more attention, and that is very important in the learning process. Letting the student decide what they get to research would not only motivate them, but keep them interested. For example, over the years I myself have been assigned homework over summer break, usually reading, and my classmates and I were much more inclined to complete the homework when the teachers let us choose what books we wanted to read, rather than forcing us to read something we didnt want to. This translates to almost any age of student, if they are given choices, they feel less forced to spend their summer break completing a project, and are more likely to complete the project.\n \n As most students know, homework is not enjoyable most of the time and we procrastinate until the last possible minute to get our schoolwork done, and most of the time when we do this the product is sub par. This is not because of the lack of intelligence, it is because of the lack if interest and effort. When students do not care about the work they are creating they will put very little effort into what they are doing. While if it is something that they are passionate about they will put much more time and effort into what they are doing. Say there is a student who loves to learn about plants and animals and how they live and survive, giving them a project on the Civil War would not interest them, and therefore they would produce a project created with little effort, bare minimum. If this same student was allowed to research plants and animals over the summer, their project would most likelyÂ be something they are proud of not only because of the effort that was put in, but because they would feel accomplished that they learned something new.\n \n When students enjoy learning it makes them more curious about learning new things. When Students are told what to learn and are kept uninterested, they begin to associateÂ learning with boredom. This can be detrimental for the the growth children, if they no longer want to learn. More times then not, when a student feels defeated, or unintelligent they give up, and that discourages them from learning in the future as well. While it is a teachers job to guide and teach the essential information in the curriculum, it is also their job to foster creativity and instill the love for learning within their students. Teaches giving students freedom of choice would not decrease the teachersÂ authority, it would simply give variety, especially during the summer when students are not particularly wanting to learn. A summer project where the student gets to pick their own topic would be a good opportunity to instill within them that learning can be fun and enjoyable.\n \n A teacher-approved Student-designed project over the summer would be the superior choice over a teacher-designed project. This would not only produce better results but produce better retainingÂ of the information that they learned, to be used in the following school year. Overall giving the students control over what they learn during the summer, would still assure that they are learning over their break while also keeping them interested in learning, allowing them to give more effort to the project, and enjoy learning.Â",

      "In my own opinion, as a high school junior at Generic_School; to further your education during the summer, schools should allow student-lead projects to take place. The pros of allowing students to design their own tailored made educational projects out weigh the cons. When you are able to design your own educational project you put more heart into it, then if it was teacher-designed. That extra passion allows for students: to explore different interests, connect with colleges, explore research foundations, and to participate in community service.\n \n Nudged deep in every student thoughts, especially teenagers,Â is the fact that college is right around the corner. Allowing students to use creativity to there advantage, instead of being left in a box doing a research paper. Gives them a positive opportunity to explore different careers and the majors attached to them. Lets say for a thought exercise, that a high school junior named Generic_Name is going to college, but sadly doesn't know what he's interested in. A student led project, gives him the perfect opportunity to pursue different career fields, to find out what excites him. By the time he graduates from high school, Generic_Name already has a generalized idea of what he wants to major in.\n \n Asking questions is essential in helping to find the right college or university. Creating a student-project for the summer, allows students to connect with both research foundations and professors at different colleges; enabling students to network earlier not later. To better explain my thinking behind this, think for a minute that your Generic_Name, and your doing a project on DNA. By contacting college level professors and other professionals in that field, you not only helped yourself by getting an A on your report, but by networking; when your ready to apply to college and the professors already know you, your chances for getting in just doubled. As a bonus when Generic_Name is looking to get a job or internship; by already knowing professionals in the field, he's more than likely to get his desired position.\n \n With passion comes community service, it's a saying I like to say, time to time. It works like an equation: passion plus creative project, equals community service. The more excitement that you have for a project, especially if you thought of it yourself, puts students in an unique position to voluntary get downed into the trenches of learning. When your learning, you often make the community better than how you left it in the summer. For an example, I recently met a young college grad named Generic_Name; he told me that in high school, his history teacher told him that a team of archaeologists needed volunteers to map an old Civil War battlefield. Sadly though he couldn't, because his English teacher over the summer made him write a mandatory research essay on Jane Austen.\n \n All in all, students should be in charge of there own educational projects during the summer. It's like the old saying, you attract more with honey then with vinegar. Connecting it to a real world application, allowing someone to think rather then to be given; encourages someone to use passion, educate themselves, and put there heart into it, rather then sigh. Plus it's the summer, who wants to read a boring book from the eighteen hundreds! Â Â",

      "What can get the best of the students to complete a school project during the summer. It is between teacher-design or student-design. Student-design would be best for the students. In the summer, the students have the time they need for what the need to do on the project. The students need to know how to find a way to do a project on their own. Students have their own way in learning, which is the reason why student-design is best for students.\n \n The summer is the best time for a project, especially student-design. Students need their own time to figure out what they need to do to for the project. Some students already know what the can do but, other students have hard time finding their own way or doing the project.

    essay:
      "Should summer projects be student-designed or teacher-designed? Since a lot of schools do require a summer project for students so they will have some type of work to do over the summer, it is much better for the teacher to create the summer project. Teachers are trained to give work they know is somewhat suitable for the students. For that reason projects should be teachers designed because they know what type of work to give their students, they usually would not assign something outlandish, they also would not make it as easy as the students will make it be.\n \n Some may argue that students will challenge themselves and not make it easy. People may also say that some teachers assign are a little outlandish and could be very hard for them. some may also say that students have a lot of things to do over the summer like jobs and sports and maybe even both. But not every student has those responsibilities and the others who do should find a little bit of time for their projects. Next, a reason for why teachers should design projects are because teachers know what type of project to design for the students\n \n First reason why summer projects should be teacher-designed is because teachers know what type of project to assign. Reason for that is because teachers most likely having been assigning projects for years know what type of projects may be to hard or maybe to easy for some students. Most teachers by the time it teachers summer will have a good understanding of what some students can do and can not do, and they know if they should make it challenging or make it somewhat easy. Teachers will try their best to not make the projects too hard for the students to complete for example a teacher would not tell their students to read like say ten books and then summarize them, reason being is because they know not every student has the time to complete it if they have other things going on in their lives. Secondly, teachers wold not assign something that seemed very outlandish or bizarre.\n \n Secondly, teachers would not assign a project that was outlandish and bizarre. Like for example a teacher would not tell you to writeÂ 5 full essays in MLA style have it hand written and also typed. Reason for that is because even though summer may seem long it can actually go by very quickly and many students have things to do over that period of time. For example a student may have a sport that has practice everyday or may have a job that requires them to work everyday. With that in mind teachers would make it challenging but will try to not make the projects very outlandish. Another reason for why teachers would not assign a bizarre project could also be that not all teachers want to grade a lot of papers. For example if they were to assign something like a few essays and a reading project all the grading they would have to do is much greater than the work the students had to do, just because their are a lot of students who may have done the work. In addition to teachers making the projects outlandish and bizarre they would also not make the project as easy as the students might make them.\n \n Lastly summer projects should be teacher designed because teachers would not make the projects as easy as the students may make them. Students usually like to not do anything over summer because they think of it as their break from work and projects, so if the school allowed the students to make them the students might make it very easy so they do not have to do much. Students would take advantage of them being able to make their own projects for example, students may make a a easy project like read a comic book or something like that and not do that much. The teacher however will make it somewhat challenging like for example they will assign a project that would not be very easy but will make it somewhat hard. Not all students will make it easy their are some students who will challenge themselves to do good and make a good project. But it would be better and more efficient if the teacher were to design it. Lastly, in all it would be more efficient if the teacher were to design the summer project\n \n In conclusion teachers should design the summer reading project because they know what to assign to their students, they not gonna make it outlandish or bizarre, they are also not gonna make it as easy as the students might make it. Teachers get paid to each students so it would make sense if the teachers would assign the summer projects because they know what type of assignments to give for the students. After all of this is done i want you to,look back and realize why teacher should make the summer projects and why students should not be able to. Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â",

      "As students are furthering their education, teachers are assigning summer assignments in order to prepare them for their upcoming class. Many believe these summer assignments should be student designed due to students' convenience, nevertheless, these summer assignments should be teacher designed because it ensures that students are prepared for the class, exposes them to new material outside of their comfort zone, and keeps students' busy throughout the break.\n \n Before the school year ends, teachers take time out of their work day to produce a summer assignment for their students' next school year. Having teacher designed summer assignments help ensure that students are ready for the content in their upcoming year. Students are unable to know their struggles with next years content until they are actually in that class. Teachers are able to look at their lower scoring topics of the year and put a couple questions of that topic onto the summer assignment. By doing this, it will help the students learn from the past students' struggle topics. Because of the summer assignment, students are able to get a boost and learn quicker when they are being taught in class. An example of this happened during a student's sophomore year while picking their junior year classes. This particular student had to choose between academic biology or honors biology; they were unsure of which class they wanted to take. The student eventually choose honors biology in the end; she found out that about the summer assignment due the first week of classes. She struggled with converting units and was nervous the topic would be a struggle in the class. Her teacher assured her that it was normal to struggle as many other students struggled with that as well. She complained on and on until she came into class that next year and excelled due to the summer assignment she completed. If the student had designed her own summer assignment, she would not have excelled as well as she did because of the teacher designed summer assignment.\n \n As teachers are designing their own summer assignment for their class, they put new material that the students have never been exposed to. While many express how having student designed summer assignments give students more freedom; they don't realize how most students will not go outside of their comfort zone to learn new material. If the students were to design their own summer assignment, all of the material will be information that they already knew or are most comfortable with. Teacher designed summer assignments will give a chance for the student to push themselves out of their comfort zone to learn new information that will ultimately help them with their next school year. For example, the summer before junior year, an AP Language and Composition teacher gave students an assignment that included reading or watching 15 sources. These 15 sources had to be stretched out from 5 different categories: current events, history, politics, entertainment, and documentaries. The students were forced out of their comfort zone by their teacher having their students exposed to all of the different categories. Because of the exposure, the students are aware of information they would not have known if they didn't complete the assignment. When given the chance, students will stay in their own comfort zone; which the teachers can break when there are teacher designed summer assignments.\n \n When the teachers are trying to break students' comfort zones with the summer assignments, it gives the students a chance to think outside of the box and spend more time trying to interpret the new information. For most students, summer break is filled with eating and watching TV on their couch; if the students were given the chance to design their own assignment for the break, they would put easy information for them to complete in order for them to have more time to spend on the couch eating chips. The students would come back with their minds still tangled up with the TV and couch; if teachers were to design the assignment, the teachers would put information that they know would keep the students' minds busy and working throughout the summer. This makes it easier for students to ease back into school; rather than them still being in summer mode 3 months into the school year.\n \n Being eased back into the school year is a thing many students struggle with. It can be fixed by having teacher designed summer assignments. It is time for all teachers to regulate teacher designed summer assignments in order to make the school year easier for all students. While many students will complain about the workload, it will pay off later when they realize the summer assignment helped them with the content of the class. They will also be interested in new topics because of the teachers input in the summer assignment to push them outside of their comfort zone. Overall, summer assignments have been proven to assist students all around when they are teacher designed.Â",

Teachers are able to look at their lower scoring topics of the year and put a couple questions of that topic onto the summer assignment. By doing this, it will help the students learn from the past students' struggle topics. Because of the summer assignment, students are able to get a boost and learn quicker when they are being taught in class. An example of this happened during a student's sophomore year while picking their junior year classes. This particular student had to choose between academic biology or honors biology; they were unsure of which class they wanted to take. The student eventually choose honors biology in the end; she found out that about the summer assignment due the first week of classes. She struggled with converting units and was nervous the topic would be a struggle in the class. Her teacher assured her that it was normal to struggle as many other students struggled with that as well. She complained on and on until she came into class that next year and excelled due to the summer assignment she completed. If the student had designed her own summer assignment, she would not have excelled as well as she did because of the teacher designed summer assignment.\n \n As teachers are designing their own summer assignment for their class, they put new material that the students have never been exposed to. While many express how having student designed summer assignments give students more freedom; they don't realize how most students will not go outside of their comfort zone to learn new material. If the students were to design their own summer assignment, all of the material will be information that they already knew or are most comfortable with. Teacher designed summer assignments will give a chance for the student to push themselves out of their comfort zone to learn new information that will ultimately help them with their next school year. For example, the summer before junior year, an AP Language and Composition teacher gave students an assignment that included reading or watching 15 sources. These 15 sources had to be stretched out from 5 different categories: current events, history, politics, entertainment, and documentaries. The students were forced out of their comfort zone by their teacher having their students exposed to all of the different categories. Because of the exposure, the students are aware of information they would not have known if they didn't complete the assignment. When given the chance, students will stay in their own comfort zone; which the teachers can break when there are teacher designed summer assignments.\n \n When the teachers are trying to break students' comfort zones with the summer assignments, it gives the students a chance to think outside of the box and spend more time trying to interpret the new information. For most students, summer break is filled with eating and watching TV on their couch; if the students were given the chance to design their own assignment for the break, they would put easy information for them to complete in order for them to have more time to spend on the couch eating chips. The students would come back with their minds still tangled up with the TV and couch; if teachers were to design the assignment, the teachers would put information that they know would keep the students' minds busy and working throughout the summer. This makes it easier for students to ease back into school; rather than them still being in summer mode 3 months into the school year.\n \n Being eased back into the school year is a thing many students struggle with. It can be fixed by having teacher designed summer assignments. It is time for all teachers to regulate teacher designed summer assignments in order to make the school year easier for all students. While many students will complain about the workload, it will pay off later when they realize the summer assignment helped them with the content of the class. They will also be interested in new topics because of the teachers input in the summer assignment to push them outside of their comfort zone. Overall, summer assignments have been proven to assist students all around when they are teacher designed.Â",

    essay:
      "A student's freedom from the limitations of the classroom's necessary rules during the summer provides new opportunities for them to learn in dynamic ways. While, in the classroom, a teacher's control of a regulated learning program is unavoidable in order to teach such a broad audience in such a short time, there are no such factors outside the classroom. The variable shape of a student's summer project provides a unique opportunity for the student's specific educational needs to be accounted for - which a teacher-designed project wouldn't be able to take advantage of. Education during the summer should be student-designed, because the student can pander to their learning style and interest, it can reinvigorate the student with a passion for learning, and it instills a certain independence from adult figures that will be necessary later in life.\n \n Students learn in many different ways. Psychological studies have shown that there are different types of learning, from spacial to audio to visual, and students learn better in some ways than others. A rising awareness of mental health has also led to the understanding that brains process information in different ways, so students with autism or ADHD don't get the same results from the conventional classroom practices. Student-designed summer projects would be able to take all these different specifications into account when structuring the project, so visual learners could visit exhibitions while attention deficient kids could apply whatever technique they need to help them study (listening to music for some, a totally still room for others). The dynamicÂ nature of a student-designed project would be an advantage to the kids who need to learn in a different way from the regulated, cookie-cutter methods that teachers use. As well, a student-designed project could angle more in the direction of what the student wants to learn about. Students are forced to spend hours of a day paying attention to subject matters that they don't care for in order to get a generalized education. However, the point of a summer project is education itself, not education towards the goal of a degree. Students would be able to design a project that deepens their interest in a topic, broadens their knowledge in a niche industry. Education would feel more like a hobby than a chore if a student could account for what they learn and how they want to learn it.\n \n A student-designed summer project would be exciting for students, because the agency over their education would allow them to create highly specified and perfect learning courses for themselves. Going through a program that teaches them in a way that they both understand and enjoy would be exciting and possibly life changing. The modern school system is the most monstrous source of stress on the childhood and adolescent mind. Even though learning should be acknowledged as a privilege, wonder, and necessity, it becomes a burden to students. Between the forced socialization of the classroom environment, administrations that care more for policy than the experience of the individual, a constantly building workload, and a set of rules and grades that are constantly judging and disciplining behavior, schooling becomes nightmarish for students. The poor environment weighs so heavily on the minds of children that they often develop mental illnesses or complexes, and, in extreme cases, are driven to suicide over poor grades (which, in the grand scheme of life, should be menial). Student-designed summer projects would be a way to show students that learning can be a growing and nurturing experience, instead of a murderous one. That change in outlook in the mind of a student could make all the difference in that student's optimism, well being, and quality of life for the rest of their schooling career.\n \n One of the main focuses of school is to prepare a student for adulthood. While school accomplishes that in many ways, it fails to teach students how to truly act independently, because their lives are always in some way being influenced by adults that hold real power. A student-designed summer project would fill this void of education, however, because it encourages students to make choices for themselves and then to carry through with those choices in order to make them a reality. Placing the responsibility of their own education on a student would encourage them to think critically and organizationally in order to create and then implement a strategy. The limitless possibilities of the project, because the design is given over to the student, would teach them how to narrow down vague concepts into specific plans. Even arranging for certain resources to be supplied, depending on the project, would show the student how to control moving parts - whether that manifests in asking their mother to buy eggs from the grocery store or in biking to the library to check out the necessary reading materials. Students are rarely prepared for the autonomy of college and the time-managing aspects of adulthood, because they're used to their parents or teachers doing things for them. Forcing a student to design a project that they then have to complete would be an introduction into the decision making of adulthood.\n \n A student-designed summer project would help students grow, because they could change their views on the operations of education in the span of a few months. They would grow to be stronger learners, more persistent observers, and more assertive leaders. Since life is really a process of learning--whether that means learning skills, academics, or something else entirely--an easy relationship with the concept of learning is the most valuable thing for a person to develop. Student-designed projects are an easy opportunity to encourage and teach that kind of relationship, and students would develop an outlook on learning that would improve the way they interact with the world for the rest of their lives.Â",

      "Summer projects are a helpful tool to use to gain insight of a student's capabilities and to prepare them for the upcoming school year. Summer projects can be used for any subject or curriculum to help a student for their next courses, whether they are college level or not. Even though summer projects are designed to help students and can be done in a number of ways, it is beneficial to have it designed based on the teacher's curriculum and needs.\n \n Though there are different varieties of how to formulate a summer assignment, having it expand on student skills and help teach a new subject can be beneficial for the teacher. Summer assignments can be used as a review and to help teach a new subject based on what the course is. Having it designed around the teacher's curriculum and upcoming plans allows for students to get a grasp and to expect what will be taught and the level of difficulty the class will be. For example, summer assignments for math tend to review previous subjects that will be used for a harder math course and will help expand on this knowledge. A summer assignment that I have done is one for Precalculus with Trigonometry that not only reviewed previous math skills but expanded on them which helped to prepare me for the course. Students have voiced that these projects are too hard and can never finish them in time. That is why assignments are given at the beginning of summer to allow exponential time to do them and are made in a way to teach and prepare students for what they will learn in a harder course, making an easier assignment will not be beneficial for these reasons. Summer projects can be made with different variations, having them based on a teacher's plans allows for an preparedness and an expansion of skills.\n \n Summer projects are a beneficial tool for all students and teachers, though it is helpful for a teacher in the new year to teach the subject if students have some knowledge about it. Students tend to struggle when going into a new year, especially with classes that are college leveled and they have no knowledge about it or what they may be getting into. For an AP class, it can be useful for a student to complete an assignment and have some indication of what the teacher's curriculum is and be able to prepare for the class or even drop if they feel like they may fail it. I am in college weighted class now, and if it wasn't for the summer project, I can say I could have possible failed the class if it wasn't based on the teacher's curriculum and I could've been entirely loss in the class. Students may say that a summer assignment should be fun and they should be able to pick what to do, but a student picking the assignment will not be beneficial for the teacher, it can cause a teacher to redo their year plans and may be behind on teaching and preparing a student for an upcoming exam. Though students can pick if what and if they want to do the summer project, the assignments being based on the teacher's future teaching plans will allow the student to know upcoming expectations.\n \n Summer projects are a tool to help a teacher, having them designed around the teacher's plans will allow each teacher to know where each student is and know where to focus most in the curriculum. Every student had different previous teachers who teach in different ways and have different capabilities and extensions of learning which can cause a struggle for teachers. For example, my English summer project was to read and annotate a novel so I could write an argumentative essay on it. After turning it in, it became clear to my AP Language Arts teacher that not every student was on the same skill level for writing and that she would have to reteach the basis of writing for different formats of essays; without the summer project she would not have know this. Summer reading assignments should allow a student to choose the book so they will want to read and get the assignment done. Having this choice, students may pick a book that is not on their skill level and can hurt them when doing assignments in the class. It will ruin teacher plans on what each unit will be and what will beÂ taught in said units. Though students are mature enough to choose their assignments and parts for the projects, teachers design them to know more about each student and will be prepared to reevaluate their lesson plans.\n \n Summer assignments come in a variety of ways, but having them based on the teacher's units and plans for the school year will prepare both student and teacher. Summer projects can be used in any subject to benefit the teacher and allow a smooth year for easier teaching when knowing the students skill set and be prepared to change plans to accommodate these. As a student continues to move up the grades and start taking college leveledÂ classes, it is imperative to have some incoming knowledge of the subject and to expand on previous skills. Summer projects can either be student designed or teacher designed, but in the end a student ill benefit only if the assignment is based on the teacher.",

    essay:
      "Do you really think student's would like to complete summer projects over the summer? Me personally i would hate to even think about having some type of extra work in the summer, why? well here are my three reasons. I know sometimes in the summer, were bored and can't wait to start school. Secondly there's times where we want summer to hurry up and come around, because were drained mentally, physically, and emotionally because of the thought, we have work to finish up, make sure you turn it in on time before the due date and focus on maintaining to keep your grades looking good and not disappointing,. Thirdly, no teacher nor student would like to do a summer project over the summer.\n \n Although, in the summer, were sometimes bored and can't wait to see are friends so were excited for school to start back up and hang out with are fellow peers. Because i know some people can't go out, hang out with friends because their parents are too stricked; or they're furious about letting their kids out at a certain time even though they can have a bed time but some parent's just can't risk anything i'm talking out of experience because my parent's are like that, it's not fun at all. But honestly you'll thank them later on as you get older or when you have kids because, how society now days is set up is crazy! , i tell you.\n \n Then, we started school, for example \"September 4, 2019\" is the first day we enrolled in school then give it a few months into the school year \"January 11, 2020\". let me tell you, the first day of school was memorable, seeing the pleasant faces of missed friends and teachers was probably the best, but as soon you get later into the year it's not so jolly anymore, your're DRAINED the feeling that you just want to drop out, give up, you dress like you don't love yourself because of the amount of stress on school work, the end of year state test's, so you can't help but to say \"I can't wait for summer\" out of your mouth. You feel so relived when the word \"summer\" comes out, you start thinking about all the things you can't wait to do.\n \n After, when you are finished with school, who wants to go home and wants to start on a summer project?? most defiantly not the teachers nor the students, we have been learning for months and i know teachers are sick, tired and cant wait to catch a break, don't get me wrong we need to gain knowledge everyday but after all the months we've been learning and teachers staying after to grade our papers and assign are next assignment when we come in class is a call, a call that we need a break.\n \n To sum it all up. The moral of the story is no, no i don't think teacher's nor student's should be required to complete a summer project over the summer, it's too much for them and i'mÂ pretty sure their brain needs some type of break, you know? vise verse. I hope the schools that require this assignment should think about there decisionÂ a little more. Respectfully. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

      "The Sun is blazing, the sky is blue, and school is out. What more do students want? Once summer starts school books are thrown to the back of the closet, never to be seen until the next year. This worries schools since when students aren't learning during the summer then classes have to be provided for students to relearn everything they forgot. This led schools to develop summer projects so that their students will learn during the summer. However, issues started to arise of how they should be designed. Some say teachers should design it and others say that students should design it. Although teacher-designed summer projects would help set guidelines so that the students can learn as much as they can, student-designed projects will let the students showcases their creativity.\n \n When designing the summer projects, teachers most definitely would set guidelines for students to help them, when they get stuck. However, what teachers don't realize is that by setting guidelines they are really restricting the student's creativity. They are limiting what the students can do and for the students to get a good grade on the projects, they would base their entire project on those guidelines. Which would mean they aren't really learning. These set guidelines would correspond with the topics that the teacher assigns. The assigned topics would focus on the materials the students need the most help in. Which in reality is forcing the students to learn. When someone is forced to do something they aren't interested in doing, they wouldn't usually put their full effort in to completing that task. This is the same for students too. By forcing the students to do these projects and not letting them chose what topic to do, the students wouldn't put all their effort in the project. This represents that the students aren't actually learning. This would be theÂ oppositeÂ effect of what the summer projects were intended to do.\n \n If the students were to, however,Â design the projects instead, then the issue of them not learning would be avoided. By making the students design their own projects, they are able to showcase their own creativity and develop new skills. Most students, during school, have a difficult time demonstrating what creativity they have. However, by giving them this chance to design their own projects the students can really put their full heart into it since they would actually have interest in the topic. By being able to design their own projects students can also develop new skills, like leadership. Leadership is when someone is able to take charge in a difficult situation. The students would be able to represent this when they have to take charge to develop their own project based off the topic they chose. Having the ability to showcase their own creativity and develop new skills, students would be able to fully grasp what their learning. Schools then wouldn't have to worry about assigning classes so the students can relearn everything they forgot, since when school starts in the fall students would be ready to tackle new topics.\n \n When it comes to demonstrating why students should design their own projects, schools should look towards the science fair. The science fair is a student-designed project that every student has to do, at least once, in their high school or middle school life. The science fair makes students pick a topic that their experiment would be based off of. When picking the topic, the student is showcasing their creative side since they aren't restricted on what topic to pick. During the experiment process, students are able to develop research skills for when they have to write their background paper on their hypothesis. Since they would need to find respectedÂ articles that relate to theirÂ hypothesis.Â Students would also be developing their leadership skills since when doing their experiment things can go wrong and they have to take charge and figure out why. At the end of the science fair process, students can then really grasp the understanding of the scientific design process and how to develop a well done experiment. This would all be possible since the science fair is a student designed project. If the teacher were to design the project and pick the topics, students would have never been able to fully understand the scientific design process.\n \n Schools should make the summer projects student-designed since it allows students to showcase their creative side. Even if having them teacher-designed would help set guidelines the students can look back at when stuck. By having teachers design the projects, students are going to be restricted and aren't going to be able to really learn since they won't be putting all their effort into the project. This would all be avoided if students were to design the projects themselves, because they won't be restricted and instead they would put all their effort into the project. At the end, students would be developing new skills and getting to actually learn. A perfect example is the science fair, where students are made to design their own experiments so that they can understand the scientific design process and how to properly make a experiment. Schools should trust their own students for their own learning at certain times.Â",

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. These projects range from all sorts of different styles and designs. Some people argue that these assignments should be teacher-designed so it is more detailed and challenging. Others argue that it should be student-designed so its better for the student. Summer projects should be student-designed because students will learn better from it, students will be more passionate about it, and teacher-designed projects take away freedom.\n \n Summer projects should be student-designed because students will learn better from it. People learn better when they do things themselves. If students have the ability to choose how to do their project, then they can learn from their mistakes. Mistakes are the best way to learn which makes student-designed projects the best way to learn. Furthermore, its helps students overcome obstacles. When students are doing their projects they will run into troubles. If the project is student-designed, they will have to overcome these obstacles themselves and help them grow academically. To sum it up, student-designed projects help students learn from mistakes and help them overcome obstacles.\n \n Summer projects should be student-designed because students will be more passionate about it. Students will do their project if they can choose what its on. If students can choose the subject of the project they will be more likely to do it because they are interested in what it is about. If the project is something they do not care about, they will not complete the assignment. Students will have more fun doing the project. If students can choose the subject of the project they will likely choose something they are interested in. If the subject of the project is something the student enjoys, they will have a great time doing it. To sum it up, student-designed projects will encourage students to complete the assignments and students will have a good time doing it.\n \n Summer projects should be student-designed because teacher-designed projects takes away a student's freedom. Teacher's get to choose everything. Teacher's get to choose what assignments students receive throughout the whole school year. Students should get the chance to be free and choose what they want. Furthermore, Students should get the choice of how the project gets done. Students have to take time out of their vacation to complete their summer project. Since they're using their own time, they should at least get to decide how to do their project. To sum it up, student-designed projects give students the freedom to learn what they want to learn.\n \n Student-designed projects are better than teacher-designed projects because they help students learn better by making them overcome obstacles. Students are also more passionate about it and it gives them the freedom to do what they want. Students don't get the chance to choose many things, but summer projects should be something they get to complete the way they want.",

      "Summer break is the declaration of emancipation that sets students free from the abyss of school. The simple thought of summer elicits euphoria: late night movie marathons, hanging out with friends during weekdays, and sleeping in without having to worry about homework or exams. Nevertheless, there is one thing that keeps students' desks occupied during this relaxing break: summer projects. The disappointment of summer assignments is universal; I experienced this unpleasant disruption of paradise in both Korea and the United States. Having to complete projects during summer is stressful and time consuming--time that could be spent having fun with friends and family. Making summer projects student-designed rather than teacher-designed would therefore enable students to use their imaginations to implement and store their knowledge in a creative way, experiment with interests and passions, and enjoy their break stress-free while promoting their intrinsic motivation at the same time.\n \n The entire school year is based on teacher-designed learning systems. Students complete worksheets and tests created by teachers, and projects itself are also designed by teachers--students are expected to follow a specific rubric with which they are graded based on. This rigid, inflexible system of learning prohibits students from expressing their creativity in fear of getting a bad grade. Thus, summer break should be preserved as a time for students to use their own imagination and creativity to complete a project that would help them maintain what they learned during the school year. For example, a student-designed summer project for a science class would encourage a student's thinking as they would be given the freedom to choose any topic that strike their interest to experiment or research on. On the other hand, a teacher-designed science project would simply be filling out packets of worksheets from academic readings. I have experience with the latter teacher-designed project from my sophomore year of high school. For my AP Biology class, I was given summer homework for which I had to read a biology textbook and complete worksheets. Looking back, I can say that the hours of reading were not helpful to my overall success in the course because I would fill the blanks without really understanding the information, or simply copy off of my friends.\n \n In addition to providing an opportunity for use of creativity, summer is the perfect time to experiment with your interests and learn new skills. During school, students are so focused on studying to get good grades that they do not have the time to take a second and consider what their passion is. The long summer breaks are the once-a-year chance for students to explore and discover interests. To take my experience for example, my 6th grade summer homework in Korea was to complete tasks related to music and science--no specific guidelines or rubrics provided. That summer, I went to a music camp for a month where I practiced orchestral music with fellow musicians. For the science portion, I learned how to fix a leaking toilet, install new lights on the ceiling, and change the filter of a water fountain connected to a bathroom from my dad. Not only did these tasks complete my summer project, it was beneficial to me as I developed a passion for music and also learned valuable life skills.\n \n Above all the benefits of summer break, the number one reason why students look forward to summer is probably because of the relief of stress. Summer is a time of break from school. During summer, students spend time with friends and family to enjoy the long break before entering the stressful school year. However, the amount of summer projects given, exclusively teacher-designed, seems to negatively correlate with the amount of stress relieved during summer from the school year. If students were allowed to create their own projects, they would be less stressed as opposed to when teachers assign them projects with strict requirements no different from the standard school work. For example, rather than English teachers assigning a list of books for students to read and annotate, allowing students to choose their own books would encourage many to actually complete the task. Having the freedom to choose their own book would be appealing as they would not be restricted to the expectations of school courses. This would help to moderate the stress from the project and instead provide intrinsicÂ motivation for the students to continue learning over the summer.\n \n A good solution for students' hatred toward summer assignments is enabling them to create their own project. Not only do student-designed projects promote creativity and high-level thinking, they also allow students to explore their interests and acquire new abilities. Moreover, having the freedom to choose their own projects lessens the stress of having to take the time out of their break to complete an assignment as well as strengthening their intrinsic motivation.",

      "Spring break is lots of fun for students that are in school. Students get one or more weeks of school off to do what they want to do. During spring break there still should be some learning going on in the students spring break. Whether that be essays, projects, or book reading, students should be doing work through break. Some schools require students to complete projects during spring break week. Students should design the project that kid wants to do so they can remember it better and learn from what that student is saying and doing in that specific subject.\n \n First, students would benefit more from making their own projects from scratch. So many kids can not always comprehend what the teacher is teaching them so the kids try an put the knowledge into his or her own words. Teachers should not be responsible for how the students do the projects. Kids and teens that are in school can retain more information when him or her are doing the project based on what they think is right. Also, the students should be able to choose what the project that student is going to do because, the students are more likely to agree, be able to compare with that project, feel more connected with it, and interested.\n \n Second, learning during break is a good thing for students to do for themselves without the teacher present. If the kids put his or her own effort into doing a project without the teachers outlines, the students will be way more successful in learning and retaining the information those students have just done in the project. In some cases, having a student make up his or her own projects is a gigantic help to the grade and to the teachers. Students would benefit more from making the project something that student loves to do or a special hobby that kid has.\n \n Some may say that, a teacher designed project is better for the students. Students would be able to go back and reference what is supposed to be on the project that the teacher has given that person. However, student designed projects are better for the class. The kids will be willing and able to do a project thatÂ him or her want and desire to do.\n \n In conclusion, kids should design the project so that him or her can remember what that student is learning in class. Some students have a hard time grasping what the teacher is teaching them. The kids tend to learn more and pay more attention at home or somewhere other then school. Projects over spring break should be student designed.Â Â  Â Â Â",

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break.\n \n Completing a summer project allows students to refocus more quickly when school starts again and ensures that skills students learned during the previous school year remain sharp.\n \n Additionally, the completion of a summer project provides for a phantasmagoria of success throughout the upcoming school year.\n \n However, most of these summer projects are teacher-designed rather than student-designed.\n \n Summer projects should be student-designed because students learn differently, can explore their passion, and can show off their unique skill set.\n \n Obviously, students have different learning abilities and may learn differently from their peers.\n \n For example, students who are classified as auditory learners would not succeed on a hands-on project to continue their education because they prefer verbal explanations or videos to learn.\n \n Additionally, some students are visual learners; they may require to see another person's work in order to complete their own.\n \n Therefore, assigning these students a hands-on project would not be beneficial to their education.\n \n When different learning styles are taken into consideration, it is evident that each individual student is aware of how they learn; consequently, they should be able to devise a project that fits their unique learning style.\n \n Furthermore, assigning a student a project that does not interest them would make completing the project seemingly unbearable.\n \n Students would choose topics that interest them if given the chance to design their own project.\n \n For example, a student who is particularly interested in automobiles would not wish to complete a project on the effects of cow manure on the pollution of waterways.\n \n They, in turn, would not take this project seriously, which would be detrimental to their grade.\n \n Additionally, giving students the opportunity to design their own project would allow the teacher to see each student's passions.\n \n This would benefit both teacher and student because the teacher would learn about the student's interests on the first day of school rather than through awkward \"getting to know you\" activities.\n \n Giving students the ability to design their own projects would allow each student to be excited to explore their interests and present their passions to the classroom when school starts again.\n \n Some would say that allowing the students to design their own projects would cause an issue for the teacher to grade it because each student's project would be different.\n \n However, allowing students to design their own project would give them the ability to show off their specific set of skills.\n \n For example, students who are gifted in vocal music would not succeed on a project that involves woodworking, and vice versa.\n \n Students should be given the opportunity to share their gifts with the teacher so that future projects could be set to their strengths rather than their weaknesses.\n \n On the issue of grading these projects, teachers could evaluate the amount of time and effort that appears to be put into each project rather than using a cookie-cutter rubric.\n \n Students would be more successful on a project that showcases their skills than if a teacher designed the project for them.\n \n Grading these projects would simply take a more evaluative angle from the teacher.\n \n When one considers that students have individual learning needs, wish to complete projects based on their passions, and are more successful completing projects that emphasize their skill set, then one can see that students should be able to design their own summer project rather than complete one that is teacher-designed.\n \n Allowing students to design their own summer project would, consequently, prepare and excite them for the upcoming school year where they would be able to present findings that are unique.\n \n This would then build momentum for the remainder of the school year.\n \n Although projects would prove to be dampening to the students' summer break, completing a project that explores their interests would be less gruesome than a teacher-designed project.Â",

      "Summer break is for students to have fun and enjoy the long warm days, however, school requires for students to continue learning. The way they want you to continue your learning is by making projects. Schools want to know if they should be teacher-designed or student-designed.\n \n In my opinion if students are going to be required to make these projects they should at least be able to be student-designed. Since it's summer, students are not going to be pleased having to make a project espescially if its teacher-designed. If students were allowed to make the project their own way they would be able to make anything that involves what is going on with their summer break. They would have also more options and ideas than if the projects were to be teacher designed. Student's would have a greater chance doing extremely better if they went based on their own creatation.\n \n Students would maybe struggle a little because then again they are only students, so they wouldn't know if they did it right or if they have enough work done. If it were to be teacher-designed, student would have an idea of how much they would need to include. It would take longer but a student would know what the teacher is looking for and what they would consider a good grade. As a student myself i overthink a lot on the work i do on my own; i ask myself \" does this look right or is it missing something?\". Which leads me to try and making it better.\n \n Overall, i would prefer if the school would allow the projects to be student-designed instead of teacher-designed. It would take less time if students had the choice to have our project made the way they think is best. Students work faster when given something to do on their own because it opens their mind up to more than one thing. Since the project is a requirement i feel as if it should be fun and made however students feel is right, this way they spend more timing doing it and getting the work done.\n \n In conclusion, students should be allowed to have the choice to make their summer project just the way they feel is right. Teacher-designed projects don't let a students be as creative as if they made it with their own ideas.",

      "Having a summer project to do may seem like a bad thing byt what if you got to choose the project you wanted to do or would you let the teacher choose, these summer projects should be givien by teachers.\n \n The teachers would know what projects and what to expects from certain kids. While knowing what kids she has she would not give the kids to mush work or to little work. Then from there on the teacher would give the right amount of work to the kids so they can still be ready for school but also have fun on their vacation. As of this choice is the students decide to do it or not it won't harm the teacher, but for the kids that do it they might have a extra credit put in or maybe even help them pass a class.\n \n More reasons for teachers to assign these projects would be, cause the have more time on their hands.\n \n Students get out before the teachers and teachers still have to work extra few days for planning for stuff. When they do this they can take some extra hours to make this project depening on the subjects they are doing and what they are doing it might take a while, but they can get it over as soon as possible. The teachers that already do summer programs could also help with making, creating, and grading the projects and the teachers would probably get it done in enough time for the student to finish\n \n While on the aother hand;, students may think that if they go tot plan it that it wouldbe alot better. Students wouldt attempt to probably cheat and get veryone the same project ao that they all can do it together.\n \n The kids would not take their own project that serious seeing that most kids barely take school seriously. Student would make short little projects about what they did for summer or something tghey wouldn't really pick something that would keep them educated out of school. They wouldn't really care about something they have a choice for they wouldn't taoke it serious. Teachers will get it done in enough times; on ther other hand the stiudents might not, also some students may have a different influence on other students but some may not so they might not like the projects that they get given to them by certain student. Students will listen to their own teachers but the only problem is will they do it.\n \n In conclusion, teachers should create these sumer projects instead of students cause they are actually going to make them educated and well-shared; while on the other hand students don't have the same influence as teachers.Â  Â Â Â",

      "Summer assignments are known to and disliked by every students that has had to complete these tedious tasks. Schools assign summer projects to assure that their students are still learning during their breaks. However, as you grow up the tasks that are assigned tend to shift from something that is teacher-designed to student-designed. Some people may say that teacher-designed assignments are more beneficial to a students learning, because teachers know the material that should be learned and these project are easier to understand.Â However, they are wrong because student-designed projects have a lot more benefits that are necessary to a students learning and growth. Summer projects should be student-designed because they ensure that the subject of the assignment is relevant and interesting to the student and they teach them important skills.\n \n To begin, student-designed projects let students pick subjects that are most likely to benefit them. Teachers dont know what field every student wants to study in, and so they cant make a project that will be beneficial to everyone. For example, the most common summer assignment is to read a book and then write an essay on what the student has learned, which helps kids in their reading and writing skills. However if a student wanted be a scientist, although this project would be somewhat useful, it wouldnt help them get closer to achieving their goals and dreams. On the other hand if the project would have been student-designed the future scientist could have chosen to conduct experiments or learn more about what interests them. Also, student-designed projects motivate kids to continue learning and so they wont lose interest. When a student picks their own assignment, they will be more likely to finish it and more than that they will actually want to finish the project. An example of this in a different context from my daily life is myself doing some cleaning. If my parents told me to clean, i will most likely put it off or do a sloppy job, because i didn't want to do it in the first place and at that point i am being pressured and forced to do the chore, but if i chose to do it on my own terms everything would get done in an orderly fashion. I feel like students use a similar mindset for completing project. If it was student-designed, they would be motivated to keep working and in the end they would produce better work. Some people may say that teacher-designed projects are better because, they focus on material that students should know for every career option, but they are wrong because what is important to learn in one field might not be as important to learn if they chose to pursue a job in another field.\n \n Secondly, student-designed projects teach students very important life skills. It teaches them to be self-reliant. They have to come up with their own project and set out their own rules and criteria. They cant look back at the instructions and follow what the teacher said, and they cant ask specific question about how to do the project, because everyone has a different project specific to themselves. This type of project makes it necessary to think on their own and not get help or take short cuts from others. Learning how to problem solve and understand things on your own is something that will be crucial as an adult so it best to learn it at a young age. Also, self-projects help you stay organized. When you are doing something completely on your own, with your own ideas you cant lose or forget things because it is detrimental to your project. Unlike something that is assigned where you can just look back on the website or check the paper to find the answers, you have to keep track of everything yourself or else you wont have the answers. Lastly, student-designed projects help with time-management. During my personal project, since i had trips and activities planned during the summer, i had to set out a specific time lineÂ with goals that i wanted to have complete by each week. Before this project, I was very bad at completing tasks because i would always put it off until it was the very last minute. With this project, i was forced to do everything in a process or else i would fall behind. Students would not learn all these skills if everything was laid out by a teacher in a teacher-designed project.\n \n Although teacher-designed projects are easier to understand and the teacher know what material is important, student-designed projects are a lot more beneficial to every individual student. Having a student design their own summer project ensures that what they are choosing to learn is beneficial and interesting to them. It also teaches students life skills that are important for everyone to learn at a young age. The point of summer assignments are to keep the student learning even when they are out of school. I think if the main goal of the school was to have students just learn information during the summer, then a teach-designed project would be acceptable. However, if the schools wanted their students to not only learn but grow and develop as young adults, then havingÂ student-designed projects are the better options to go with.Â",

    essay:
      "In today's world, the competition for higher education is ever increasing, with the requirements for test scores, GPA, and extracurricularsÂ growing exponentially each year. To help keep up with the competition and separate students from the general masses, some schools are beginning to require summer projects to ensure students are continuing to learn, even when out of school. While this practice is becoming more and more common, many schools are struggling to decide whether these projects should be assigned by the teacher or created by the students. Although some say that teachers should assign summer projects because they will be more suited to helping students learn, summer assignments should be student-designed because they will excite students to learn, be better suited for the students' lives, and encourage creativity.\n \n First, student-designed projects are superior because they inspire and excite students. In a learning environment, passion and excitement are paramount to student success. Often times when teachers assign projects and assignments, they have little regard for the interests of the students, causing the class to dread working on the assignment and putting it off until the last moment. Also, when students choose their own project, they can ensure they are relevant for their future plans. For example, if a student wanted to become a banker in the future, they could base their project around the world of economics instead of wasting their time on a project about the Civil War. All in all, student-designed projects would encourage success because students would be more invested in completing the projects and they would help them in their future careers.\n \n Additionally, student-designed projects benefit students because they are better suited for students' lives. In any given high school, there are students who live drastically different lives, from students who have to work two jobs to teens who have nothing but free time after school. Because of this vast diversity, not all students reap the same benefits from a teacher-designed project. If students were able to design their projects, they would create projects that work best with their schedule and do not cause any undue stress. In addition, some projects are not economically feasible for all students. As an example, if there was a teacher-designed project that required all students to build a robot out of costly circuit boards and 3-D printed materials, not all students would be able to afford the materials, causing them to take short cuts and hurt their grade. Student-designed projects would ensure that students can design an assignment that fits their budget and would help to close the disparity in success between wealthy and working class students. To conclude, student-designed projects benefit students because they ensure that the assignments fit in with students' busy schedules and tight budgets.\n \n Finally, student-designed projects help ensure out-of-school learning by helping to spur student creativity. When students are assigned a project by a teacher there is little abstract thought needed to complete the project, all they have to do is follow the teacher's directives and they will get an acceptable grade. When students create their own projects, however, they are forced to think deeply throughout the entire process, from formulating the topic to deciding upon the presentation methods. Also, student-created projects encourage creativity because it opens the door for the study of more abstract topics instead of the mundane, ordinary topics that teachers usually dwell on. For example, music is shown to increase creative thinking, so if a student wanted to learn about the French Revolution, they could create a topic like, \"The French Revolution and its effects on the Romantic music of the day,\" instead of an ordinary topic like, \"The effects of the French Revolution.\" In summary, student-created projects encourage learning by requiring students to use their creativity.\n \n In conclusion, student-designed summer assignments help students learn because they interest students, fit students' lives, and inspire creativity among teens. If schools began to implement student-designed summer projects, they would begin to see an increase in passion and preparedness come August when students go back to school. As a result of the increased drive shown by students, schools will also begin to see more and more students attending accredited, well-respected universities upon graduation. Schools must start allowing students to design their students to design summer projects, for it will create an educated, passionate, and happy school community.",

    essay:
      "Many students and teachers argue over the question of whether or not students should be able to design their own summer break projects. There are mixed answers over the quality of the work, the amount of creativity that should be allowed in the school building, and how well this ensures students learn the material. Teacher led projects, however, take away all of the potential positive effects associated with those concerns. Summer projects should be student designed to increase creativity in students, make sure students know their classroom material well, and increase the quality and student interest of these projects.\n \n Summer projects should be student designed to boost creativity in students. When a teacher designs a project, it takes away the opportunity for the student to design and create their own representation of the assignment. When students get to choose their methodology of presentation, there are often more creative outcomes. For example, in an AP Government class at Generic_School, the students were given the opportunity to create a project on one of the departments of Congress. This led to numerous different types of projects: songs, raps, creative videos, etc. Had the teacher mandated they all do a PowerPoint (or other mode of presentation), the students would not have had nearly as much fun or been as informative in their projects. School should be about learning, but there should also be an element of creativity and expressing oneself in the classroom. Letting students design their own projects leads to much more creativity and student interest in the classroom.\n \n An additional reason that summer projects should be student designed are to ensure student comprehension of the topic. When a student has to generate their own mode of presentation, this ensures that they fully understand the classroom material, because the expectation in student designed projects is that students have to not only understand the material, but know it well enough that they can pick an appropriate way to present it to their peers. In the AP Government class, when the students were able to present their own projects to the class, many students agreed that they learned the material better than they would have if they had just done a generic presentation. It is common knowledge that when someone knows something really well, that they can teach it, and this kind of presentation enables the student to show exactly how much they know. Student designed projects make sure that students know their class information very well, and can teach it to their peers as a result.\n \n Some might argue that having a teacher designed project is better because when students are given the freedom to do their own project, the quality will not be as high. This, however, is not the case; although there are always counterexamples, the vast majority of students put more work into their presentation when given the opportunity to choose what it looks like. Referring back to the AP Government class, classroom presentations where students had the liberty to present how they chose were always of higher quality than projects where the teacher chose the mode of presenting. This is due to lack of interest in students; if a student is not interested in their project, they will not put as much effort while when students are given a creative outlet, they tend to put more of themselves into their work. Teacher designed projects are not the better of the two options due to their lack of freedom and decreased quality of work as a result.\n \n Summer projects should be student designed to boost creativity, ensure student comprehension, and increase the quality of their projects. When students are given the freedom to express themselves, it improves the learning environment and encourages more students to come to school. Teachers should be able to give their students more freedom in assignments such as summer projects.Â",

      "If I was to receive work for the summer break I would rather it be student designed work and not teacher designed work for many reasons. Theres the fact that if my work was designed by a student someone with a similar mindset as my own I would be able to understand it more clearly than if it was designed by a teacher. Plus theres the fact that student designed work has a possibility of being more simplistic, although teacher designed work is good for challenging the mind and stimulating brain cells im sure students would much rather enjoy there break much sooner. For example if your teacher gave you the choice to have the person to your left choose your summer project for you or have a five page essay on a prompt she gave you which one would you rather do not that hard of a choice is it.\n \n One of the main reasons why I prefer work made by students over work made by teachers is because its easier to comprehend for those who have a harder time understanding more than others. With students making the work It would challenging without being to difficult to the point were it would consume a large amount of time to complete and not anytime to do anything during summer break. Unlike if you got an Teacher assigned project which could have the possibility to consume a large amount of time to complete. Like for example: if hypotheticaly speaking if the person to your left only give an assignment to write one to two paragraphs about a entire country and there culture or get an a your teacher gives you to write a four to five page essay about the history of schoool and how it started.\n \n If I were to have a choice between simple work and complex work I would choose simple almost everytime because of one main reason is it takes less time to do. With the student designed work you would finish faster allowing you to have more free time to enjoy your summer break and relax away from school. Theres also the added benefit of getting more simple work done in a short time frame than you would complex work. I conclude this by saying that it would be more logical to have students design there own work for the summer break rather than have a teacher assign them some work for the summer break.",

      "Good morning Educators of Generic_City. Have you ever wanted your student, who seems to be disengaged or just not interested in class, to actually feel like they have a choice to make their learning experience more exciting? Then, maybe, you can consider this solution. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. As a student, I believe that students don't need summer projects ; it causes a high level a stress. However, if I had a choice then I would consider making summer projects student-designed. Teachers, this could quite literally be the answer to your prayers! Giving your student a chance to design their own summer project would give them a sense of independence that they need. Not only that, but I can guarantee that your student will have the desire to learn by the time summer break is over.\n \n It's not a surprise when students go to their teachers ; not knowing how to complete their assignments. Although, there is absolutely nothing wrong with students asking for help, but I know teachers get tired of repeating themselves. That is why giving students a student-designed project would increase their independence. Back in middle school ; when I went to Generic_School. My English teacher assigned a winter break project. The only requirement was to be creative. My English teacher had come to the conclusion that giving out a rubric would stress out the entire class. Since then, I've been more open to design my own projects. No more : \"How do you do this?\" or, \"Could you repeat that please?\" I am fully aware of what is needed to be done on my own. That independence is just the thing students need to succeed. Some may argue and say that giving students independence would only stunt their work performance. They could even say that students need that sense of reform. However, trying to reform your students would only be in vain. How are students going to fully understand if teachers don't give them the space to be independent? In fact, their work performance would gradually increase. Students take extra time to complete their assignments whenever they get up to ask their teacher a question. Now would you rather have your student waste their work time? Or, would you rather have your student independently do their work?\n \n It may be difficult to believe, but most students do enjoy coming to school to learn new material. If teachers want all of their students to be excited to learn something new ; they should consider how student-designed projects couldÂ possibly help. Its been proven, that half of the student population feel more engaged in a lesson when the have the artistic freedom. Students could write a song about Math, or maybe come up with their own screenplay about the evolution of rocks. Giving your students the power to designing their projects would, soon enough, catch their attention. Teachers could argue and say that it would only be a waste of time. It might be a waste of time, however, your students will feel more engaged with the subject. If you don't want your students to be interested in the lesson, then you might just lose everything you want your student to accomplish.\n \n Creativity is key in todayÂ day in age. Change is inevitable ; you can't hide from it. People desire to learn new things, but want to be creative when doing so. Teachers must be willing to change the way they want to teach their students. Students need a chance to prove that they are capable to be independent. Independence is one of the main things we, as people, try to achieve in the future.",

      "Many students would like to be the ones deciding what project they will do over the summer instead of having it assigned by a teacher. However they may not make wise decisions and they are very likely to choose the easy way out. Therefore, Students should not be allowed to design their summer projects because students will choose something that's too easy, students will procrastinate if they know it is their choice, and students will choose something they're already familiar with and will not learn anything new. Teachers need to assign these summer projects to ensure that students are having a positive and helpful learning experience over summer break.\n \n One reason students should not design their own summer projects is because they'll choose something that's far too easy for them. For example, If Generic_Name tells Generic_Name that he gets to decide what his summer project is, Generic_Name will be very happy because Generic_Name is a good teacher and probably would've given an assignment that he would consider \"too hard.\" Instead, Generic_Name will now go home and take 20 minutes to write about Spongebobs marine life and get an easy A. This will not benefit Generic_Name in any way, shape, or form because Generic_Name took 20 minutes out of 9 weeks to write about non-sense he knows will be an easy A. Therefore, teachers should assign projects in order to assure that students are actually putting their brains to work over the summer.\n \n Another reason students should not design their own summer projects is because many of them will go home thinking they have plenty of time to complete a simple project. This will lead to procrastination and many students will end up forgetting they had a project to do. For the students who procrastinate this will teach them bad habits and for the ones who forget and didn't do it, it will not benefit them at all. By letting students design their own projects in a 9 weeks time span, teachers are opening the doors to bad habits their students may learn. Therefore, teachers should assign these summer projects in order to keep students away from learning bad habits.\n \n In addition, students should not design their own summer projects because teachers know exactly what the students need to learn. The teacher should choose something important, that's not too easy, and that will help the students out in the long run. For example, If Generic_Name assigns Generic_Name to 3 essays about Oceanography , Generic_Name may not be happy, but it will help him a lot years down the road. When Generic_Name gets to 11th grade he will be an essay master, he will get an A in English class, he will score a 600 on his writing SOL, and he will even be an excellent Oceanographer! Generic_Name will look back and be so grateful that Generic_Name gave him that assignment that he hated so much. Generic_Name will now realize that importance of having good projects assigned by qualified people. Teachers should assign summer projects to their classes in order to help them learn useful information that will help them throughout their lives.\n \n In conclusion, it is best to let teachers do their jobs and be the ones to decide on the summer projects. It is always interesting to see what different students choose for their projects, but the most beneficial to students would be the teacher-designed projects. For students it may not be fun but it is what's best for them and it will surely help them a lot more than the easy projects that they would have much rather chosen. Teacher-designed projects is the way to go!Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â",

      "Summer Projects\n \n By: Generic_Name\n \n Students are in school for 7 hours a day, 45 hours a week, 180 hours a month, and 180 days a year which is a very long time. Many schools in the United States require students to complete a project/assignment to assure that they keep learning over the summer. Students usually feel overwhelmed and stressed about these summer projects because of having to do assignments during their break. I believe that summer projects should be student designed because it allows students to freely choose a topic and not be stressed or worried throughout the whole summer.\n \n When students get assigned summer projects they usually ignore or not do them because the topic might be too boring, hard to do, takes a long time, etc. That's mainly because our teachers don't let them be student designed projects. Student designed projects are when the student gets to choose their own topic, do the work they want to do, and do everything based on what they want. Students hope that it could be student designed projects so it could take some weight off their shoulders and making it a topic they are comfortable with.\n \n Counter Claim: Summer projects should be teacher designed because not all students have great decision making abillities and don't have the skillset to do a project without the teachers help. If it were student designed then they would most definitly go off topic or show poor work and effort on the project. Teacher designed projects are when the teacher is in control. For example, they choose the topic, they choose what research you need to do, they choose if its an essay or a presentation, etc. Teacher designed projects help students get ready for the upcoming school year and what they are gonna be learning in class.\n \n Student designed projects can help the students by learning how to do things on their own, help them gain amazing decision making skills, and gain experiences to help them later on in life. When the teacher's in control for everything then the student may lack in motivation or the will to even do the project. These projects can't help a student grow and learn if they are restricted to certain things that they can and can't do. Students should have the ability to do summer projects on their own with no stress and/or no restrictions.\n \n In sum, students get assigned projects or assignments to take home over the summer so that they could keep learning even during the break. Schools usually make these projects designed by the teacher(s). I believe that these projects should be student designed because summer is meant to be our break, we shouldn't have to have stress or anxiety because of these projects during our summer. Student designed projects can help us gain experiences as a student that we would never learn if they were teacher designed.

    essay:
      "During summer break, many teachers will assign a project that is designed to give students the freedom to work at their own pace and fully discover and interesting topic. When this project is designed too specifically by the teacher, however, many students become disinterested and only do the bare minimum of work. In order to keep students motivated, and make the project beneficial in their future lives, students should be allowed to design their own project for the summer. Student-designed summer projects motivate pupils to create higher quality products, solve diverse real-world problems, and develop unique skill sets that cannot be learned inside the classroom.\n \n On the other hand, there are many who support the use of teacher-designed summer projects, because they are more related to the subjects taught in school and thus more useful in furthering students' education. Opponents cite several studies that show students forget nearly ten percent of what they learn in school over summer break. With a teacher-led project during the break, students will be encouraged to remember and use what they have learned in school instead of letting months of hard work in school go to waste. While it is true that students will learn more of the curriculum through a teacher-designed project, a better use of the time during summer is to teach subjects not covered in the curriculum. Topics that are specific to certain career fields can only be learned through independent study, and student-led summer projects are the most 3 way to encourage this kind of study.\n \n When students are given the freedom to choose a project that plays to their interests and learning style, instead of being forced to do a certain project by their teachers, the quality of the students' projects improves dramatically. One way that this freedom encourages a higher quality project is by increasing student engagement. Modern psychological studies have shown that students are less driven to succeed at a task if they feel they are being forced to accomplish it. Students allowed to choose their own summer project would not feel forced into a specific course of action, increasing their engagement in the assignment and thus the overall quality of their final project. Designing their own project also creates a higher-quality product by adapting it to their own learning styles. Psychologists working in the field of memory have found that students often learn best in one of four learning styles: Reading/Writing, Auditory, Visual, or Kinesthetic. With the ability to adapt the requirements of the assignment to their learning styles,Â students would create a higher-quality product with much less unnecessary effort. Because of this increase in quality, student-designed projects are also very 3 at solving real-world problems.\n \n Projects that have been chosen and designed by students create solutions to real-world problems in ways that teacher-led ones cannot. By deciding on their own projects, students can pursue interests that lie outside of the usual subjects found in school. Summer projects designed by teachers usually focus on one of the few categories of science, english, or mathematics that schools teach. Students who are provided the opportunity to design a project on their own will be able to pursue fields of study that are not touched on by schools, gaining knowledge in many other diverse areas of study. In addition, the ability to choose their own projects allow students to tackle problems that face our world today with their own unique solutions. As one example of this, a team of students who chose their own project for science class was able to create groundbreaking new technology for removing floating debris from the ocean, which has the potential to improve the lives of billions of people who depend on the health of the ocean to survive. If more students could pursue their interests in the same way that this team did, many new solutions to today's problems would emerge. In addition, students who pursue their own interests in this way are also much more prepared for their chosen careers in the future.\n \n Student-designed projects develop unique skills in students that are not learned through teacher-led study. One skill that independent projects teach is the ability to do creative, independent work. As adults, many find that leadership positions in the workplace require some degree of creativity, and tasks must often be completed with little input from those higher in the chain of authority. By allowing students to produce their own ideas and work on their own schedule, rather than assigning students ideas and schedules, student-led projects encourage the traits that are necessary for any productive member of society. In giving students the independence to try out their own ideas, these projects also allow students to learn skills that are not covered by the main subjects of traditional schooling. For example, a student interested in becoming a veterinarian would not learn very much about his or her desired career through the core classes, but would learn a great deal through a project requiring him or herÂ to study animals. Student-designed projects, therefore, are much more 3 than teacher-designed ones when it comes to preparing students for their future professions, and for their future lives as a whole.\n \n When students are presented the opportunity to design their own summer projects, they become motivated to improve the quality of their work, make a lasting impact on the real world, and develop unique skills that can aid them in future careers. When students are given the freedom to choose who they want to be early on in their lives, they become better equipped in the future to make their dreams a reality. In order to produce students who are skilled, 3, and motivated to succeed, teachers should allow their students to choose what subjects they would like to explore during the summer.",

    essay:
      "When someone says the word summer, people don't generally think about classrooms, or tardy bells, or chalkboards. Rather, about freedom from all of those things. Summer is a much needed break from the stressful conditions of school, however, whenever summer is ending and it's time to start heading back to school, students sometimes find themselves forgetting most of what they learned the year before. Some schools are requiring students to complete projects over the summer to ensure that they keep learning outside of the classroom, and to keep what they have learned the year before, fresh in their minds. These projects should be student-designed because summer should not be a continuation of school, students are more likely to do a project if they get to choose what it is, and it gives students the opportunity to excel and be given more trust.\n \n Summer is the time of year where students generally feel stress-free. There's no due dates, and no pressing homework. If these mandatory projects were teacher-designed, summer would feel more like school, and then students would have a bad connotation with the word summer. Sometimes people brush under the rug how stressful school can actually be to students, and summer is a much needed break. Though students do need to continue learning, it would be hard for a teacher to assign a project that fit everyone's specific needs and was appropriate for all students outside of the classroom. Summer break was installed for a reason, because if students go to school for 12 months, they'll more than likely get burnt out and will lose the motivation to learn. If students are allowed to design their own projects, they won't see it as school, but as fun.\n \n Students-no matter what age; kids, pre-teens, teenagers- haven't fully developed yet. They don't know who they are, or what they want, or what they believe in, because all they've known is their parents and the little bubble they live in for the first 18 years of their life. They try to find themselves everyday, they try to discover what their identity is. If students were able to design their own over the summer projects, they would be more likely to do it. There comes a point during childhood when people start to question authority, and start to become rebellious because they think they know what's best for themselves. At some point, kids have to be given that freedom in order for them to fail, gain humility, and then try again. If teachers were the ones designing the projects, students would be less likely to do it, and their grades would suffer.\n \n Teachers will generally tell you that trust is everything. If you don't have trust then you have nothing. Getting to pick your own project as a student, I would be elated. It shows that your teacher trusts that you will make the right decision and that you will get it done. The projects should differ from child to child because if one child wants to excel, then the limitations on the project to make another student comfortable, should not restrict him. Student-designed projects gives the students opportunity to excel in learning and to gain more trust from their teachers. Students usually have breakthroughs at least once during the years they are in school, when they start to realize that what they're learning is important and they start to care about what it is that they're learning, and learning becomes less like a burden and more like a privilege. Designing their own projects could spurr on this breakthrough and help students to realize that school isn't as bad as once anticipated.\n \n Summer should be a break from all the things that cause stress in the everyday lives of students. It should be a time to unwide and relax. Schools are beginning to issue over-the summer projects to make sure that the students keep learning, and remember what they have previously learned. These projects should be student-designed because summer should not be a continuation of school, students are more likely to do a project if they get to choose what it is, and it gives students the opportunity to excel and be given more trust. This will ensure that students stay happy over the summer, while teachers are equally as happy knowing that all of their hard work to educate the students has not gone to waste.Â  Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â",

      "Should these summer projects that students work on during their break be teacher-designed or student-designed? Students should be able to put their own ideas in this summer project and designed it the way they want it to be. These projects should help them make their brains become more active since they will be doing these projects over break. By doing this they won't have to \"refresh\" their brain on what they learned the past school year and will already know what to do when they come back to school after break because of this project.\n \n All students should put their ideas into their own projects and don't have to worry about what the teacher may give them. This can make the students become more active in the world or even school, and actually let them do something over break. They should let the students decide what type of project they want to work on that is helpful for them to continue to learn during break. If the students decide what they want to work on, then they should decide if it's going to take them the whole break or a couple of weeks to finish it. For example, they could do something they love to do over break instead of a teacher throwing any type of project to give them. Some students may be busy during break so this gives them the opportunity to work at their own pace. Since they know what they are doing for their project it shouldn't be that hard for them to manage.\n \n If the students designed the projects then it would let them be more engage on what they are learning and what's going on during their break. The school will have less students who are confused on what's going on and the teacher wouldn't have to keep explaining themselves more than once. Also, it can actually make the students want to do the project, because they are doing something they like instead of the teacher designing something boring. Sometimes the students forget about the project that the teachers designed to them because they don't want to do it or they just didn't understand the idea the teacher was giving them. Therefore, if the students designed it themselves then the school and teachers won't have to worry about who did or didn't do the project.\n \n Some people may think that teachers should be able to designed these projects. They may even think that the kids are not mature enough to do it and it's a teachers job to design them things. I understand it is a teachers job to teach the students, but it wouldn't be fun if all the teacher do is use his or her's own ideas. Shouldn't the students have a right to do things they like with the teachers helping them on the side. If they work together with the students and be more active with them, then that's when the students behave more mature and actually want to do the work. No students likes a teacher who only just talks and only do things their way without the students input.\n \n Students should be able to pick out what type of project they want to do and work it out step by step to complete it. If students do this on their own, then they could learn how to plan and manage things by themselves. They would be learning how to be more independent. This way it can help them later on in the future if they ever go to college and even for their future jobs. This could help the students be creative and have different types of creativity and ideas all around the school. Then, the school will have an idea on what interests their students and know more about them individually as a person.Â",

      "Some schools require students to do projects during the summer, and whether the projects should be teacher-designed or students-designed. In my opinion,the summer projects should be teacher-designed because it can be helpful for future related times and giving guidelines can make the projects much easier. Summer projects should be teacher-designed due to it be able to benefit them the upcoming school year.\n \n To start with, teachers can give students guidelines for the project. The more instructions the students are able to have then the more understandable the project can be. Getting guidelines can give the students more ideas and can be less frustrating doing the project can be. For example,Generic_Name,a student at Generic_School,is spending time starting her project,she is confused on what to do from the beginning until she opened the guidelines that she was giving, having the guidelines made it much more easier to finish due to having a list on what was needed for the project.\n \n Secondly,having to do projects under teacher circumstances can be beneficial for related times in the future. Many more projects could come and be far more complicated,but using their current knowledge from past experience can make the project less frustrating. For example,Generic_Name has to start an project,now that the students are back in school from break,in the past he would struggle with projects,but by using his past knowledge that he learned,he had finished and reached all the expectations needed. In conclusion,using knowledge that you learned from the same situation in the past on your current ones can very much help in the future.\n \n Some people may disagree due to others seeing it in different ways. Others may see the project as not interesting because the students should be able to do it the way they want to due to them having to do the object during the summer and it not being able to benefit them because the students can not look back on their mistakes. Although, the project not being interesting should not be the case because they are learning not playing around. In addition, the students should know that having ideas on an project can help more so confusing them.\n \n In conclusion,these are my reasons why summer projects should be teacher-designed. The project being teacher-designed,allows more ideas that the students are able to use and makes the project easier. The students should now be able to use the guidelines to be able to benefit them on future projects on their upcoming year.Â Â  Â Â Â",

    essay:
      "Think back to a time during the summer, you finally get a break from school, you can relax and do whatever you usually do in your leisure time, but you remember that you have an uninteresting, unwanted, summer project assigned by your teacher that is due in the new school year. Any student can say that they've had a summer project that they rather just not do, yet they have to face the fact that at some point they will have to get over not wanting to do it and push themselves to get it done anyway. Some people may say that summer projects designed by teachers are more affective on the students due to the teacher displaying their style of lesson plans and how they like to teach their students new material depending on the specific lesson. However, I think they are wrong because ifÂ students are able to design their own summer projects, they will be more engaged with the topic it's centered around, they will be able to compromise on a learning style for the project that suits them the most, and the amount of students who turn their projects in on time, fully completed, will increase drastically.\n \n Student-designed summer projects will ensure that students will be more engaged with the project and what they are learning. It is known that if you allow students to give their input on how they would like a certain, assignment, project, or lesson to be created for them, they will end up being more engaged with whatever the specific form of learning may be. The ideas from the students will circle around and bounce off the walls until the most attractive ideas for the assignment, lesson, or in this case project, have been surfaced. Students also enjoy swapping the roles of teacher and student because it allows the student to ensure they will recieve a good grade, enjoy doing the project, and comprehend what they are learning in the best way. Some people may say that students should be able to adapt to whatever way teacher presents a topic of learning and a project to you. However, they are wrong because the way a teacher designs a project can be challenging and take the student a decent amount of time to comprehend how a teacher specifically wants a project done. In conclusion, allowing a student to design their own summer project will raise the chances of a student being fully engaged with the topic of learning and the project.\n \n Student-designed summer projects also come with the benefit of being able to compromise on a specific learning style for the project that will best suit all of the students that have to do it. An example would be that some students learn best visually, they like to have things taught to them shown through diagrams and pictures, so that they can invisualize the topic at hand. The learning style that fits the student the best will display how well they do on the project because of them being able to comprehend it better. I have experienced seeing students ask teachers to explain the topic that they are learning in a different way from what the teacher explained it to them, so that the information could mentally mesh within their brain. Sometimes it takes a certain approach for a student to understand what they are learning and it takes a learning style that best suits them to do that. Some people may say that students don't always have a choice in the learning style a teacher chooses to teach them in. However, they are wrong because students will express to teachers that the information given to them needs to be in a form that best mimics their personal learning style. In conclusion, a student-designed summer project benefits the student by being able to learn the way that suits them best while being away from school, at home, using their specific learning style.\n \n Student designed summer projects will increase the amount of projects completed and turned in on time drastically. A summer project given to a student that does not interest them will cause a student to procrastinate, miss the deadline and have to turn it in late, or just not turn it in at all due to the fact that it is summer and most students aren't very concerned with school work. The project must sincerely gain the excitement of the students so that the project will get completed and turned in on time. If students are able to design the specifics of the project the completion and turning in of the project would decrease overall. For example, from my experience of having summer projects I myself, and other students that I know, have waited until the last minute to do a summer project because of the way the teacher designed it for us. Students are the best people to design projects for what they may be learning because they know what they like and the best ways to instill what they are learning in their brains. Some people may say that students completing their summer projects and turning them in on time depends on the students' skill of time-management. However, they are wrong because time-management wouldn't play a factor in a student-designed project due to the project being designed by themselves, which would ultimately encourage them to do it. In conclusion a student-designed summer project would increase the amount of comepleted and turned in projects allowing the students to have their input in it.\n \n I believe that if students are able to design their own summer projects the students will be more enganged in the project, compromise on a learning style that suits them the best for the project, and increase the amount of projects completed and turned in on time. Students will have a better understanding of what needs to be done for the project and set a specific criteria. Students will be able to not only get done, but enjoy their project will completing it over the summer. The project will not be catered to one style of learning, to the vast majority of students. Also, students designing their summer projects will motivate them to finish the project on time due their incorporation of ideas.",

      "Summer break is a time period of relaxation for students who have worked hard all year in school. Students tend to go on vacations where they forget everything they learned throughout the year. This is why teachers assign summer projects to make sure that their students are still learning and that they still stay engaged with academics on their breaks. As a high schoolÂ student myself, I dread summer projects for the reason of having to complete school work whilst on vacation. When my teacher assigns a summer project, it is usually something that is boring and not engaging with other students. Student-designed summer projects have a completely different approach to them. When students can design their own summer projects, it encourages creativity and individuality from the student, it will encourage students to engage with other classmates and it creates a wide range of available topics to learn about.\n \n When summer projects are student-designed, it allows students to portray their creativity and individuality. When a teacher assigns a project that forces a student to do a task that is not appealing to them, they do not put in their best effort and they do not learn anything from it. For example, when a teacher asks their students to read a book and write an essay on it, students will not be inclined to complete it and will put it off until the end of summer. If the project was student-designed, the student could read the book of their choice and show their understanding of it in many ways. They could show off their creativity by creating something no other students has created, they can portray their own likingÂ and not dread doing it like many students do with teacher-designed projects. Teachers should encourage individuality from their studentsÂ and theyÂ can do this by creating student-designed summer projects.\n \n Summer can be about engaging with friends and family and student-designed summer projects promote that. Students can engage with others to work on a project of their own liking. Engaging with other classmates helps with communication skills,leadership skills and other character traits that can help a student develop academically outside of school. Working with other students is not a necessity for summer-designed projects, where working individually has its own pros as mentioned before. This shows the 3ness of student-designed projects as both methods of learning are both engaging and academic. Teacher-designed projects can also have students work with each other and promote the engagement with other students, however, they do not allow students to use their own liking and interests as freely when working with others. Student-designed summer projects would allow any person to work with anyone based off their interests which would most 3ly help their learning experience.\n \n Learning is meant to be engaging and interesting and student-designed projects encourages this type of learning. With student-designed summer projects, the topics that can be discussed and learned about are endless. The student has the wide range of topics they can learn about and portray their learning in a creative way so that it is an engaging and interestingÂ experienceÂ for the student. Depending on the subject, the student can use his hobbies to create something that appealsÂ to their interests so that they're using this experienceÂ to actually learn in an academic manner. Teacher-designed summer projects are usually limited to a small range of possibilities in terms of topics where the student is forced to learn about something unappealing which makes the learning expirecne 1 for the students, where as student-designed projects let the students use their own interests to create a topic in which they think will most 3ly complete the project\n \n During summer break, students tend to take their mind off of academics and they forget about most of the things they learned about in the year prior. Summer projects help students engage with academics during the long break so that they are ready to come back to school once the time comes. Summer projects can be tedious for students because of the way that they are designed by teachers. Student-designed projects take away the forced work that teachers put upon their students and create an enjoyable yet 3 learning experience. Student-designed summer projects can help students engage with classmates, encourage creativity and individuality and creates a wide range of discusableÂ topics. Student-designed projects make the summer expirecne a more enjoyable time by letting the students create a project based on their own experiences and liking and not forcing them to complete tedious tasks.

Summer projects should be designed by students because it gives students the opportunity to learn more about something of their choice, it shows that they have a connection with the project, and it makes them more eager to learn about different things.\n \n Students should be given the opportunity to create a project about something of their choice. It gives them independence and the ability to rely on themselves. It is good to give students independence starting at a young age because it allows them to be self reliant. Giving students the opportunity to create a project based on their own ideas and their own planning, will allow for success later in life.\n \n Another reason why students should be able to design their own summer projects is because it will show the teacher how much of a connection they have to the topic. Teachers love when a student creates a well designed and well thought out project. If a student were to be given a project designed by the teacher, the student would feel like they couldn't do much with it because they have no connection with it. When students have a connection with something it makes them feel more enthusiastic about the project or assignment given to them.\n \n Students are more eager to learn about new things after they researched something of their choice. When students have a choice, they would rather research something that they don't know too much about. After that topic is researched they feel enlightened. Students also tend to branch off of the topic that they first researched as well. This technique is often used by students because it makes research easier for them and they like to make things easier for them rather than harder.\n \n In conclusion, Students should be able to design their own summer projects because it gives them new opportunities, it shows that they can connect to something, and it makes them more eager to learn about different things. Although teachers can provide students with a base and a template for their project, it would be best and beneficial for students to be able to create and think of something on their own. Students are more prepared for college and high up positions in life when they are given the opportunity to create something of their own. It allows students to have independence and other useful tools for their future.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

      "Hello, reader! My name is Generic_Name. Some schools require student to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. many question if they should be teacher-designed or student-designed? I believe that students should be the ones planning their own summer projects because it will be their summer vacation that they'll have in order to work on it. If the teachers are the ones designing the projects for their students, then teachers will most likely get the same thing from every student. Not only that, we as students may not enjoy doing it as much, because when it comes to doing big projects like these, we desire to put in our own creativity. For these next two paragraphs, I will be talking about these two reasons in greater detail before ending this prompt with my conclusion. They will be backed up mostly by my personal experience, but I will put in my own opinions and reasons. I will also be putting in lots of unique words that will this prompt more interesting. Now, let's begin.\n \n I don't believe teachers should be the ones planning out the project not for the fact that what they would assign will be boring or bad, but because each student might end up doing the same thing for each individual prompt, even if each student does put theyre own unique sense of creativity into them. For example, last year when I was doing Driver's Ed, we entered the part of Health & First Aid. And when all was said and done, we were given a project to do. It had to be be done on a tri-fold and the information had to be a printed out PowerPoint. I'll be honest, I really wasn't a happy chum doing the project at first, although I did enjoy doing the PowerPoint part of the project mostly because I have a love for PowerPoints. When the day came for the projects to turned in and graded, we all showed our own tri-folds to the class. Here, I noticed that we all did similar things in each of our tri-folds. True, we were each given a different topic to work on and many us got a little creative, but in the end we were pretty much the same.\n \n I understand that they do that to make certain we don't procrastinate or do minimum, but in order the project to have some form of uniqueness & full creativity, the student should have complete charge over the what & how of the project. an example of this happened last year in my Spanish II class, where we did a project that was about choosing three Latino recipes and write them out in Spanish. Our teacher, Sr. Generic_Name allowed us to make our project however we wanted, from being a cookbook, miniature tri-fold, PowerPoint, etc. But he also wanted to see our full potential, not just in art but in language as well, so using an online translator was generally unacceptable. And although he was fine with three simple but complete sheets of paper, there wouldn't be any bonus points for that. Fortunately, I paid attention in his class and my mother a Puerto Rican cookbook which she lend to me to use. Also, I don't mean to brag but I'm a great artist who it self-taught.\n \n Overall, I believe that students should their own thing in the project while at the same time, the teachers should receive something of great quality. The two examples I just talked about are my personal experiences & reasons why I believe in the power of the student, although I greatly understand the teacher's viewpoint giving us the basic backbone. So, in a way, neither side is perfect or wrong. But of course, thats just my opinion.",

    essay:
      "The thought of summer brings out joyous feelings; people usually think of summer as vacations, time to hang out with friends, explore new hobbies, relax, etc. When students are asked to describe summer, one of the last things they would describe it as is a time to do school projects since most students actually picture it as a break from stressful schoolwork. School is the last thing on their mind throughout summer, which could cause students to put off their projects to the side to do last minute and think of it as a chore, rather than something that is enjoyable or fun to complete. However, this image can be changed and summer projects can be turned into something that students are motivated to do. If summer projects were student-designed rather than teacher-designed, it could be more catered to what students' interests and likes, students could be more motivated to complete them, and they would be less likely to procrastinate on them.\n \n Student-designed summer projects would have more of what students want since it would be more catered to what they like. Students know each others' needs and what they enjoy--they can agree on what could be considered a fun project and what they consider to be stress-inducing project. With student-designed summer projects, more of a students' likes would be covered, which means it would be more enjoyable for them to work on it over the summer. With more of their interests in a project and with a project they deem as fun--or any type of work at all--students would be more likely to spend more time and energy on it. With teacher-designed summer projects, less interests could be covered, leading to students not putting as much into it as they would if it was student-designed. With student-designed summer projects, these would appeal more to them than a teacher-designed project would, because, as aforementioned, students know what students want to see in projects. When summer projects are student-designed instead of teacher-designed, it would be more catered to what they want and with their interests--which can bring many great benefits to students while working on them.\n \n With more summer projects catered to students, students would be more motivated to complete these projects. They would be eager to work on these projects. Teachers do not understand what students want since they are from different generations, they do not know the current trends or hobbies that they enjoy as much as a student would know. When these projects are designed from people their own age, they know what each other usually like or enjoy. Their interests being addressed would give them a motivation to complete these summer projects, and not only that, but they would genuinely enjoy doing them and most likely want to do them. With motivation, students are able to produce better work. When people are less motivated to complete assignments, they usually put it off to the side or are not able to work as efficiently on it. When students are given projects that they genuinely like, they would stay on track and possibly even go out of their way to go above and beyond from what is asked of them and try and learn more about it on their own. Motivation can boost students to do better, so when summer projects appeal to them more, they would be more motivated to learn more and improve.\n \n Procrastination is a common theme throughout students, but can be helped if they are assigned something they like to do. With student-designed projects, since students would be more motivated and have more of their interests in them, which would lead them to be less likely to procrastinate. With teacher-designed projects, they would be more likely to procrastinate since it might not cover things that a student wants to see as much as a student-designed project. That could lead to the student retaining less knowledge and learning less from the project, which is the opposite of what it is intended to do. When students do not procrastinate and leave it last minute, they are able to spend more time on a project and learn more from it. They would not view these projects as a chore or as something that they have to get done before summer ends.Â Not only that, but they would be able to work more efficiently on it with more time spent. Others might also claim that a teacher-designed project would be more 3 than a student-designed one since a teacher could have more experiences than a student and a teacher knows the materials more; however, a student-designed summer project would be formated more familiarly for students. Students know how each other work, and each generation differs from one another. Their projects would cater to their generation more and include things that they like to work on. Also, others could argue that some would still procrastinate and push it off to the side anyways, regardless of it being teacher-designed or student-designed. However, not all solutions can solve a hundred percent of the issue at hand but having student-designed projects could still solve the majority of the problems a teacher-designed project produces. So student-designed projects better address the large issue of procrastination among the youth--more than a teacher-designed project--and help students be able to grasp more of the concepts being taught and learn and retain more from these projects.\n \n In conclusion, a student designed summer project would be the most efficient way for students to be able to continue learning throughout their summer break, and not only that, but have a project that contains their interests which can lead to having motivation to complete them and not procrastinate on. This would be the most efficient way since it is catered to what they want since students know what each other want best. The image of summer being fun would continue to exist and these summer projects would be enjoyable to complete and look forward to.Â",

      "Have you ever had to do summer projects during summer break? Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Summer projects should be students-designed because students could be more creative, students can go at their own pace, and students would be more inclined to complete their projects.\n \n Some people say summer projects should be teacher-designed because it would help them practice for topics that would be discussed the next school year. However, summer projects should be student-designedÂ because students could be more creative with what they do. For example, when a teacher assigns you a project the set their projects to be something specificÂ like: show a graph, create a drawing of this, and/or write a essay about this. When there are limited options like this, students that struggle at something like drawing could be put at a disadvantage and not grade as high as other students. Thats why if summer projects are student-designed students would be able to show off the talents they have and be more creative with what they present as their summer project.\n \n Secondly, summer projects should be student-designed because student can go at their own pace. For example, some projects could require students to do something that they dont understand and therefore they wouldn't be able to complete their project. However, if summer projects would be student-designed the students would be able to complete the project because they could do something that they know how to do and its at their own learning pace and they could also help teacher know what a student struggles at and what they know really well.\n \n Finally, summer projects should be student-designed because students would be more inclined to do complete their project. For example, one of the reasons many student don't complete their projects is because they think that the projects are too boring or are too hard. However, if the students get to choose what they are going to turn in as their summer project then they would do projects that they think are fun or aren't too hard and many more students would turn in their projects.\n \n In conclusion, summer projects should be students-designed because students could be more creative, students can go at their own pace, and students would be more inclined to complete their projects. For these reasons, I implore teachers to allow summer projects to be student-designed.",

      "On that faithful June afternoon, the school bell rings for its last time in three months. Students rush out of their classes and greet the summer with open arms. Of course, once school opens up again in August, many of these students have forgotten what they learned the previous year. Many schools assign projects to complete over the summer in order to keep their students' minds sharp; however, there are debates as to whether the teachers or the students should design the projects. Summer projects should be teacher-designed so students can properly develop the tools that will help them succeed the following year.\n \n Teacher-designed projects will set the rigor of the class so students know what to expect. It is most likely that the teacher that assigns the project will be the one instructing the class. If teachers design the project, they can set the guidelines for the year in their summer assignment so students are not caught off guard. This is especially important for higher level classes such as honors or AP; it is best that all students are aware of the class' expectations so they can develop their skills as necessary for the course. Students can also decide whether or not the class is right for them, whether it be because it is too rigorous, not rigorous enough, or simply because the subject matter does not interest them. This way there is less fuss during the school year as students try to switch their classes.\n \n Teacher-designed projects can allow the students to grow their academic independence. During the school year, teachers are readily available in case students need to answer questions. However, during the summer it is not as easy as raising one's hand in class; students are almost entirely on their own. They will have to develop the skills needed to solve a novel problem independently. This ability is referred to by psychologists as fluid intelligence. One's fluid intelligence decreases with age, so it is important for students to strengthen it while they are young. Students may also find useful academic tools that help them to understand the material of the class. One of the more well known of these tools is Khan Academy. Students often go to these websites to understand what they could not in class. Finding these tools during the summer will prove useful, as they can still be used during the school year.\n \n While student input is important, the teachers are more likely to give projects that are closer in rigor and content to the actual class. Teachers have been trained both in teaching that the subject that they teach, so they likely know the best way to prepare students for what lies ahead. This is why summer projects should be designed by teachers rather than students.",

      'Having to do school work over the summer? Summer assignments is a great way for students to not forget everything they learned over the school year. If a student goes from June to September without reviewing their course material from the previous years, they are bound to forgetting lots of important information. Students have very creative minds and should be able to come up with their own way of studying or going over past information. Teacher designed assignments can force students to do unnecessary research which can waste a lotÂ of time. Summer projects should be student designed because it allows each student to put their time in to something that interests them, teachers can learn more about their future students, and teacher designed projects sometimesÂ dis encourageÂ students to complete them.\n \n There is nothing better in school or in life when you are interested in a subject. It is much easier to pay attention and a lot more information that sticks with you. Doing a lot of research into a topic your not interested in is more or less a waste of time. A project led by a student could influence others to a career choice. Having to do work is never fun especially in summer but if students get to be creative they can find a topic which makes it more enjoyable. Teacher designed projects limits students into following certain formats and structures which limits the thought process being taken into place thinking about the project. Once again interesting topics lead to better productivity and work which is why students need to design their own projects.\n \n Forming relationships as a teacher is something that can change a students life forever. There are many kids in today society who feel like they don\'t belong or fit in. Knowing and appreciating someone the smallest can impact them more than someone can imagine. A student who creates their own project or structure will definitely tell you something about them. Engaging students with each others work is important to show the passion one may have for what they made. Student designed projects open up the opportunity to really show how much a subject matters and what can be done to change a way in society that is failing. Teachers knowing more about their students is important for students to want to come to class and for teachers to know when someone is not appearing to be feeling their normal selves.\n \n Teacher designed projects are usually straightÂ forward. When a student designs a project they complete much more work. Now I would say that if the students are below 5th grade having teacher designed projects is the better option due to most students at that level not being educated enough to think outside of the box. Regardless learning will take place on both sides and that students will dive deep enough into a subject to break the ice. Relationships will form from students bonding over ideas and sharing them with each other.\n \n When the question "should a teacher or student design a summer project?" comes up, I am aware that both sides has an argument but that students designing it is way more impactful to themselves and others. Career choices can easily be introduced while just selecting a topic. Forcing students to be oppurtunitive and aware student designed projects open it all up and enable them to select something that is interesting and important. Teacher designed projects are good when there is not a lot of time but having the whole summer gives each student many hours to work on an design their own masterpiece.',

      "Have you ever got a summer project?Â Summer projects are boring to do when all you want to do is have fun. Although, teachers can make the projects subject based and more specific.Â Students should design the summer projects because some students don't have access to internet, the projects will be unique, and the projects will have more effort and participation.\n \n Firstly, some students don't have access to the internet. Most projects involve research. If the students can't do the research how are they going to do the project? Some teachers expect the project to be done but what if it can't be. Teachers need to realize not everyone has internet at home. For example, a student was given a project on King Henry's life. He doesn't have internet at home and the library is too far to walk. The student never did his project and got a really bad grade.\n \n Secondly, the projects will be unique. The ideas that students can come up with are amazing. Kids have an unlimited amount of imagination and creativity, so letting them express that through a graded project can be really fun. For example, if the students were doing a science project. They have so many possibilities on what they can do. They could put Mentos in a diet Coke and write down what happens. If it was a photography project, the students can express themselves through the pictures and edit them however you want. There's so many more ideas tat students can come up with if you let them.\n \n Thirdly, The projects will have more effort and participation. If the students have their own say, or choice, in what they get to do the project on, there would be more projects turned in. Plus, the effort put into the projects would be greater. For example, one class gets to choose their project and another class do not get to choose. The class that got to pick their project has more projects, and more effort put into the projects, then the class that didn't get to choose. Another example is the teachers choose what students do one year for summer projects. Many students do not put in a lot of effort, just enough to get a good grade, and some don'tÂ even bother turning it in. The next year, the teachers let the students pick what to do for their projects. Most of the students turn in the projects and a lot of effort was put into them.\n \n In conclusion, students should design the projects instead of the teachers. Some students do not have internet. The projects will be unique. Also, the effort put it and the participation of the projects will be greater. If you have a summer project, convince your teacher to let the class design it. You'll see so many cool projects you might have not thought of.",

This would be better because the students have a topic, its easy, and is fast to do.\n \n First, the students has topic. When a student has a one topic, they cant go talk about another topic. The student doesn't have to struggle between three or more subjects because they have one given to them. The teacher gives a specific topic because it's supposed to challenging. They want the students to use their brains.\n \n Second, the topic is easy. Some school teachers give their students easy topics because they wants students to enjoy their summer break.

      "In a 2019 survey about homework during the summer, it was found that the majority of students said that they were extremely stressed aboutÂ summer assignments that teacher's had required them to do. Many of the students expressed that they had busy schedules and could not find the time to complete the assignments. Other's said that the projects were too difficult and confusing because they were designed poorly.Â While some will say that these summer assignments should continue to be designed by teachers because they are more educational, to be beneficial, the assignments should be student-designed to prevent boredom, frustration, and time consumption.\n \n Firstly, summer assignments should be student-designed to prevent boredom. For instance, the majority of the assignments are question or essay based. This means that instead of enjoying a learning activity that applies to them, students will have to answer dull repetitive questions and write uninteresting essays about topics that they have no passion for. In result, students will put minimum effort into the assignments and finish them without learning anything. Also, if the summer assignments were designed by the students, they would pick a topic that they have interest in or believe would be enjoyable to complete. For example, if a project was assigned that allowed students to present an issue that they found interesting, the student would more than likely be excited and motivated to write about their topic. Overall, projects assigned during the summer should be designed by the students in order to prevent boredom.\n \n Secondly, students should design their summer assignments to prevent frustration. This is because during the summer, teachers will assign packets or papers that are confusing and difficult to complete, thinking that it will be beneficial or educational. However, this is not the case. Many students will find themselves stuck or frustrated trying to complete something that they have no idea how to do. This results in uncompleted or incorrect work that then starts the student's school year off poorly. Furthermore, if the assignments were designed by the students, they would have the ability to preview and understand what the project is asking. In other words, they would have the correct knowledge going into the assignment and will ultimatelyÂ learn more about the material for the following school year. In the end, a project designed by a student will prevent frustration.\n \n Lastly, summer projects designed by the students will take up less time. This is because many students are extremely busy during the summer. Between sports, vacations, and possible online classes, students find it difficult to manage summer homework. Teachers are not aware of every student's schedule and can assign projects that are almost impossible to complete. However, if the projects were designed by the students, this would not occur. Instead, students would design a project that they could easily time manage and complete in their own time. Also, because teacher-designed projects are long and complicated, this can cause a student to miss out on fun activities. This is becauseÂ of the created stress and limited time that the students often experience from the projects assigned. For example, during the summer, many students are traveling and are rarely in town at the same time. However, when they are, a student with an unfinishedÂ project, could miss out on an opportunity to see their friend because they are too busy with homework. All in all, summer projects should be student-designed because this would prevent time consumption.\n \n Overall, students should design the summer projects. This is because it will prevent boredom, frustration, and time consumption. If students experience these effects, the projects assigned will not only ultimately be 1 but it will cause unnecessary stress. The purpose of summer is to enjoy a break from school anxiety. If projects do not reflect this, then a student's summer could possibly be ruined. In the end, in order prevent this, talk to your teacher and see if your summer could be saved with an enjoyable, simple, and quick project instead.Â",

      "Throughout a students educational experience, they have the 3 month break at the end of each year that allows them to have time off and have a break from the intense rigor of school. Although, the break can better be purposed by having assignments to further their knowledge during this time period. These projects can best be designed as student led so that students can have more creativity and imagination towards the project, specialize one topic based on future educational interest, and ensures that students have the resources they need to complete the assignment.\n \n From Kindergarten through grade 12, each student is given a curriculum to follow and learn for a standardized test at the end of the year; student led summer projects would allow for a broader outlook on their schooling education and explore topics that would not be looked at otherwise. A student who only learns about their immediate community and ecosystem can gain a broader perspective on society after completing a summer project about an ecosystem in another region of the world. The additional thought and imagination put into a project like this would be hard to complete in an organized project created by a teacher. Furthermore, students commonly bored duringÂ one project that a large group of students have to complete. The rules and rubric which have to be followed deprive the students of exploration and investigation which is crucial for a successful education. Allowing for students to find their choice of exploration and then present it in a unique way brings a complex ideology about interesting topics. Not only is the content of student led projects productive, but so is the way of deriving that information. Commonly, classrooms follow a strict set of rules to ensure each students safety, but those rules come with a cost. The rules cause students to think in one way, act in one way, and test in one specific way. A summer project which gives students space to compete based on their creativity allows them to break out of those boundaries and complete what they want to complete.\n \n A students future college path can also be benefited by student based summer projects due to the option of focusing on their desired topic. As students age into their final years of high school, many already know the path they want to take in college and ultimately their occupations. Giving students an option to focus and research on these topics will not only allow them to understand more about the topic but also build their application to give them a better chance at getting into respected schools. A student who wants to explore the medical pathway might use the summer project as a chance to see what the field is about. That student might shadow surgeons or pediatricians and then analyze and report their findings. The alternate option of teacher led student projects would not allow for this type of unique opportunity. Using the report of their findings, a student can better apply for prestigious college opportunities, scholarships and programs through their past experience that gives them a step up from their competing applicants.\n \n Lastly, the guidelines given to the entirety of the public schooling system leaves students in lower socioeconomic situations to not be able to complete certain projects. The student led project system allows students to find a topic that is accessible for them rather than one that has a large demand for expensive purchases. Certain projects specifically in the science department, require an excessive amount of resources making them hard to obtain out of the school setting. If the teacher led projects would require students to purchase these goods, difficulties would arise in regards to the ability for all students to have access and an abundance of these items. Although supplies may be given through the schooling system, a work spaceÂ might be difficult to obtain as well. Choosing a project that not only gains the students interest but also allows them to complete it with ease displays the benefits of student led projects.\n \n Projects that can be completed during the summer should be led by the students desires and aspirations as it will gain allow for the most success of the student. Student led projects show most 3 through the ability for students to use their imagination, research a topic they might study in college, and complete the work productively and efficiently.",

      "Every year students look forward to going on summer break and getting away from school. This three month break often involves forgetting important skills and not learning new information. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to solve these problems. These projects should be teacher-designed to ensure that the project is relevant, has a difficulty on grade level with that of the student, and allows for easy collaboration and communication.\n \n While being able to pick their own topic for a summer project may be more fun for students, a teacher-designed project would insure that the information being learned connects to what they need to know for school. A random project in the middle of break is a waste of time if the teacher cannot connect it to what the students will be learning in class. For example, a physics teacher may want to assign a project to introduce momentum or energy, this will allow students to come into class with a general understanding of the subject. Having a project with a specific learning goal will make students feel as if they are making the most of their time and are learning something that will be useful in the future.\n \n When given the task of creating their own projects, students will often design the easiest project they can get away with. Teachers can ensure appropriate difficulty in the projects by designing them themselves. Projects can be adjusted so they are suitable for different grades and class types; the more difficult the class is, the more difficult the project will be. Students wouldn't be able to complete the easiest project they can or overestimate themselves and design a project too hard.\n \n During the summer it is important for students to be able to contact their teachers and ask for help. If a project is student-designed, a teacher may have difficulty assisting a student if they become confused and need help. A teacher-designed project would make asking for and receiving help a lot easier. If the teacher-designed project were to be uniformly distributed to all students taking similar class, the students would be able to collaborate and ask each other for help as well. Completing the assignment in groups would be more fun for the students and easier to grade for the teachers.\n \n Summer projects need to be teacher-designed so they are on topic, have a reasonable difficulty, and allow for optimal communicate and collaboration.

      "After school ends, most children spend their summers relaxing with their friends and family. Not many of us do anything educational on the rare occasion that we may read a book. Because of this, some schools require students to complete summer projects to continue learning during their break. Students should be able to design their own projects because the project itself will be more enjoyable, easier to complete, and more beneficial to students in terms of knowledge.\n \n Many of the projects that teachers assign during the school year are pretty boring. By designing their own summer project, students can have a fun experience with it. Not only that, but students will also be much more inclined to actually do the project. As an AP student, I have been assigned summer assignments for classes, which I ended up doing last minute. These assignments weren't hard, but they ended up being pretty long since we were given two months to complete them. Since I pushed them to the last minute, I was sitting in my house for hours for the last couple of days trying to get these projects done. Now, if I had found a project to do for the class, I would have completed it throughout the course of the break and would have had had a much better time completing it.\n \n Something that we all know is that if you are actually interested in completing the task at hand, you will be much more efficient in completing it rather than a task you are not interested in. Because of this exact reason, students should be able to design their own project because it would be way easier to complete. Not only that, but students will actually feel like its their own task to complete, rather than some random assignment that is assigned by the teacher. Most students, including myself, complete homework for a class the night before its due. Many people think the ideal way of completing homework is to complete it the day it is assigned, but since, most of the time, students aren't really interested in the work, they end up cramming it to a later day. Although, if the student has a task from something that they are interseted in, such as the sport they play, then they will do that as soon as they can.\n \n Another beneficial factor from being able to design your own summer project is that it is much more knowledgeable then a tradtional assignment. What I mean by more knowledgeable is how much knowledge the student actually gains from completing a specific assignment. A particular assignment may require research that allows students to gain a lot of knowldedge, but if the student is bored by the topic, then they will just try to finish the assignment by whatever means possible. They will not try to learn the topic, and will probably end up getting the answers online or from a friend. If we compare this to another scenerio where the assignment pertains less information, but actually interests the student, then the student will definetely walk away with much more knowledge than they did before. Because of this, students should be able to design their own summer projects.\n \n Many people think that if students design their own summer projects, then they will just goof around and try to pick a very easy topic. This is arguable, as teachers can easily set boundaries for their students and have certain requirements such as having a minimum word count, page count, etc. All in all, students can have a good time and gain plently of knowledge if they are able to design their own summer project.Â",

      "Summer projects must be designed by teachers or the whole thing will be pointless. It is said there are many contraversial points that would lead folks to not taking a side on whether students should design summer projects, or if teachers should. However, projects need to be designed and assigned by teachers because it will set the standard of validation, express uniqueness and diversity, and reduce chances of cheating.\n \n First, having summer projects designed by teachers sets the tone on what the outcome should look like and how well a student must do. This prevents student's from simply waiting until the last week of summer and sloppily making a project that is eventually accepted by a teacher. Also, this action will assure the continued process of students learning while on summer break. The whole point of summer projects is so the students keep their minds fresh and ready for the next year, and If the students design the projects, that may not happen.\n \n Next up, teachers will find expressions of uniqueness and diversity in the results they recieve from the students. Every kid is different, and a teacher should be able to recognize that kids best interests and strongest characteristics. With that being known, teachers can design and assign summer projects accordingly. With every kid either working on a project that includes something they are comfortable with, or something they might need to work on more to be successful. This also reveals the different mindsets and creative skills a classroom holds, while a student designed project may just be basic and super boring.\n \n Last, the amount of cheating is bound to decrease when projects are designed by students. If a kid designed his own project over a span of a couple months, there's a big possibility he may cheat. These kids may also \"accidentally\" choose the same topic to work on all summer. There are endless possibilities and ways for a students to get away with the easy way out. Which is why, when a teacher assigns different topics and types of projects to a wide variety of students, it reduces cheating. This ultimately does help the students learn how to try new things, even if they aren't familier with it.\n \n Although this may be true, many believe that when teachers assign and or design summer projects for students, it will come out boring and no fun. People also believe it won't bring out the creative side in a student. But, the understanding of a student being creative and crafty is how they handle something that is thrown at them. The creativeness that lies in a student is how they can transform something out of their interest into something they can enjoy. Teacher designed projects bring out the capability of a kid and what that kid can truly do.\n \n All in all, summer projects are genuinely more productive and useful when designed by a teacher. It gives the students a chance to be creative and show unique skills, reduces the amount of unloyal actions such as cheating and working together, and it sets the standard for a student to meet. To all teachers who will read this, I advise you to keep the power in your hands. Bring out that student's inner strengths and challenge that student. One day, that student will thank you for not letting them take the easy way out.",

It would also allow students to design a project about something that may interest them.\n \n If students design their own project they can voice their opinions on something there concerned about. Say for instance a student was worried about people speeding through his neighborhood. He could make his project about that concern and talk about ways or measures that should be put in place to prevent it from happening. This would also make the student work harder due to the fact that this is a problem that the student faces and would want people to know about that problem so that others can be informed on that issue.\n \n Student designed projects allow students to create a project on a subject that interests them. For example,say a student is interested in becoming a mechanic after they are done with school. If they research and design a project on that subject it can give them an outlook into the future if that is an occupation they are interested in. It can also give them a head startÂ in that career path with the knowledge they would learn from creating the project.\n \n If the project is teacher designed it can help students get ready for next year with school related material. This may be true but if the students get to choose how they will design the project it gives them multiple subjects and opportunities to design a project about something that intrigues and interests them. Which they will find way more exciting to complete than a teacher designed project. By designing their own projects students can get information on an occupation,talk about an issue thats affecting the world or their community,and voice their opinions on topics they are passionate about.

      "Summer projects keep the mind sharp. However often tedious, summer projects can often be beneficial as it can prepare the students for the following year or preferebly life. Some believe that these projects should be teacher designed so that students have the base kowledge on what will be covered that year, however that's not what learning is about. Learning is a life long journey not a journey to the next test. If these summer projects were student designed, where students had the freedom to choose, they could work on a something they truly found interesting. These projects could give them life experience rather than school experience.\n \n Firstly, these summer projects can be anything from work experiece to writing a noval. For example if a student loved to write and thought they may have a carreer as a jounalist or even an author they may decide their time was best spent on sharpening those skills. Not only would their time be spent to make themselves a better writer but also they would excited to do the work. However what if a student decides to make their project a job or even an internship at some law firm, well that is even better. These students will come back to school with more maturity, life experience and perhaps some money in the bank.\n \n Another outcome of student designed summer projects is rather than coming back the school with dred and resentment, they'll come back excited to showcase what they've learned. For example if teachers assigned a massive work load on everything they might need to pass the tests during the year, students will be anxious, unmotivated and stressed by the first day of school. This would kill students desire to learn and cause resentment towards teachers. However, if students can come back to school with the confidence that they are able to learn and experiece things by themselves, students will come into school postive and inspired to learn rather than being negative and unmotivated.\n \n Finally, there is a difference between schooling and learning. Schooling is a soley a tool to educate individuals however it is temporary. Learning is rather a life long jouney, something that should never stop. There is learning before school such as when you learned to walk and talk for the first time and then there is learning after school when you get a job or simply when you read a book. That is why summer projects should be the students responsibility, so that they can learn to learn by themselves. Sadly too many students believe that learning and schooling are the same thing and their life long jouney ends once they leave school.\n \n In conclusion, summer projects should be the students responsibility. These summer projects should inspire students to learn and experience new things. The goal is to have students motivated when they return to school rather than stressed and anxious for the year to end. Lastly learning is a life long jouney, schooling is temporary.",

      "One of the most truly modern American experiences has got to be voicing one's opinion on a subject they have little to know knowlege or experience with to the world. Unfortunately, today my opinion will not be voiced to the world as this is a SOL test, but it will be a scarecly informed opinion for sure. I have the privilige of never being assigned a project by a school over the summer, but today's prompt has drawn something to my attention that I never quite thought about before- That these summer projects assigned by schools should absolutely be designed by the students who have to do them as they can then be tailored to fit the students interests and schedules, within reason of course.\n \n Starting off positive, the most obvious pro of student designed summer projects is the creative liberty. Students would not only be free to pick whatever topic or subject they like, but the form their project takes. A student could go the conventional route and do a presentation with a trifold or something similar, or go in the opposite direction and hold a workshop explaining why purple light doesn't technically exist, complete with interactive features. They may even incorporate their other summer activities into their project, as a student traveling to France for the summer might research a part of French history and include their own photos that they took that relate to the topic. Speaking of other summer activities, students with jobs, internships, or anything else that may take up multiple hours of the day could then ensure that the project they give themself is something that they can handle.\n \n Now that I've explained all the wonderful pros of student designed projects, lets reign it back in a bit and disscuss the cons and some solutions to those cons along with my mildly valid expertise. I've been a girl scout since I was in elementary school and for the past few summers been doing research for a gold award project, the highest honor that a girl scout can earn. The main focus of a gold award is of course the project, which is designed entirely by the scout, may take anywhere from a couple of months to a year, and a proposal of said project has to be approved by a council.\n \n Granted, this is on a bit of a larger scale compared to a school summer project, but there are some good ideas that could be drawn from this. Approval of the project idea could ensure that the projects have genuine learning value, and could be approved by the student's counselor. Conselors would then also see to that students give themselves proper workloads, ensuring that they don't overwork themselves, or take the easy route either. Putting a deadline on the approval might also help encourage students to at least think about their project a bit before the night it's due. Gold awards also look good on college applications, and allowing students to make their projects something that they would be so proud of to put on a college application could be a boost in motivation for those college-bound.\n \n The concept of allowing students to have this much control over a project as we move towards an education system where the students are being allowed more control and freedom day by day can be truly great when done correctly. Which can absolutely happen, when necessary restraints are given. It simply requires more work on everyone's part, and considering that educational instititions are supposed to be preparing entire generations for life itself, and not just a workplace or university, that shouldn't be too hard? Perhaps I put too much faith in this but I truly do hope to see the day when students are proactive enough to go about these sorts of things on their own, not for a grade or award, but to better themselves and the world around them.",

      "Summer break is a long three months away from school for students to relax, learn new skills and enjoy themselves. Most students tend to forget everything they are taught throughout the school year over this break. Summer break to majority of students is time for having the best time of their lives doing all the things they love which hardly ever includes academic work. Teacher-designed summer projects would be a very 3 way to ensure students keep receiving knowledge throughout their summer break because education is a continuous process. Teachers would be the best choice to design these summer projects because they thoroughly know the syllabus of the course they teach, they would give realistic projects students can complete on time and teachers would be fair in selecting the type and criteria of the project.\n \n Teachers have all the information about the courses they teach and what their students need to know each year. Teacher-designed projects would entail the necessary topics and lessons for students to work on during their summer break. Other people might argue that the students are also well informed about what they are being taught so should create their own summer projects but most students might just have an idea about what they need to know but might not know about the course in detail as much as the teacher does with all their years of experience and trying new approaches to figure out what works best for their students. Students might also just want to create projects that would be very easy to complete just so they can get it over with. At the end of the day if students are allowed to create their own projects they end up learning nothing new because it was based on stuff they already knew. For example a Geometry teacher teaching tenth graders would not create a math project for tenth grade students based on sixth grade math because that is way below them.\n \n With teacher designed-projects they are more likely to have realistic amount of work and would be possible for students to complete and meet the goal at the end of the break, teachers would most definitely not give too much work to overburden students since they also need some rest or too little work to students but give them just enough work for the break. But if student-designed projects are used students are more likely to create very short and straight to the point projects because most students are lazy and just do not want to be bothered with any work so would not want to challenge themselves to research and do more but would want very few questions that would not need any serious thinking and application of knowledge. A teacher who teaches a 12th grade English class could give a summer project for students to read and summarize a book of their choice and find out the meanings of 20 new words in the book but students would have probably wanted a project where they just write out ten new words from the book they read.\n \n Every student always wants the easy way out of everything so if allowed to create a summer project would just create a project based on what they are very good at for example; a project with artwork, a crossword puzzle or a project about their own sentences and this would lead to a disagreement among the students to pick the best project which would be good for everyone. However, a teacher would not be biased in choosing a summer project for their students, they would assign a project based on skills all their students are expected to know or already have without picking out what some particular people would want in that class.\n \n Ultimately, teachers know the best approaches and methods when it comes to projects for their students because they have worked with many different students over the years and came up with very 3 teacher-designed summer projects to help their students keep learning over the break without stressing them.

      "During the school year, a student completes set projects and curriculum in order to pass the classes which they are enrolled in. Over the summer, however, some schools require that projects should be assigned to students so that they continue to learn. I think that these projects should be student-designed because they will allow students to explore new fields, inspire creativity, and take away stress from students.\n \n Student designed projects will allows students to explore new fields that they may be interested in. If students are able to design their own summer projects, then they are able to choose a topic that is interesting to them for this project. This will allow the student to explore, research, and experiment within new fields. This exploration and research of new fields is very beneficial because it helps students find a career path based on what topics they are interested in.\n \n Having student-designed summer projects will inspire creativity. If a student is able to create their own project without need of a rubric or teacher to guide them, then this project is truly coming from the student. This will allow students to really show themselves when completing these projects. If students are just given a teacher-designed project, they are just following a rubric and completing what the teacher wants them to do. This work can be numb and boring for the students who could be using all their creativity on their own self-designed project.\n \n Student-designed projects will take away a lot of the stress that some students have during normal teacher-designed projects. Students will be less focused on doing everything right since the project is designed by them. These students will instead be able to focus on learning the material instead of stressing over getting a good grade. This will improve both the students mental health and the value in learning the student is actually receiving from a project.\n \n Schools should allow these summer projects to be student-designed. Although some may argue that teacher-designed projects are better because it guarantees that a student will learn a specific curriculum, student-designed summer projects have so many more benefits. I believe that these projects should be student-designed because they will allow students to explore new fields, inspire creativity, and take away stress from students",

      "The summer project is something that often looms over the minds' of students. We often find students bellyaching about how they are missing out on fun summer activities. More often than not, it is the teachers who assign the projects, and even though teachers are more educated on certain subjects, it would be appropriate to believe that students should design summer projects. This sort of activity over the summer would promote individuality, entrepreneurship, and personal responsibility.\n \n Some people think that individuality is not necessary in an industrial world, but really, it is the backbone of this nation and student designed projects promote such individuality. In the long term, individuality leads to higher paying jobs in the future. It is well known that if more people have high paying jobs, there will be less homelessness and a stimulated economy. As well, creativity stems from a sense of individuality. Fine arts are the future of the world as we are getting closer to not needing hard labor. The arts also jump startÂ economic progress by putting more money into the system. All this individuality leads to entrepreneurship.\n \n There is an argument to be made that not all students will be entrepreneurs, but it is important to nurture entrepreneurial practices, which can be done through aforementioned student designed projects. Entrepreneurs tend to be better off in the real world. This may sound repetitive, but we really need more people with big ideas so that the world can progress. The loss of this kind of person means the loss of all those years spent building the world from the ground up. As well, the process of designing a project could lead to students designing a business in the future. The process for creating such projects is quite involved, and it leads to more focused adults in the future. In reality though, none of this would be possible without a sense of personal responsibility.\n \n Many people in this modern world believe that the only way to become more responsible is to get a job, and while this is partially accurate, projects such as this will always nurture responsibility. For example, completion of projects lead to the student feeling more accomplished. That sense of accomplishment make students feel like accomplishing more will make them feel even better, leading to them being more responsible with projects in their future. As well, project planning in youth will lead to the individual taking charge within projects in their future. It is important to have students be proactive in their career as it will likely lead to better positions and better pay.\n \n To finish, responsibility will only develop if you let your student take charge, be it in a career or in a project. While some people may disagree, this is the truth, hard work cannot do all the heavy lifting. As a country we need to develop our youths' sense of entrepreneurship,individuality, and personal responsibility or else we will not progress as a people.",

      "Students-designed projects should always be assigned even during the school year. Students-design are more understandable that teacher-design. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Projects should be student-design so they can relate more, showcase your creativity and skills, and be more exciting for the students.\n \n Even though, teacher-design projects will be able to test our knowledge. They are not made for children the way a student- design would be. Student- design projects will relate to students more because it will be base around us. We will have total control, unlike how sum teacher-design projects have rules and guidelines that stop us from being fully open. For, example i had to do a essay about my summer adventures. I chose to write about the time i visited my grandparents in Florida. A few days went by and my teacher wanted to talk to me. She wanted me to rethink my essay because she did not feel any excitement reading it. I didn't agree with her because i always had fun with my grandparents. We would feed the sea turtles, go on night walks at the beach, and go to the board walk's carnival. She still felt as if i wasn't meet the project requirements. This project played a important role in my grade, so i accepted it and rewrote my essay.\n \n In addition student-based projects will show how creative we are. This will give students the opportunity to show off their talent and ideas. Teacher- designed projects do not always allow students to show what they are fully capable of, it only shows what they want to see. Such as, my friend Generic_Name had to do a portraitÂ for her finals in art. She sketched an amazing portrait with a lotÂ of details, so she could show her skills off. This was very risky, to much detail could throw the sketch off. Her adviser thought that she should do something simple to ensure she will get an easy A. Generic_Name wanted more that a easy grade, she wanted her artwork to inspire people and toÂ make a mark, so she went with her idea instead. Now her paint is hanging in the museum of art and is displayed every month downtown.\n \n Next, Student-designed projects will be way more fun and entertaining for students. Every year we receive projects that are boring and does not interest us. Teacher-designed project have no personality and are way to formal. Students-designed projects can be more funny, silly and excited, it can bring happiness back to school projects. For example, two teachers, Generic_Name and Generic_Name assigned the same project. Generic_Name gave her students a teacher-designed project, but Generic_Name didnt. She let her students chose their own project and gave them a rubric of what she would be looking for. Generic_Name class's project still related to science but was personalized. It showed that they really tried and had fun doing this project. She had never seen so many smiles on students faces as they presented their projects. It showed her that she made the right chose.\n \n In conclusion, these are all the reason why we should get student-designed projects. It is showed that student- designed projects can help and motivate students. Projects should be student-design so they can relate more, showcase your creativity and skills, and be more exciting for the students. In the end this will be the best for students.",

      "Most schools require students to complete summer projects. Over the years, there has been a debate if these programs should be student-taught or teacher- taught. Summer projects should be teacher- designed because, teachers have a greater knowledge of the subject, are trained to keep kids engaged, and know how to plan a lesson that students can relate to worldly.\n \n Teachers all around the world study the subject(s) that they teach. This gives them greater knowledge than any student would have. Most teachers are required to graduate college, and get a teaching degree as well, (some teachers even get their masters). That is more years of studying a single subject than any high schoolÂ studentÂ may have. Studying this single subject for many years, gives them a lot of experience, and specific knowledge to help educate a student on the subject. Although students can always learn the material, they may not have as great of knowledge as a teacher on one specific subject. Teachers have at least four years of knowledge that a students don't and thats why they're better teachers than a student.\n \n Along with four years of college, teachers must receive a teaching degree. While studying for this degree, teachers learn how to plan out lessons, and keep kids engaged. A teacher would better keep kids engaged, because they are trained to keep kids focused, and keep them involved in the material they learn in class. Weather this is; keeping kids involved in class by doing a project that is hands on, or having them start conversation to create development of their skills and knowledge. Some may argue that students would keep kids more engaged, due to how they can relate to kids their own age, teachers can relate to students too. Teachers know what its like to goo through schooling, because they had to do it too. Teachers are trained to keep students entertained, and develop their skills inside and out of the classroom.\n \n Most teachers enjoy learning about their subject they teach daily, this keeps their material relevant and reputable. Making sure that the teachers material is relevant, helps kids from around the world be able to relate to the lessons. Mr. Generic_Name, is a second grade teacher at Generic_School. Over the summers he likes to practice his teaching, by traveling the world to see if his material is still relevant in other countries. Many teachers will do this to ensure that what theyre teaching their class is resignatingÂ with each student. Keeping teachers' content relevant is a sure way to keep kids relating to the topic.\n \n Summer rprojects should be relatable, engaging, and well taught. That's why Teachers should teach Summer Projects. They've had years of experince, teachers can relate to kids, keep them engaged, and create lessons that relate to the world. Teachers are the best fit to direct summer projects.Â",

I believe summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to be more involved in what there learning and it also allows students to learn at there own speed and level.\n \n My first reason on why summer projects should be student-designed is that it allows the student to be more involvedÂ in what there learning. For example if a student receives a summer project from he or she's teacher it's highly likely that the project will be focused on everything that the student has learned before the summer. But what if the student dose not need to learn everything what if they only need to focus on certain thing that they are struggling with that's why I believe that student-designed projects would benefit students better; because it give them the opertuntitieÂ to create a project that can focus on things that they are struggling with and improve upon it.\n \n Another reason I believe summer projects should be student-designed is because it allows students learn at there own speed and level. I personally believe that the summer projects that are given to student are pretty challenging and a lotÂ of students and because of this a lotÂ of student either decides not to do the project or they cheat and end up not learning anything; thats why I feel so strongly that student should be allowed to choose and designed there own projects i believe this will help students learn without being overwhelmedÂ or overly challenged.

      "Summer assignments are never fun and many students can agree with that statement. Even though they are beneficial to continue your learning throughout your break. Summer assignments should be designed by the teachers of the course due to the fact that they are familiar with the curriculum, they understand what is needed to be tested on throughout the course, and the teacher knows what the students are capable of doing.\n \n Teachers are familiar with the curriculum and know what needs to be on your assignment to ensure that you are successful in the class. The teachers have learned that topic and are experts on the subject. Going to a college and receiving a higher education in a certain topic makes the professor best fit to decide what you should learn during your break off from school. For example in a AP Human Geography class the summer assignment was to fill in maps of the world and fill out chapter guides for the first two units. In doing this the students became familiar with the content which makes them more likely to receive a higher grade and a better understanding of the unit. This proves that when the teacher designs the assignment they are leading you to become more familiar and successful in your learning.\n \n Teachers know what is being tested in a course and what is expected for the student to know. Teachers have to teach certain things to the students while following a guideline. This tells the teacher what the student should know by the end of the year. By giving the students a summer assignment that lets them be ahead and know certain topic then it benefits the students and makes them receive a better understanding of the curriculum. In most courses there are online resources that allow the teacher to know what should be taught by the end of the year and what should be taught in a certain state. This helps the teacher decide what the summer assignments should be. Some students may think that a student-designed assignment would be easier and more beneficial. This is incorrect due to the fact that the students aren't familiar with the subject or what needs to be taught. The students also aren't responsible enough to decide what needs to be learned over their break.\n \n Teacher understand the students position since they were all in the same place at a certain point in time, therefore they will assign what they know the student is capable of doing without overwhelming them. The teacher will give the student a doable amount of work that will benefit them without stressing and overwhelming them. A teacher that taught AP Human Geo at a high school understood that students wanted a break from school and they didn't want to do useless work that wouldn't help them. Therefore he gave them a good amount of work that they could finish and learn from.\n \n Summer assignments should be teacher-designed due to the fact that teachers understand the students and understand the curriculum so they can balance an assignment that benefits the students. Teachers are more familiar with the subject and know what the students will be tested on, therefore the assignments will have a good purpose. Teachers should make the assignments because they are experts on the topics and have the students interests at heart so they can help them.",

Most teachers and parents want their student/child to think outside the box. A student led project would make students use their brain more, during their 2 month long break of not doing anything.

Supporting a student to lead his summer project would make the next generation more creative.\n \n A student led summer project would allow students to pick a topic they would enjoy. Majority of people will produce quality work if they have a passion for it. People like to work on projects they enjoy and can open their minds to. If someone likes a subject they will most likely want to pursue that subject. Some students will find the topics a teacher gives them boring and unmotivating. This is due to the fact that one person cannot satisfy everyone in the room. If a student doesn't like a topic they will not enjoy it and it will not accurately represent their academic skills. Allowing students to lead their own summer projects, means they will pick something they will enjoy and have a passion for.\n \n Doing a student led summer project would give students more independence.

It would train the next generation to take responsibility instead of blaming someone else. This would give students more preparation for the adult life.

I think they should be designed by the students after all it's our summer. I just dont think school should be pushing us like that we're to young for that. They already keep us in school for about eight or nine months then most students work really hard to get to where they need/want to be.\n \n Me personally, I would want the teachers to design the projects but only since its summer I would not be ok with that. Most students put in so much work just to get a couple more pointless projects during the summer at lease if the the students design it will be something simple, but not to simple. I already know if the teachers design it would be something that's so difficult and extra and it's the summer so they will say something like you had all the time in the world to complete this. But thats not how its supposed to be it should be something I could complete in a week or two. We shouldnt have to go to school for that long just to get stuck with some summer projects design by some teachers that probably dont even know me.\n \n Maybe if the teachers and the students designed the projects together we could come up with something. I would not care if it wasn't the summer but I can't lie projects in the summer would be smart. The only thing is I feel like the teacher would just throw something at us. If it was graded like extra credit or something when school start that would be way more motivation to get ahead way before school even start. Sometimes we just need a break, just a small one because we do so much in and out of school y'all teachers and staff don't know what goes on out of school, they never do.\n \n In conclusion, students should design their own summer projects but the teachers should check of on them to make sure they're not to easy. We work hard through out the school year just to get to the summer and i dont think it should be to hard for them or to long. During school, most teachers gives us little time to do the most difficultÂ projects in the school year, just like last year. Even tho we should be relaxing in the summer this is kind of a neat idea and would keep us on task for the next school year.

They know what students want before the students know.\n \n The schools number one priority is to teach and make students learn new information. Teachers know how to introduce new topics, ideas, and questions that'll force students to use their brain. They're aware of what children know and don't know. Teachers know that it would take too long for students to make their assignment because they haven't been taught how to grade or make a rubric to grade with.\n \n Having the teachers design the project will be easier for them to grade. They know what they want to look for in the assignment. Teachers teach, make assignments, and grade for a living, and they know what to expect. The school faculty know what we'll achieve and what we'll fail at, they making rubrics and grading systems designed for students.\n \n However, students would have fun inventing their own requirements for the assignment, but students just use what they already know. Teachers will make sure others learn because that's their job. They'll have students focus on the project, and not creating it.\n \n In conclusion, having the teacher design the classes summer project makes it easier for you and your teacher. Students shoud learn and focus on their work while teachers should make the work and focus on what the students need to learn. Teachers have more knowledge when it comes to grading, they'll make sure students contain new information, and they grade better when they use their own rubic.",

    essay:
      "Giving teachers an extra task like designing a summer based project can be hard or easy it really just depends on how you look at the situation. Teachers assignÂ projects all year, so this should be no different. There are many types of teachers that teach many different subjects that have to be remembered. Students are expected to learn numerous things in just one school year, so being assigned a summer project covering everything and adding in new topics can generate ideas for students and get them to researching on their own and teaching them selfÂ things they never knew. Teachers will be available for emails from students and or parents to ask for help or a guiding hand. A lot of the time students are asked questions by teachers throughout the school year on things they were not taught or on things they cannot remember, so being assigned a project that is in dept could save them from that one embarrassmentÂ in front of their classmates.\n \n First, students will be introduced to new topics in their project. This will get students to thinking and they will want to research since technology is the biggest thing right now. This will result in them participating and they will find out new information while completing their work. The new topics will help them learn stuff that is expected to be covered. The remembering will be first priority in their project. Students will have a variety of topics in each subject and they will be expected to complete it fully. No student is allowed to leave anything undone or uncompleted. Each student is encouraged to email their teacher or research the topics and find out any information, just saying they did not understand or they did not know what to put will be unacceptable.\n \n Secondly, every teacher will be expected to leave contact information to be reached. Students are only expected to contact their teacher for help on his or her project. This is given to every student but mainly for ones without internet. There are also students who do not have parents or anyone they can rely on to help them so the teachers information is there for anyone nobody is singled out. Parents that graduated years ago may not be able to include input to their children work because they were not taught the same or know many of the things students are taught now so they are more than welcome to contact teachers for any information pertaining to the subject, this will maybe even help parents learn something.\n \n Students should create their own projects to show what they learned all year and what they do not know. Not every child needs a guiding hand or someone to lead them in the right direction. Each student can come up with their own project to show that they remember important lessons from class meetings. The teachers should not have to take their summer time to email parents and students back about things they were taught while in school. On the other hand, few students make it to class everyday to be apart of the class discussionsÂ and are not allowed to hear the notes. A lot of the things that teachers go over during class is not put into the missing work folder. The teacher could have given out many really important points that any student could have easily not paid any attention to, misheard, or was not in class to hear. Being assigned this project can help many students learn new things or relearn something they probably did not understand.\n \n To conclude this, teacher-designed projects can not only benefit students it helps them relearn things they did not understand. Nobody is perfect and anyone is capable of not knowing the right information due to miscommunication. It is alright to ask for help if you do not understand it is recommend to students. Some things can be self taught, but still not fully understood. Having a teacher that is willing to put in the effort to help his or her students shows dedication and any student should be thankful and take the help. By the end of the school year students are probally burnt out with tons of work and this project could bring back so much information that was covered.Â",

      "Some schools will assign students projects over summer break to assure they will continue to learn school subjects. Summer is a long time and will give the students enough time to learn what is needed. There is a small debate as to whether the students or the teachers should design these projects. Although many teachers will assign and create these projects because they can make sure the students will learn what they need to learn, students should design these projects because many teachers will give to big of a project, many students might not have enough time to work on said project, and giving the student the ability to create the project will assure it can get done.\n \n The first reason to support this claim is that teachers may give to big of a project. Normally, teacher will give a student a project to work on and learn but there is no telling how big that project could be. The teacher could say to create 1 deck of study cards or to write a 10 page essay on something that student may not have learned about. And many times the student may not get the project done in a way the teacher likes because they did not get a chance to go over something like that. Lastly, sometimes the student can get anxious or nervous about having to create a project as big or small as the teacher assigns.\n \n Secondly, a student may not have the time to work on a big project. Teachers look forward to the summer just as much as kids do. Summer is a time to hang out with family or earn some money at a job. Many students simply will not have enough time to worry about creating a big school project. Everyone has responsibilities, like work, family, or just household tasks, and lots of people can not make enough time to work on summer projects. Also depending on how big the assigned project will be and how many teachers assign projects can be to much and give a student not enough time to complete them all.\n \n Lastly, if a students designs a project they can make it so that it can revolve around their schedule. A teacher will normally give students a big project and expect it to be done without thinking about how a student has a life outside of school just like a teacher. For the majority of students, they are too busy with summer responsibilities to be able to work on a teacher assigned school project. If a student is given the right to create their own project, following some small steps from the teacher, there is a higher chance that the student will get the project done rather than not complete it.\n \n In conclusion, students should be able to assign and create their own projects. Many reasons include how big the project is, how much time it will take, and how much time the student can work on it. So to make it easier on everyone, students should be able to make their own projects that can revolve around their own lives and responsibilities.Â",

      "Summer is the time of year where students all over the world finally get to relax. They do not have to worry about any responsibilities; they can just remember what it means to be a kid. However, some schools are allowed to assign projects over summer. If kids are required to constantly be thinking about school and work, they should at least be enjoying it. Students should self design any projects assigned over summer because its their own free time, everyone has unique learning styles, and teachers aren't always considerate.\n \n Children care about their summer vacations, because it is the only time they are truly free. A student looks forward to this vacation throughout the whole school year. They wait patiently, completing every assignment and every test, just so they can play outside in the summer sunshine. These kids don't want to finally get out of school to only have to complete yet another assignment. If the kids are having to do this project on their own break, they should at least be able to choose what they do. For example, if a student is assigned a project over summer from biology, they should be able to pick to do an animal studies on their own dog. An animal they know well, love, and actually would enjoy researching. Kids having to spend their vacation working should be able to choose what to work on.\n \n Kids want to play, so they should be able to and have a project that adapts to their learning style. Every student learns differently. Having a project created by one teacher would be unfair to everyone else who doesn't think the same way. Allowing students to have some decision in what they do would be most 3 in actually teaching them. Every mind learns differently and needs creative thinking involved to begin working. If kids were allowed to come up with their own projects, it would be much better than a teacher-designed project. The kids would not think of it as homework, but instead as something they want to do.\n \n Teachers don't always know whats best for their students. Many teachers may just assign homework because they need more grades in the grade book. They don't always consider if it's necessary for the students learning. They don't think about the stress that homework inflicts on it's victims. If teachers were to create a project for students to complete over summer, it would cause lots of stress and resentment. Although, letting the kids design their own projects would help build a better bond between kids and learning. Teachers would then get a better feel for each student and see how each of their individual minds work. Letting kids design their own projects would also reduce the amount of work and stress teachers have to endure. Having to come up with a project that would be easy for every student to complete is hard as it is. Having to do this before a teachers own vacation is just torture. It would be a win win situation if the kids got to design the project.\n \n If it was required that a kid got a summer project, it should be student designed. Kids are not thrilled about getting homework over their vacation, and they may not put their best effort. However, If the kids had the option to create their own project it would spark much more creativeness. Teachers would better understand their students and get a break from all the regulating. Both students and teachers would benefit from a student-designed project.",

      "Are students responsible enough to design their own school projects? Numerous schools require students to complete projects over the summer to ensure learning, but this method may be 1. If students were given the freedom to design their own projects it would lead to greater performance due to the likelihood that students will pick topics that interest them, that projects would be generalized to help students in the fields with which they require assistance, and the possibility of students forgetting about the project would be lower if they actively worked on it.\n \n However, some may disagree with this viewpoint. Some may say that designing their own projects provides students with an opportunity toÂ pick an easy topic with which they will not be challenged. Nevertheless there are other viewpoints to consider.\n \n Firstly, students, when given the opportunity, will always choose to work on a topic that interests them. Studies show that working with a topic that interest them improves the performance of students while also increasing the possibility of them making an effort to complete their work. However, this is not the only reason why students should design their own summer projects.\n \n Additionally, while some may argue that students would choose to work on topics which they find easy, the chance of a class of students all thriving in the same subjects is highly improbable. Due to the fact that some students will choose to work in subjects which they don't find challenging, students may end up choosing topics which challenge their peers and inadvertently create a project which is all encompassing. But these are not the only reasons students should design their own summer projects.\n \n Finally when any person puts considerable effort into something it causes information related to the subject becomes learned more easily. This is one of the reasons why teachers use methods such as taking notes to reinforce what students are learning. So, logically a group of students working together to choose a topic and subject which they are all satisfied with will reinforce the knowledge of such a project and therefore decrease the likelihood that students will forget about their summer projects thereby improving results.\n \n However, there are many more reasons that students should design their own summer projects.\n \n InÂ conclusion, students should have a hand in creating their own summer projects to choose topics which interest them, as well as to increase the likelihood of them completing said projects, and finally create a project in which all students may both thrive and struggle.",

      "Summer projects should be student-designed. No student likes to do projects in the summer, Students will require motivation and excitement. If students can design their own project, they can be different and more creative. Students enjoy tasks where there's no limit as to what they can do; it gives them the opportunity to try something new. This gives teachers less work and students a more thoughtful tasks. Overall, this will give students a reason to learn, even during they're break.\n \n This is a good way to assure students are still learning. It also gives the students more of a challenge and prepare them for the following school year. Students can use this as a way to see how they're doing and also to stay involved in school. If it were a teacher-designed project, most students wouldnt participate. Since the students are the ones designing it, it'll give them a little more excitement and control over the project.\n \n Students tend to work harder and be more creative when it is a self-designed project. This will open more opportunities and more ideas. Designing your own project gives students the freedom and control that they love. For example, the few times I've been able to design my own project I always put forth more effort and creativity; This is because students love to try different things and be in control. This is important because it teaches students valuable skills that they may need in the real world.\n \n If students are interested and have ideas, summer projects can be really beneficial.

      "Throughout the school year, both staff and students await summers warm arrival. As the incoming heat and sunscreen draws the final semester to an end, the dreaded thoughts of summer projects spread. Whether it be summer-readings or instructional packets, several high schools urge, if not require, teachers to assign summer projects to assure continuous learning over the two month break. Recently, however, students have debated that these projects should be student-designed rather than teacher-designed. Designing their own projects would allow students to pursue topics they interest, the creative freedom that makes their projects unique, and ensure each students ability to complete projects with the resources available to them.\n \n Often times students are required to complete a project they lack interest in. A 2013 study confirms that when students are given the opportunity to design individual assignments, they are 78% more inclined to participate and are confident of their final product. If a particular student is interested in basketball, they would be more willing to read a book and write an accompanying paper about its history rather than Mary Shelly's\n \n Frankenstein . A students eagerness to learn in specific topics strengthens their work and ensures their growth and success before the new school year.\n \n Equally as important as topic diversity is topic delivery. Reading a book and writing a paper confirming your completion year after year does little to stimulate a students brain. Offering students the creative freedom to complete their summer project will further invest them into their topic. Say a student is interested in film and designs their project on studyingÂ its evolution; instead of writing a paper, the student could make a video presentation featuring different clips and information. Allowing students to broaden their horizons will encourage critical thinking and result in a more stimulated head spaceÂ when returning to school.\n \n Another important consideration is whether or not students can access the necessary resources to complete a teacher-designed project. Several high school students are not fortunate enough to purchase a summer-reading book, supplies for a poster board, or the internet to construct a paper. When completing the project isn't a viable option, the opportunity to design their own allows them to use resources already available to them and avoid lowering their grade.\n \n Although student-designed summer projects are proven to aid learning in more ways than one, schools are still hesitant to make the shift. Teachers rebuttal saying teacher-designed projects would provide students with relevant prepÂ work for their next course and avoid any inappropriate topics that fail to exhibit student growth. Students agreed and offered to solve the inevitable conflict: students have the option of of either completing a teacher-designed project or designing and their own as long as it is teacher-approved prior to schools end.\n \n Maintaining academic activity is key to achieving higher grades and retaining long termÂ information. Even in the summer, students should practice this with assigned summer projects. Though teacher-designed projects aid a students transition into the next year, these projects can be repetitive and may struggle to entice or stimulate students. When students themselves design one, however, the passion for their topics, creative delivery, and avoiding any hindrance on unavailable necessities allow them to learn while still fulfilling what summer is all about: having fun!",

      "Summer break. The most sought after break by any student at any level. Days spent by the pool, hours of hanging with friends, and nights that run into the morning. Summer is where all knowledge learned during the previous year goes down the drain. To counter this, teachers assign summer projects. These projects are normally easy but require much time. Summer projects should be teacher designed because they prepare the student for the next year, the teacher knows what is being taught, and it gives the student a baseline of what he or she knows.\n \n Summer projects are designed by a teacher that the student will have next year. These projects need to incorporate what will happen in the upcoming year. Many first units include what was included in the summer project. Summer projects help student get ready for the new year by giving students an easy, slow paced, and minimal effort project that will help students in the long run. These projects are often worth points and can boost grades when quarters or semesters are ending.\n \n Teachers know what is being taught for the next year. They can design the assignment to reflect what will happen. Students can't do that. They don't know what is going to be taught or how the teacher teaches. If a student were to design the project, they would make it have little to no relation to the upcoming class. Students during the summer are lazy, I speak from experience, and the last thing they want to do is school work. When they design their own work, it is sloppy; lazy; and unrelatedÂ to the class.\n \n Lastly, the summer project gives an honest and unbiased evaluation of what the student already knows and what they don't know. The assignment is students' first test, and students can give themselves an honest evaluation of themselves. How much did I have to Google? Did I ask my friends for help? How long did it take me? These are all questions that they can ask themselves. These questions and project will show how much work they will need to put in during the school year.\n \n Some might say that students can prepare themselves betterÂ for the school year than the teacher can. They don't need to have the teacher to assign them work. The weakness in that argument is that students are over confident in their abilities on what the know and don't know. As a student in high school, I constantly believe that I am smarter than I truly am. Students will think they know more than they really do and will already be behind before the school year starts.\n \n Teachers design these projects to help and prepare the student. It gives an honest evaluation of students' abilities and knowledge. More teachers should assign summer projects to keep students' brains engaged. This helps them prepare for the next year while also seeing what the teacher wants. The teacher knows the subject better than the student; teachers should assign summer projects not students.Â",

      "Benefits of Student-designed Projects\n \n Summer projects are to keep students learning during summer break but most kids don't find the projects entertaining. Student-designed projects can improve their creativity and make them want to complete the project. Also, teachers will be more excited and looking forward to seeing the outcome of students work. Schools should really think about making more projects student-designed. Summer projects should be student-designed because more students will want to participate, increase creativity, and boost their self-esteem.\n \n In schools, participation from students is very important and student-designed summer projects are a great way to increase excitement and participation. If students could come up with their own projects and enjoy the work that they are doing, plenty of other students will want to do the project. In addition, students will see their peers coming up with their own kind of project and will want to join in by making a project themselves. For example, a student can see one of their friends making a project and can tell that the friend is having fun while doing it. This will encourage the student to join in on the student-designed project and make them want to do the project more. This proves that summer projects should be student-designed.\n \n Secondly, student-designed projects can increase creativity throughout students. Projects already help with creativity but having a student design a project can really increase it. For example, my art teacher had the class come up with different ideas for our next piece of art work. There were so many creative thoughts going around that my teacher had us make our own unique thing. As I worked on the project, I could really see my creative side show and everybody else's too. Having students design their own projects for the summer is really good for the next school year. For instance, students developing and finding out how creative that can be will improve grades and talent. This proves that summer projects should be student-designed.\n \n Self-esteem is an important factor in the real world, having students design a project can help them improve their confidence. A student knowing that they completed a project, they've made, will make them proud of themselves. In addition, using the project in other classes, and getting recognized for designing a good project will drastically increase their self-esteem. Students-design summer projects will increasingly let students know that they can do any thing they put their minds too. Self-confidence will provide students with better outcomes, motivation and even they will feel more confident in the work they are putting out. In this paragraph, I proved that summer projects should be student-designed.\n \n Some opponents believe that teacher-designed projects should be used for summer projects. Also, they may feel as if it will be easy on students and a better way of learning. However, giving students a easy way isn't always the best thing to do. Having students design a project has better outcomes in the long run. For example, having a teacher design a project and give it to students may not help students become more creative or participate or even gain self-esteem from it. So, a teacher-design project for the summer, in my eyes, is not the best thing to have students grow and improve in certain positions.\n \n In conclusion, keeping students active and learning during the summer by having student-design projects has plenty of benefits. In addition, this can have a better impact on students as well as be more exciting and entertaining to students. Three benefits for student-design summer projects are it will make students want to participate, increase creativity, and boost their self-esteem. This proves that summer projects should be student-designed.Â Â",

      "When we think of break, whether it's Spring, Summer or Winter, we tend to think of it as something where we can relax after a long period of work or school, however, during these breaks, many of us play sports, have jobs or preform other activities during this time off. It's important to keep in mind that many students preform various activities when discussing a summer assignment. Some schools offer up this assignments, that way students are able to learn during break. The question isn't whether summer assignments are necessary or not, because having prior knowledge going into a class is important, but rather the question is whether the summer assignments should be be comprised of questions made by teachers or questions made by students. Having questions created by students, will make the summer assignments much more useful.\n \n If you ask any student who pays attention in a certain class about the way they feel about that class, they're sure to give you a wide array of emotions that they felt toward certain topics or units. For example, if you ask a student their thoughts on unit 7, they are able to tell you if it was hard or easy and if it was on the difficult side, they would be able to tell you what kind of questions confused them. having this foresight is very important when creating questions, you are able to give other students more exercises for the questions you think are more difficult.\n \n Another reason why it is more beneficial for students to create summer assignments rather than teachers, is because teachers tend to over prepare students which could become damaging. \"Overprepare\" can mean that you know the bare minimum and more, which does apply to teachers summer assignments, however, knowing too much unnecessary information can make you forget important information. Overcrowding summer assignments with non vital knowledge can also be discouraging to students, and it will make them not want to attempt the work.\n \n Overall, having student created questions will benefit other students taking that class, because, at the end of the day, students understand what it's like to be a student. A student is not just a person who attends a form a schooling but an actual person. Students need time for sports, jobs they may have, or even just socializing and hanging out with friends. Other people who understand these struggles, should be the ones who ultimatley be in control of the questions.",

      "As a child, I, as well as most others, desperately counted the days until summer break. In the classroom, we had a bright, beach themed poster boardÂ with the school days remaining plastered in big, bold letters in the middle. On my sports teams, we always had fun and easy practices during the last week of school. I always looked forward to summer, especially when everyone else was so enthusiastic about it. However, this changed as I got older when I was introduced to summer assignments. They felt like the exact opposite of summer. They were boring and restrictive, so I always procrastinated doing them until the very end. Today, many school systems are looking to implement summer projects, as they can help tackle the lost and wasted time during the summer. Simultaneously, it is important that schools don't impose overly restrictive projects that take away what it means to be on summer break. One solution to this is to implement student-designed projects. These allow students to create what they want their summer project to be. Although many may say teacher-designed summer projects better preserve the students' learning, student-designed projects are overall superior because they give more freedom, creativity, and flexibility for the students during their summer break.\n \n Student-designed summer projects are a phenomenal chance to give students more freedom and let them be creative. In school, students have very few opportunities to express their creativity, so summer break is seen by many as a chance to break away from overly structured school days. Forcing students to follow a teacher-designed project will only remove its specialty, and further limit chances students have to be creative. On the other hand, student-designed projects could be the spark needed by some to make use of their summer. Additionally, if students feel the teacher-designed projects were too restrictive, there is a chance they would put as little effort into them as possible, or forgo them entirely. If this happens, it is a waste of time for both the student and the teacher. In my own experience, I have seen that most summer assignments had very little or no impact on my grade, so it often made far more sense not to do them. However, when teachers did try to tie these assignments to a grade, lots of students and parents complained. Whereas, when students are able to design a project about something they are passionate about, this is far less likely to happen, and could even lead to further interest about that topic.\n \n Another important aspect of summer projects is the various time restraints every student has. Students may have sports, vacations, jobs, and many other activities. Designing a project which accommodates everyone's complex and ever-changing needs can be impossible. By allowing students to design the project, much of this problem is eliminated. They know the time they have better than anyone else, so they can design a project which fits far better to their own schedule. If students were able to design their own projects, they could even tie it into the activities they're already doing. This way, they're able to gain the benefits of a summer project, while not having to change much about their summer. Not having enough time is another reason why some students may not do their summer project, but can have other, additional, consequences. With a teacher-designed project, if students don't have the time to complete it, they may look towards cheating off of others, since everyone is following the same project. This not only negates any benefits of a summer project, but can also lead to some downsides. If a student cheats on a summer project because they didn't have the time to do it, they may feel encouraged to cheat again in the future, even if they wouldn't have otherwise. With a student-designed project, cheating is much less of a problem. Not only are there far fewer reasons to cheat, but it's much harder to as well, since every student has their own project, they can't simply copy off of what someone else has done.\n \n Many people may say that teacher-designed projects would be far better to maintain students' learning and allow them to learn new things, but this is untrue. It is far easier for students to learn new things if it's about a topic they're interested about; whereas, students may not absorb any knowledge about a topic they have no interest in. Even if student-designed projects were worse for learning, their other benefits still outweigh their downsides. Student-designed projects are a great way to develop creativity, and they let students with naturally high creativity use it, which they aren't given many chances to in school. Student-designed projects are also much better for students' time constraints, which will encourage more students to do the project.\n \n As more school systems begin to adopt summer projects, it is crucial that these projects are student-designed. Summer projects are important to build and preserve learning from throughout the year, but are extremely limiting on students freedom, creativity, and flexibility.Â By giving students the capability to design their own projects, it restores much of what is lost by giving them summer work. Student-designed projects also help to avoid many of the possible downsides of teacher-designed ones. Because of the lack of freedom and the inability to tailor a project to everyone schedule, teacher-designed projects can often lead to students cheating, or not doing the work at all. By putting students in the driver's seat of their own project, they can find a project that is enjoyable and encourages themselves to do it. By using student-designed projects, schools can obtain the needed balanced between a useful summer and an enjoyable one.",

      "Summer break is the biggest part of the year that students look forward to. Students want to have fun with friends and just relax, however, students are still required to continue learning throughout their break in order to retain information they've learned over the school year. Consequently, students are assigned teacher-designed summer projects. Some people may say that teacher-designed summer projects are 3, however, student-designed projects are better because it would be more enjoyable for the students and it will have more diverse topics.\n \n First of all, having students design their ownÂ projects would be a lot more enjoyable for students because they have the freedom to choose their own topics. For example, the famous filmmaker and entrepreneur Walt Disney was not always successful with his work. At the start of his career he drew little art work pieces for a small local newspaper company, although he wasn't able to profit from his drawings that much, he still loved his job because it was something he wanted and loved to do. It can be seen that people are able to go through tough times if they are able to express themselves freely. Another example would be is when my science class was assigned a group project and students had the freedom to do whatever they wanted to do. My group decided to do it on climate change, which wasn't very appealing to me at the time, but as I learned and dug in deeper into the topic, I found it more and more interesting which led to me being more educated in climate change and gaining new knowledge made it was more memorable. This shows that when students have the freedom to choose and design their own projects; it helps students learn something they never knew about, which leads to students being more educated.\n \n Secondly, letting students design their projects will lead to more diverse topics. Students are always taught to follow a rubric which can be stressful; consequently, students are limited when it comes to expressing their thoughts and opinions. In fact, during my English class, students were split into groups and we were all assigned the same topic to debate about and we were also assigned which side to take on the topic. This lead to students being confused and frustrated because they didn't know what to talk about because they didn't agree with what they were assigned, which lead to the debate being very confusing and vague; students from all groups were stating the same basic reasonings with no interesting details. It can be seen that it's hard to describe or discuss about certain topics when there's no diversity of thoughts. On the other hand, during my history class, the whole class held a debate on a topic where students were given the choice to pick which side they wanted to take. As a result, students from both sides were able to share their thoughts and opinions on the topics, which led to students from bothÂ sides giving diverse, different, and interesting ideas and students were able to learn from each other. Every person is different and everyone has different thoughts that people can learn from one another.\n \n Some say that teacher-designed projects are better because teachers are more experienced and know what's better for the students, however, that reasoning is flawed due to the fact that every student is different and some students need more freedom in education. For example, studies have shown that when students are given work that's confusing or notÂ enjoyable; they procrastinate until the due date and the scores and grades are often lower. However, when students are given the opportunity to choose their own topics and work on what they want to do, they take more responsibility and complete the task on time with a higher score. Teachers being more experienced than students may be true, but giving students a chance and letting them work on their own may show better results. Often times, students are too focused on grades and rubrics, which can be stressful and upsetting when they receive a bad grade for their work they thought was good, however, when students follow their own rules and knowledge it'll be more rewarding when they receive a good grade and it'll be easier for students to find what they lack and need to work on, to improve when they receive a bad grade.\n \n In conclusion, students should have the freedom to choose and design their own summer projects because it'll give the students a chance freely express themselves. Students today have a lot of information thrown at them during the school year and having to retain all that information throughout summer is very difficult, but having students forcefully research and learn about a topic they don't like would be very discouraging and not very 3. Learning is an important part of life, but students should still have the freedom to research and work on something they want to do.Â",

    essay:
      "Have you ever been assigned a project that you did not want to work on? This regularly happens to many students, due to a variety of reasons. Although summer projects are slightly different than those assigned during the school year, they cause similar problems. The student might have been lazy, did not have enough time to work on the project, or the topic did not interest them. While schools cannot help much with the former two reasons, they can with the latter reason. Teacher-designed projects can be biased, affecting the student's ability to gain a wide understanding of a topic. Additionally, teachers tend to assign projects on topics that students do not see much importance in, as the topic does not seem to affect the student in any way. For these reasons, summer projects should be student-designed to allow students to be more passionate about the project, be creative, and be more self-reliable.\n \n Student-designed projects allow students to be passionate about the topic they are working on, causing them to work efficiently. When students are assigned teacher-designed projects, they are not usually excited to work on the assignment. Additionally, they do not value it as important, leaving the work until the last minute. For example, in 7th grade, my Life Science class was assigned a project about the deer population in Virginia. Many of the students did not actively work on the project, as they found the topic boring. Because they did not understand the relevance of the topic, the students were not passionate about the project. An independent project assigned in my AP Lang class, however, had a different result. The assignment was to write a research paper on a social issue that interested us. Because students were able to write about an issue that interests them, they actively worked on the project. Being passionate about a project also affects a student's performance in class. For example, because the majority of the class was not passionate about the deer project, they did not do well on it. However, on the AP Lang assignment, the majority of the class did well on related assignments, as they were passionate about the projects they worked on.\n \n Summer projects designed by students allow for creativity. Students are able to express themselves, as they are not restricted by strict guidelines the way they are with teacher-designed projects. Because of this reason, students are more likely to actively work on the project and put in more effort. For example, my AOS biology class was assigned a project to research and present information about a group of proteins. We were allowed to present this information in any way we wanted, allowing for creativity. The majority of the students were very excited to work on the project, as they thought of fun ways to present their information. Some students created songs to relay their information, whereas others made fun videos to do so. A few students even baked cakes to provide information about their proteins. Each student actively worked on their project and put in effort to make sure it was done well. The element of creativity allowed the students to see the assignment as a fun project, rather than as a boring task. Because the majority of the students worked hard on the project, they did well on it. Furthermore, they 3ly retained the information they researched, allowing them to do well on the corresponding test.\n \n By allowing projects to be student-designed, schools allow students to develop a sense of self-reliance. This is because the students have to conduct their own research in order to find a topic that interests them, rather than just receive a topic from the teacher. For example, in elementary school, students come up with their own experiments to test, after which they present their findings at the science fair. By doing so, students learn how to depend on themselves to find information. Similarly, sophomores at the Generic_School take a research class. They work on a wide variety of projects that are mostly assigned by teachers, but towards the end of the year, they must come up with an independent research project that they will work on in their junior year. In order to choose their project, students have to conduct extensive research to understand the topic, as their project cannot have been done before. Additionally, they have to continue conducting research in junior year to allow for a wider understanding of the topic. This allows the students to be self-reliant, as they know more about their project than their teacher, who acts as a mentor. Self-reliance is a very important skill that helps people succeed in the community and workplace when they become an adult, so it is important to establish the skill early on.\n \n Some people may believe that allowing students to design their own projects creates more work for teachers, putting stress on them. The teachers cannot have a uniform grading rubric and must have enough background knowledge on each student's topic in order to grade them fairly. However, by allowing summer projects to be student-designed, teachers do not have to come up with a topic themselves. Additionally, they are exposed to a wide variety of projects, allowing them to be more interested in the presented material. This allows teachers to be more likely to grade the projects fairly, as they do not have to repeatedly look at the same information.\n \n In conclusion, self-designed projects allow students to be passionate about the topic, resulting in the creation of better projects. Students can demonstrate their creativity, allowing them to 3ly retain the learned information. They also become more self-reliant, which will help them when they get a job. Rather than assigning teacher-designed projects over the summer, schools should assign student-designed projects to stimulate learning, as well as shape students to gain skills that will help them succeed when they become an adult.",

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. A teacher-designed school project is a way to communicate with upcoming students through the introduction of the new curriculum. However, a student-designed project allows students to choose their own topic. The students would have complete control over their summer project, permitting them to prove what they are individually capable of. Summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to explore their own interests, it gives students more freedom to be creative, and is less stressful.\n \n Students should be able to design their own projects so that they can indulge themselves in matters that personally interest them. For example, students would put more effort into a project they are interested in, rather than one assigned to them. Researching topics that are unappealing does not encourage a higher quality outcome in an assignment. The freedom to explore other topics that are more personal and relatable gives students the power to prove they understand their project. Also, students have more freedom in their presentation. They are allowed to represent their knowledge through the projects in whatever form they believe fits best. This way, teachers are able to see work habits and the effort students provide in their project's display. Freedom in choosing their own topics truly allows students to learn about what they desire.\n \n Another reason in favor of student-designed projects is the capability of creativity. A personal project allows students to create their work however they see fitting. Students can design and display their summer's worth of research in their own creative ways. Students creating their own projects freely will provide better, more creative outcomes. In addition, teacher-assigned projects teach kids to follow a rubric and limit their own creativity. Students will put less effort into a project with specific guidelines because they are less interested and feel constrained to the task's specific guidelines. Developing their own projects allows them to be free-thinking, and provide a creative project that accurately represents their efforts. Student-designed projects allow for more creativity than teacher-designed projects.\n \n Finally, student projects are less stressful than a teacher-assigned project. For example, all students creating the same exact project encourages academic competition. Competing to create and develop a better project than friends and peers introduces more stress to students. A summer project should not be used to stress students, for the students will recieve unwanted and false ideas about the stress and workload of school. Also, unwanted stress can cause the students to cheat on or disregard their assignments. The pressure of a teacher-designed project could drive students to copy another students' work. Other students, who are notÂ engaged in a teacher-designed project, might completely blow off the project, and waste their summer unproductively. Stress drives students to make projects more trouble than they are worth.\n \n Student-designed summer projects are clearly a better choice than teacher-designed projects. Students are permitted to research and report on their own interests and what applies to them. Creativity in their projects is derived from the freedom to complete their work in their own way. Student-designed projects take away from the amount of stress added from teacher-assigned projects and their elaborate rubric and grading systems. A student's own project can display one's hardworking capabilities towards a set of academic goals.",

    essay:
      "Summer projects are something a student always dreads during vacation, maybe your at the pool and you remember that you have to do a research paper for your science class that has to be turned in on the first day of school. So you get ready to work on it but you dont know what to do it on and you get stuck since your supposed to choose the topic and the format your research paper is going to be in. Giving students the opportunity to design there own project is good, but students forget so much during vacations that they have no prior knowldedge or forget how to do certain things. This is why Teacher designed projects during the summer are a better idea then student designed projects. Since students can understandably be too busy enjoying there vacation they can forget how to do certain things or have problems making decisions for there projects. on the other hand if teachers design these projects they can make a rubric on what to include points, topics, and even examples and if any students are confused they can just email the teacher. Ive had experience with a teacher designed project or assignment and it turned out way easier then I thought it would be even when I had difficulties me and my teacher were able to work out a solution so I could finish the project.\n \n Summer vacation for students is a time to relax go travel or visit other family members maybe get ready for a summer sport. Most students wont even think about there work until the last month of vacation when this happens thats when students start to panic. Projects can also be hard if a student goes out of country for the summer and doesnt have acess to technology at all times and struggle to create a project that gets high points. Even if students have acess to technology, during large gaps like summer vacation students can tend to forget many things they learned during the school year since they arent really learning anything. Students are more likely to get a better grade on there projects if they are given certain tasks that they have to do to complete there project so that they dont stress out over the work they have to do.\n \n In comparison Teacher designed projects can be easier to follow since most teachers will leave specific directions that you have to accomplish. This takes away from the stress of coming up with something yourself and sometimes wasting time looking for the right topics. Teacher projects can vary depending on classes like for instance an English might make you read a book then give a report on it and they give you a series of books that you can choose from. Most Teacher projects have a goal or something they want you to accomplish ,so its really clear what they want you to do and how to execute it to get the best grade possible. Reaffirming my statement most teachers will give a rubric or packet to show what you have to do and maybe even examples so you can have a better idea of what they want from you. This method can give students a clear picture of what they need to do and they can plan what work they should complete now and which to do later. Even then students might still be confused so if they really are stuck they can just email the teacher since most teachers will give there email before summer break begins just in case students have questions.\n \n I had a experience with my AP government teacher where before the class had even started he had left us a assignment/project to do. He explained that this project was so we could start the year sprinting and fly through the first couple of units so we could get to the important topics about government. I went travelling to visit my family in Canada and didnt start doing the project until there was a month left. everything seemed pretty easy by itself and everything was clear, but I was supposed to print the the documents after I had finished completing them and I didnt have a printer. I was able to email him to see what I could do and he recomended I just answer the documents in paper and to just hand it to him when school started. i was able to have a nice summer and still do the work and when school came by i was able to give him the work.\n \n Even though teacher designed projects are a bit easier and straight to the point it doesnt give you much option to be creative or do much else. Student projects can be more fun and give a greater sense of purpose since your choosing what your going to do for your project. This gives room to people who are really passionate and creative about theyre topic and they create amazing things. by putting restrictions and limiting the ammount that these people can do it makes them feel less motivated and makes it seem like they are just doing simple work instead of doing something special. this can hurt them and maybe even make them lose interest in the class that they generally like.\n \n In conclusion even though Student projects offer more purpose Teacher designed projects are more simpler and easier to understand so students dont have to stress when they are in vacation. Teachers provide clear directions and can offer help when needed so students can focus on being with there familys and relax. Students can have a rough time doing there projects if they are given vague instructions for doing it and they end up wasting time and not making a good final product. From my experience i was able to complete my work and work through troubles I had with my teacher so I do believe that Summer projects should be Teacher designed.Â",

      "These summer projects should be student designed for sure. It shows which students who are willing to apply themselves and show how creative they are, which would separate them from the rest. This would in return create a bias with the teacher.\n \n If summer projects were designed in such a way where the student led their own idea with what to do with said topic, this would ulimtatly separate students from each other. I refer to this as \"the breaking point\". I refer to it as \"the breaking point\" because it shows which students who are willing to apply themselves, who are trying with mediocre effort or don't care at all. It builds discipline and character. If you are willing enough to take the extra mile and go out of your way to make this project the best ever, then that proves to your teacher that you are the one who wants it, you are the one to ask questions, you are the one to make it. Some students would probably set them selfÂ up for failure and try to find the easy way too workout around said project. All this shows is that they wish to take the wide path that life has set before us and not the narrow path with temptations that build that discipline. This project should be meant for who wants it, not for what its really on. It should basically be an assessmentÂ to see what level of goat they are on.\n \n Now there is a very great con to my argument. That con my friend has a name, and her name is, bias. With going with the plan on doing said project create a very huge bias within teachers. Once they see who was very willing to apply themselves and who wasn't, they'll most likely start to prematurely pick and choose favorites. I say this because they'll start to imagine how well this student will do in their class and how terrible the next would. Come school time, the kids won't know it, but the teacher already has a secret disliking for some of the students. It's to hell with them basically. It's hard for us students to overcome such a bias from a mistake we made. Even if we start acing the teachers class, they'll probably jump to conclusions and assume we have cheated all year or something. This project is a great cause with two possible outcomes: A great upbringing or a terrible downfall. But see, you might have though that I am swaying you away from actual argument but here's where the good comes in. This project brings out the teachers true character as well, we can see if the teacher is really loving as people say they are no matter what, or will their true colors show? This whole thing is one big assessment on everyone's moral values. Are you a fan or a hater?\n \n In conclusion, life is what it is. Bias or not, let the kids show who they are and who THEY want to be. Don't allow teachers to solely let the do what they want but instead let a student explore his mental. Let us breathe and thrive in life. Let us learn from our own mistake and not be carried on the shoulders of someone else.

I agree with teachers assigning students a summer project because it lets the students be creative and learn in a fun way.\n \n I agree that summer projects should be student designed because it will show what the students have learned and it would show what they need to improve on. Students will be learning more because the students would be researching to find information and they would learn new information. Students can learn and be involved with the project and it would raise your grade if it is low.

      "Summer vacation is a time of rest, relaxation, and recreation for public school students across the nation. However, this break is also well-known for creating significant academic setbacks for these students and causing them to struggle in their return to school. To solve this common issue, many schools have started to require their students to complete a summer project in order to maintain their academics outside of school. Although these projects would be more educationally beneficial for the students if constructed by the teachers, the summer projects should be student-made because the students are more likely to enjoy the project, there is a higher probability of the students completing the project, and the efforts of the students to do a high-quality project are increased.\n \n To begin with, the summer break projects should be constructed by the students because they are more likely to enjoy the project. In today's society, many students enjoy creating things that they thought of themselves and were not assigned by a teacher or parent. Consequently, if these projects were created by teachers, the students would say that the topic that the teachers selected for the project was not interesting enough and would not be as motivated to complete the assignment. If these projects were created by the students, they would not feel forced to do the project. Instead, they would leave for summer vacation already anticipating starting this fun and exciting new activity. In conclusion, schools should allow students to create their own summer project because the students are more likely to enjoy it.\n \n In addition, the allowance of a student-constructed summer project would increase the probability of completion by the students. If the students are permitted to complete a project of their own invention, their motivation to do it will increase because they are guaranteed to enjoy the topic of the project. Teacher-constructed projects are not likely to suit the interests of each of their students. This results in a percentage of the students not enjoying the topic of the project, losing motivation to do what was assigned, and eventually not completing the project at all. This can be avoided if the topic of the summer project was student-selected because each student would be doing something that they are interested in. To conclude, students should be allowed to select their own summer project instead of the teachers selecting it because their motivation to complete the project is guaranteed to increase significantly.\n \n Finally, schools should permit students to pick their own summer project because the chance that students will construct a project of higher quality will increase. Students completing a project that they are interested in are proven to spend more time and effort on their assignment. Forcing students to construct a project that they are not interested in is the easiest way to receive a low-quality project. In order to prevent students from creating an unambitious and lazily-made project, schools should permit students to choose what project they will be doing. This ensures that every student is doing something that they will be guaranteed to enjoy. To summarize, the allowance of student-constructed projects increases the probability that schools will receive high-quality projects on their return.\n \n In conclusion, the summer projects should be student-made because the students are more likely to enjoy the project, there is a higher probability of the students completing the project, and the efforts of the students to complete a high-quality project are increased. The projects mandated by these schools will create a new generation of inquisitive and ambitious students. The students who complete these interactive and enjoyable projects are more probable to enjoy school on their return and have an increase in motivation and ambition regarding their academics. Allowing the students to construct these summer break projects instead of the teachers is the best possible decision that America's schools could ever make for the future generations of today's society.",

      "For many students, summer projects are a useless task forced upon them by their teachers. These assignments can be detrimental to the continuity of the students' learning. Without the freedom to stray from the normal, one may become expectant of nothing more. Student led assignments give highschoolers the opportunity to be creative in their learning, learn responsibility, and prepare them for the future.\n \n During the school year, students are expected to learn through the guidance of the teacher. While some people enjoy this structure, many feel their creativity is being repressed. A survey done on high schools students, asking about how they feel they have the ability to represent themselves through schoolwork, 75% feel that they do not have the option to express themselvesÂ with their current workload. With a self-led summer project students could continue learning through the break, by studying a topic that interestsÂ them which, in turn, inspires them to create a more thought out end result.\n \n Responsibility, a skill hopefully learned by students through school, is not easy to become proficient at. And with many teachers setting deadlines and giving extensions, students can lose responsibility without trial and error. A psychological study that followed five students' grades and work style throughout four years portrayed the effect that self-led projects had on students before they left for college. Teenagers who had no control over their learning, while seemingly successful with their grades, lacked development on the section of the brain that controls creativity and responsibility. However, students who worked with their teachers on their course of study had better developed this section. These skills not only help students grow as self-thinkers, but as responsible and thoughtful human beings.\n \n In many ways, the future for today's children is unlike the life they live now in school. There will no longer be someone to give them instructions for every task, and many projects are completely controlled and monitored by the person creating it. School is designed to prepare students for the real world, yet many findÂ themselves lost by the time they must complete their own study or presentation in college. While it may be difficult to recreate these circumstances in high school, a summer project gives students 2 time to thoroughlyÂ researchÂ and involve themselves in their project. One may find themselves discovering new topics that they were not previously aware of. Whereas without the freedom to follow their own direction, they would become trapped with the same topic and format as everyone else.\n \n Free thinking is an important skill to have once you're an adult, and student-designed projects support the formation of this skill. The opportunity to express themselves through their learning is essential to the development of useful, creative habits that can be extremely helpful for the future of the world.",

      "Summer break is that time of the year where most students look forward to. Many are eager to sit back and relax, or enjoy their time with friends and family. Whatever it is, school is the last thing on their mind. It's the last thing on my mind too. Although that isn't always the case, there is always that one teacher that assigns projects over break. Summer projects are required through some schools to preserve their learning onto the next year. To make it more enjoyable, I believe that these summer projects should at least be student-designed for various reasons.\n \n Summer break is the time where most students proceed to pursue hobbies, enjoy lifes moments, spend time with people that are cared about, and make memorial memories. Over break, students tend to discover their true passions and focus on what drives their interest. With projects being assigned, that can be tough and build a wedge between the situation. If summer projects were to be student-designed however, students can make it more personalized and just have fun with it. I believe making the summer projects more personalized to students, can really ease the stress and make it more enjoyable. Overall, it is summer break. As a student myself, a time where this applied to me was in the summer of my freshman year. My teacher had assigned a summer project where we had to determine the area of different shapes in any form. Art is a huge passion of mine and I wanted to engage more of it into my summer. I decided to paint an abstract painting with a variety of shapes; circles, triangles, squares, you name it. It turned out beautiful, I really enjoyed spending my time on something that was educating and delightful. Engaging learning with enjoyable hobbies can be beneficial for the teachers' satisfactory and the students.\n \n For most people, finding hobbies that are interesting can be challenging. Knowing myself, I need a sense of direction to know what my interests. It takes a bit of courage to try something new and actually enjoy it. Student designed school projects can really help a student find his/her passions and learn something new along the way. An example of this is Generic_Name. When Generic_Name was younger, she stayed in a hostel and went to an all girls catholic school. Although the classes were given to her and the staff controlled her schedule, she found a way to have a passion for computers. Her summer assignment was to find am interest to occupy her for the upcoming summer. She began to observe her fathers work and grew an interest for how computers work. Today, she works in the computer coding world and enjoys every second of it. With enough interest, there is always something new just waiting to be discovered, who knows maybe you'll learn something new on the way. Student designed school projects can help one into discovering a new passion.\n \n Although students might think making school projects student-designed is a good idea, teachers might not agree. Some students could take this their advantage, by making the project as simple and pointless as they want. This could necessarily not reach the teachers standards and question if the student even learned anything at all. Although this could be case, summer projects are indeed just summer projects and shouldÂ not be taken seriously. Summer should be the time where students can have the choice of doing what they want. If projects are mandatory for teachers, then it can be arranged, but it shouldn't put unnecessary stress on students. Especially during summer break. Teachers should observe how well the student comes up with ideas and how well they execute their projects, it's more exciting that way.\n \n Having being said, student designed projects are better for both the student and the teacher. It allows students to have more freedom and personalize their studies with their occupation. Teachers will also have the chance to determine the students personality and see what the student is like. It shows how bright a student's mind can be and how well their work ethics are. Teachers should give students a chance to show off themselves and appreciate for what they are able to achieve in. It can also be a fun learning experience for many. Not only will these student-designed projects continue their learning throughout break, it will also preserve any sort of creativity a student could withhold.Â  Â Â Â Â",

      "Summer break, a time for both students and teachers to get a few months away from the not so wonderful place we call school. While most schools allow students a complete break from doing work there are some who still want to continue the learning experience during those months off. These schools require students to do a summer project to ensure they continue learning and don't completely shut off their brains. The question retaining to this topic is, should these projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? My stance on this is, the projects should be student-designed being that this is their break from school and they are still being required to complete a project.\n \n Students need the freedom to choose what they want the project to be about. Even during the school year most projects are teacher-designed, the teacher always has things set up how they want it and all the projects end up looking the same. I personally don't know how many students would complete a full project over the summer anyway, but if they are allowed to design it and set it up themselves I think they will be more excited to complete the task. Students also deserve this freedom, I feel like so many times teachers restrict things or make things more complicated by giving the students no freedom. Also, by allowing students the freedom to design their projects many students will show more respect for their teachers in the future and be more likely to work harder on other other things they are required to do.\n \n Whether students choose to show it in the work they turn in to their teachers, they are all so highly creative. I feel that most students don't tend to show how creative they are because they don't like the assignment they are given or feel like the guidelines are too strict to fully express themselves. I think it's important for teachers to know what their students are capable of and see that they can really bring their best work forward when they allow students to have more control of a project. Creativity is a really great way to understand someone, if teachers allow the students to be creative then they will start putting more of themselves into the projects and teachers can really start to see what wonderful minds they all have. Students need to be able to express themselves in creative ways and one of those ways is by allowing them to design their own project.\n \n My final point I'm going to make is that even though some schools may want to continue the learning experience during the summer it is still the students summer break. The thing most students look forward to from day one of school is summer break and a good majority of those students definitely don't want to have to complete a school related project when they are away from school. But if it's a requirement then allow the the students to choose what their projects will be about. Most teachers don't do work over the summer cause that's their break as well so if students must be forced to complete a task then let them be in charge so they aren't completely miserable their whole summer.\n \n In conclusion, the required summer project that students have to complete should be student-designed. These students work hard for almost ten months and deserve a break without hard, restricted work their teachers assign. But, if it is a requirement they deserve to be in charge of it. They need to be allowed the freedom to create these projects as they see fit. Students are wonderful, creative people and need to be allowed to express themselves thoroughly so that teachers can see what theyÂ are capable of when they let them take the reigns and let their creative magic happen. After all summer break is supposed to be a time for them to relax and forget about school for awhile and they most certainly don't want a complicated project to work on so, I say, the students need to be able to design their own projects for sake of letting them enjoy their summer break.",

      'Teachers can justify students knowledge more accurately than students. Teachers are very experienced compare to the students because they gained so much knowledge in their life. By doing the teacher designed projects, students can learn something that they did notÂ know about. Teachers would know what topics they really need to focus on and what are the most important things they need to know about. Students summer projects should be designed by their teachers to make sure that they are being 3, hardworking andÂ responsible for their work during the break.\n \n Summer projects of the students should be designed by their teachers to make sure that the students are being 3 during the summer break. Teachers know the academic ability of their student because they know how the students answers some specific types of questions, they know how the students think and understand. For Example, In my fifth grade there was a math teacher named Generic_Name. Ms. Generic_Name and I spent so much time with each other to discuss my mistakes on a test, She asked me do to test corrections on a paper. I solved all the questions correctly without a time limit, She came to me and said, "I knew you could do it, because I have seen you working very hard these days". Then, I realized that I knew how to solve these problems but I was scaredÂ to complete the test before the timer goes off becauseÂ I did not know I could complete everything. This examples describes that the teachers know our academic ups and downs than ourselves. They also know what we need to learn to succeed in our class, So when they design a project to their students they make sure that the students are going to be 3 on their break and learning something new which will help them in their future.\n \n Summer projects of the students should be teacher-designed to make sure that the students are hardworking even during the summer break. Teachers know the capacity of hard work we do in our class, they observe the amount of effort that we put into different things like talking, reading, writing and singing, etc. For example, one of my teacher in 10th grade was really nice to me, she always used to ask me about my hobbies and interests. I had a presentation in her class and I went to ask her for help the day before the presentation because I was preparing for almost a month, I wanted to ask her if I did any mistakesÂ in the slides. After I showed her my slides, she gave me a big hug an said "I know how hard you worked for this presentation, I gave you a hard project to see is you are capable to do it or not. Even thoughÂ you came to United States two months ago, you did a fantastic job". I was very happy to hear her saying that I did good and on the day of my presentation I felt really confident on my work. This example explains how the teacher knew that I worked so hard to do my best. By assigning me a hard project based on my level of understanding, I worked hard to understand and analyze every single detail. That helped me to gain confidence on my self and my level of hard work improved a lot. When teachers design the project they make sure that the students are trying to work hard and they want to see how your working level is improving.\n \n Summer projects of the students should be designed by their teachers to make sure that the students are being responsible for their work during the summer break. when teachers design the project they know how long it is going to take the students to complete the project and how well focusedÂ and responsible a student need to be while doing this project. For example, My history teacher in 10 grade was very strict, she always wanted our whole class to turn in everything that she posted online in one day. After 2-3 months of struggling in her class, everything was going really good till the last day of that academic year. All of my work was completed on time. This example says that even though I worked really hard in the beginning, when it came to the end of the yearÂ I was really happy for being responsible for my own work. By learning how to be responsible from that teacher, helped me a lot in all of my other classes too. Summer projects given by our teachers can make us feel responsible for ourselves, by doing the projectsÂ teach us how to be focused and concentrated to get them done on time. when the students design the project they take it easy becauseÂ most of the students just pick something they already know or they already feel confident on, which will not make them feel responsible.\n \n Teachers are very experienced to know how students think about something, they can understand what students know and what we do not know academically. They always try to teach us how to build our academic skills. They want the students to be in an amazing position, they always want to see the best from us because they know how the student are. Summer projects of the students should be teacher designed to make sure that they are being 3, hardworking andÂ responsible for their work during the break.Â',

      "Generic_Name is given a summer project by her teacher and is annoyed over having to do work over the summer, but once she actually starts the project she realizes it helps her remember material and comes to school feeling more prepared. A teacher gives students a project to do over the summer knowing exactly what the students need in order to continue learning and become prepared for the coming school year. Although receiving work to do over the summer for students may be bothersome, teachers understand the requirements students should meet in order to learn efficiently throughout the summer so that they will not forget important material. Teachers should be designing the summer projects rather than students themselves because they understand what material is needed to learn, they have a broader outlook on what all students can do, and they will provide a more challenging project.\n \n Although a student may argue that students should be the ones designing the summer projects because as a student, students will know what will be good for other students. Being the same age group may help in developing a project that will help other students learn over the summer but consequently that is not the case. Students are all different when it comes to learning techniques and when coming up with a project, it may either be difficult or too easy for other classmates. Work provided by students will vary in results and become unreliable. Teachers know what is needed to learn and therefore give students a summer projects that will be efficient enough to help students during the summer.\n \n In order to be prepared for the coming school year, students will need know what material is necessary to remember. Teachers know exactly what material be taught and need to make sure students do not forget basic information. When coming up with a project for students a English teacher will know which basic information is needed to remember, such as knowing basic vocabulary terms to distinguish while reading, Students will easily forget terms and struggle when coming back to school and needing to restudy these basic terms, it also takes away more time for teachers to teach. Teachers are the ones teaching the material and understand the necessitiesÂ students are gonna need to remember for the upcoming year.\n \n With that, to make sure students actually do learn, it is necessary that students are given a project that will be helpful for the majority. Teachers have the broader outlook on what exactly the majority of students should be learning and will help students learn over the summer that way they will feel more prepared for the coming school year. Teachers will ensure that by looking through test averages, seeing where students did worst and best at and reflect that on the summer project. By looking through what students did best and worst at teacher will provide a helpful project for the summer to make sure students learn in the summer. Students will have the lower hand in this situation because of lack of knowledge towards what other classmates did well and bad on.\n \n Summer projects will only help students learn if the project actually requires students to think and work efficiently. Teachers will be sure students are given a project they cannot just wing and do quickly. Teachers could give essays or book reports that way students will actually be more hands on and not lack off doing the summer projects. Giving students a more challenging or thinking based summer project will not only prevent laziness but will make the students feel more productive with their summer. The boost of productivity will give more confidence to the students as in something that could be too easy to quickly finish. Teachers understand that more thinking based work or more work will help students learn more efficiently and be more productive. Giving them a simple project or a project that involves little work will only increase the chances of students lacking off and therefore result in nothing being learned.\n \n In conclusion, summer projects are given to students so that they continue to learn in the summer and become more prepared for the coming school year. Whether or not these summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed, it is easier to say they should be teacher-designed. Teachers understand the material and the students and therefore will provide a more efficient summer project. When being able to understand what is required for a summer project, teachers will have the better understanding on ensuring the project will be efficient for students to learn.Â",

      "How would a student feel if they had to endure a lesson during the summer by a immature kid? Summer assignments have been implicated in student's daily lives since 7th grade. The theory is that if teachers provide students with a summer assignment, they will be ready for the classroom in the fall. However, there is a rise in the education department where they have to see if it is really benifical for the younger generation to have their assignments designed by a teacher or a student. The pratical answer for this discussion would be to have a teacher-designed summer assignment because it will prepare the students for their class, strengthn their abilities, and open their eyes to what the future would look like going into higher education.\n \n Learning the material by someone who is already trained in this profession will help prepare the students for the year since the teacher is the one who is going to help them get a wide range of education. It will be more benifical if the students learn this way because its going to get them ready for the year. For example, if a math teacher gives a student a summer project that they designed they will already have a planned idea of what is going to be in the next school year. This will let the young adults see what they will be doing in the following school year which in turn can help the student understand if this class is the right clas for them.\n \n Not to mention, if the summer assignments were teacher-designed it will give the students the oppurtunity to learn more about their strengths and weaknesses. In the school system more than 85% of the school's population have struggled in one or two subjects. Moreover, that means students will have a harder time grasping certain subjects when the school year begins. If the assignments where created by the teacher then they will have an easier time at the beginning of the year to understand what the student is struggling with. Moreover, it could also help the student by getting the student to think more about what they struggle with and how they can grow upon it since it is an independent project.\n \n However, since it is a summer assignment, students would not be as motivated to do the work since it is an extended amount of time ot do a minimal activity. As teens go into summer they do not worry about the summer assignment and get this feeling of procrastination with the certain activity. 95% of teens around the world struggle with this thought and wait until the last minute. Which could be damaging to the students education.\n \n Since procrastionation occurs it would be more likely for students to cheat. However, making the assignment teacher designed and giving it time stamps of when it is due during the summer will force students to deal with time managment. Moreover, if we allow our children to be interactive with teacher-designed assignments, then they will be more prepared for the future. For example, if an english teacher decides to make a summer assignment and put certain due dates during the summer rather then giving them a student-designed activity; It will give the student a chance to learn about what it means to have responsibilities. Which is important because it will make sure that students can be independent with their jobs.\n \n The debate on whether or not summer assignments should be designed by a certain person has shown the community what really is important in this society. Our educators wanna make sure that the students will be prepared for what is coming to them, especially if they are taking an AP course. Moreover, it will shine light to some of the weaknesses in a student early on so the educator can help them with this skill. Likewise, it can also make the young adults open to ideas of having important responsiblities so they will be ready for the workforce. No matter what occurs in life, educators should make sure that they are guiding the new generation to a bright and happy future.Â",

      "Summer projects have become a cultural norm within the school system. These projects have been created and mandated by the teachers. It can be vigorous and also very flexible depending on the teachers idea of what they believe you should do. Summer projects should be student designed because it allows kidsÂ to have more freedom, it keeps the students interested in their project, and allows for more flexibility within their project.\n \n Summer projects should be student designed because it allows kids to have more freedom.Â Generic_Name, a student at Generic_School, completes vigorous sports and extra curricular activities during summer and, also has 5 different classes with summer assignments. Generic_Name has designed a workload that he can complete while leaving free time but, his teachers have designed summer projects that completely wipe out all his free time. Generic_Name should be able to design a summer project that works for his schedule and, should not be told by his teachers what to do on his only long term break from those teachers. Another student, named Generic_Name, wishes to be engaged during her time off but does not want the burden of having her summer break destroyed by teachers who try to maximize their workload during the time off. She wants to be able to create a project that minimizes her time learning but that keeps her engaged during the break so that she is ready to come back. By mandating what students do outside of school limits their freedom during a time where they should be on a break from school; This totally destroys the whole idea of summer being a break and a time to de-stress by constantly stressing students to finish summer projects. Students want freedom during the summer, this is why projects should be student designed.\n \n Also, summer projects should be student designed because it keeps the students interested in their project. A 12th grade student, named Generic_Name, is being told by his teacher that he must read the book, the odyssey, during his summer break but, Generic_Name has no interest in that book what so ever. Students should have the ability to chose which book they read, if any. If a teacher tells a student they must read a novel over summer, they can choose a book that interests them so it makes it easier and, ultimately more fun for the student. A 9th grader, named Generic_Name is required to complete an 100 question math summer packet during her time off. She has AD/HD and struggles to stay focused for long periods of time, especially in things that do not interest her. By allowing her to complete online practice using a math app, it will keep her engaged and will allow her to make sure she is doing these problems correctly. Teachers mandating what students do and how they do it may interest the teacher but, a majority of the time, will bore the student and can actually lead to a regression in their skills. If students can design their own summer project that keeps them interested, it ultimately leads to more participation and 3ness among students.\n \n Furthermore, Summer projects should be student designed because it allows for more flexibility within their project. For example, Generic_Name, a student athlete, plays on one of the highest rankedÂ women'sÂ lacrosse teams in the country, she has practice and workouts during the weekdays and aÂ tournamentÂ every single weekend.Â Generic_Name was assigned a 400 page book to read but can never find the time nor the energy to read that much. By allowing her to chose, for example, an 150 page book, she can find enough time and energy to stay focused, and be able to complete the book. If students are not allowed the ability to design their projects it tends to become more of a pain to the student, rather than help. It tends to stress students more, especially those with vigorous schedules, during a time created for students to take a break. An 11th grade Spanish teacher, Generic_Name, sends out a summer assignment that requires students to go out and use Spanish in the real world. What would be considered to most students as an easy task, some students are not comfortable with this and would rather do book workÂ at home where they feel more comfortable. A one size fits all plan does not work for every student, some need hands on learning, some need to listen to instruction and be taught directly to, and some students need to read and do book work. The idea that one assignment will fit every students needs and allow them to complete it quickly and efficiently will quite frankly never work. This type of flexibility is what students need out of summer projects and, they should be designed by the students.\n \n Summer projects should be student designed because it allows kidsÂ to have more freedom, it keeps the students interested in their project, and allows for more flexibility within their project. Every student is a different learner with different advantages and disadvantages and, projects should be made to meet those students needs or they will either not complete it, or complete it while gaining nothing from it. Students know what they need and should not be completely controlled by teachers who think they know whats best for them. The student knows themselves better than anyone else in the world so they should be able to design their own summer projects.Â  Â",

The summer projects should be designed by the teachers because teachers have it planned, teachers know the information needed on the project , and it gives the students a less work lode over their break.\n \n First thing is, teachers would have the projects all planned out for their students, so the student won't have to worry to plan a project out. It gives a teacher a relief knowing that their student has a project ready for them, and not having to worry that the student for the them to make one. It is also important for the teacher to have it planned because they would have all the work needed on the project.\n \n When the teachers plans it out it would be more organized. It is also better for the teacher to have it planned; because they can see where the students need help when they have completed the project.\n \n Teachers would know what information is needed to help the student learn ,and get them ready for the upcoming year. When the teacher has all the work needed on the project; the student wont have to worry and look upÂ what they need to study. This is important because it gives the teachers the information to see what their students are struggling in ,and plan ahead for the year. When the information is laid out for the student it would be more: organized to do their work, more efficient, and gives them a heads up to see what their struggling in. This will also be easier on the teacher when they have the project ready for the students because it gives them an idea how to gradeÂ the project.\n \n The summer projects would be best if the teachers design them. Thats because when students are on break; they would get to lazy and not even want to start making a project for school. Also the student might even forget to design it on their own. Thats why when the teacher has it already designed; they can email their students, and remind them to work on the project that is already made for them. Another reason why the teacher should design the projects is, it gives the students time to be kids and have fun. Also it gives the students more time to enjoy their break with their family and friends. Over all it would give the student lees of a work lode over the break and let them be kids and enjoy.\n \n Although students should be able to design their own projects because they can study and do the parts they need to learn more; other then having to do work that they already know, but teachers insures that all the students have the needed work and information that the students need to learn. Also the teachers would have all the information if the student forgets to include in their project.

      "Many students tend to forget or struggle when their teachers assign them with projects over the summer.Â Students should design their own projects because teachers don't know what students do over the summer and students want to have fun and want to enjoy it more than having to still do school work. This lets students create a project that will allow them to manage how much time they can set into doing school work and have more time enjoying their break. Letting students choose helps them by setting it at a level that they can work at without struggle and make it easier for them.\n \n Students creating a student-designed project will allow them to manage time better with what they can work on during the summer and have more time enjoying their break. Most students like to travel over the break and sometimes they can't do it abroad and don't have much time when they come back. For example: \"I went to El Salvador with my father and he lives in the country side, in his house he doesn't have wifi but does have cable. Coming back I only had five days to do it before I had to go back to middle school.\" Students wouldn't be able to do any school work because they could probably not have internet access and want to enjoy their time visiting.\n \n Students can design their project and making it easier by doing: a summary over a couple of simple novels, do a short essay over a easy and simple prompt, do research over patterns in nature like, looking at moon patterns for two weeks or observe temperatures for a period amount of time and do a study on it when they come back. For example: \" I had a simple project to recorded what the moon looked like at night, every night for a week and draw it. This was easy and simple for me to do and i still learned a lot from it from observing that the moon slowly phases through each night through its cycle.\" Even doing small simple projects, students can still learn and discover new things because they don't have to stress about it and its something most students should be able to do.\n \n Someone might say, Teachers select projects that they think is good for students and it's better for a teacher to have control over it because they know their students best, expects them to do their best, accomplish it and that challenging them is good so they don't forget what they learned; however, that's not the case, really what teachers don't know sometimes, and what makes students have a hard time or take a long time on projects is that, teachers want to assign projects to what they think their students can do and put them at a challenging level or a process that takes a long time but students want to have it simple over the summer has they don't have class with other students and don't meet their teachers anymore so they can't ask for help. Students don't need to stress out over the summer by what their teachers assign, letting students decide lets them be creative and discover with what they chose to do.\n \n In conclusion, Student-designed projects, will encourage and help students with work and still learn from it as the teacher wanted for them to learn in the students own creative way.",

      "Some schools require summer projects for students; these projects need to be student designed. When teachers plan a project some students don't enjoy completing the assigned task. For students to learn they have to be interested in what they are doing. There are many ways to assign a school project, it could be hands on, writing, individually, in groups etc. Each student has different skills, they should do a project that best fits that skill to succeed. Summer projects need to be student designed so that they are more motivated to complete the assignment, to have fun with the assignment and to have interest in the task.\n \n Summer projects need to be student designed to enhance motivation. When students are motivated this encodes the topic in their memory. When students are motivated they get better grades, the project is better quality and students do the project to their best ability. As a student when a project gets assigned and I am not interested in the assignment I try to get it done as quickly as possible and put no effort into it. I end up getting a lower grade. Students will also want to keep working on the project if they are motivated to complete it. With more time spent on the project this equals better quality and higher grades. Students won't procrastinate if the project interests them and will be motivated to start the project early. As a student in High School lots of students procrastinate when given a project. If projects were student designed this would motivate them to learn about the topic.\n \n Summer projects need to be student designed so that they have fun with it. If they had fun with the assignment then they would have a memory of their experience. If schools made learning fun they are more likely to remember the topic of the project. If students were in a group for the project this would enhance team work skills if they had fun. As a student I found out that if I had fun learning about a certain topic I remember it more clearly and can connect it to other things in life.\n \n Summer projects need to be student designed to have students have interest in the topic. This would help students explore their interests that they never knew they were interested in. This may help students what they want to do after graduation. Chances are if a student is really interested in what they learned in class then they might explore that topic outside of school. When I had a project assigned to me that I was interested in I enjoyed completing the project and continued to learn more about it outside of school. Summer projects that have students interested is a key to success in their academic career.\n \n In conclusion, summer projects need to be student designed so that they look forward to working on the assignment, enjoy completing the task and continue learning about the topic outside of school. Some people say that projects should be teacher designed they are wrong because students then dont get the freedom of doing what they enjoy most. It also isn't equal to all students. For example, a teacher assigns a research paper on a certain topic, some students have a love for writing and it is their strength and others don't like to write. This is why student designed projects are important.Â",

While teachers have tried to find ways of captivating students by giving a varietyÂ of choices or making it more hands on, they always miss the real reason why students seems to loathe these assignments. I believe that it all comes down to student choice. Society teaches us that we are all different in our own ways and that people want to do different things, but this is not demonstratedÂ in our schools. A step forward into integrating more individual-focused work is by starting off with one of the most hated assignments for all children, summer projects. Having student-designed projects would give students the chance to explore topics they're interested in, control over how they want they're project to turn out, and incentives creative thinking.\n \n The most common response I get from my peers when we get a project over the summer is, \"Why would I need to know about this?\". This leads to them not caring about the outcome of their assignment and putting minimal effort into it, thus leading to lackluster scores. This could be absolved by letting them choose what they want to learn more about. Seeing that it is the summertime, I believe that students shouldn't be tied down to one subject, but use their break to learn whatever they feel that they need to put more time into. Even if it has to revolve around one subject, they should have the option to include aspects of other subjects that they would find more enjoyable. Giving them the option to choose where they want their time to be spent would open up different avenues for them to take their learning.\n \n Students want more control over how they want their work to turn out. Giving strict restraints on how the project should be about and its formattingÂ disincentives students who work at a slower pace and holds back those who work faster. Rather than molding the student to fit into the curriculum, make the curriculum easier to mold. Give students the best opportunity to grow and succeed rather than holding them to a set standard that all can't meet. We all have different preferences and learning levels and our work should reflect those differences.\n \n Letting them design their own projects would challenge them to think creatively. With the option to take aspects of multiple subjects and to illustrate it in a precise manner, you would have to think of creative ways to present it. This would force students to think carefully about what information they want to include and the undertones that it could have, just like in real world presentations.Â With the choices that would be given to them, students would have to find the right combinationÂ of formats and subjects that would most accuratelyÂ reflects their goal.\n \n While some would say that it could lead to students choosing the easiest route, I believe this comes from a place of little faith. Given the chance to learn more about something that actually interests them, I think that most students would jump on the chance. The reason why students, especially high school students, seem so apathetic is that we aren't interested. We feel as if we're just going through the motions of school and that summer projects are just a way to bleed more of our time away. The problem isn't the student, but how the system is set in place.\n \n Summer projects have always been a chore to do. From the uninteresting topics, to the fact that it's during the summer has always made students dread, but if these projects were designed by the students, I think we would see a sharp spike in enthusiasm around their arrival. Being able to choose the topic, have control over how it turns out, and the need to actually think creatively would excite students and teachers alike. Giving us the chance to express ourselves would be the right direction for summer projects.",

      "Imagin if all summer projects were only designed by teaches. It would be no fun. Students should be able to chose whatevery they want to reaserch and make a project out of it. While some would prefer a teacher designed project, student designed projects lets students chose their own topic, experiment the way they want, and present it the way they want.\n \n Student designed projects lets students chose any topic they want. I love it when I get to chose my own project because I can research any of my desired intrests. Chosing my own topic also motivates me to get the project done; for that, I am a curious person. Any project should let students chose their own topic.\n \n Students should experiment any way they want. When I was a freshman in highschool my science teacher let experiment any way we wanted; I built a solar panal that followed the sun. That project let me have lots of fun and made me be crative. Student designed projects lets students expeiment in thier own way and have fun when their doing it.\n \n Presentations should be apeling and informative to the reader. When I design a project I like to make the project the most crative and informative. Most teaches just say to make a power point or an essay, but that doesn't show any crativity. Student designed projects lets students present how they want to present and let them be as crative as thay want.\n \n Some might like teacher designed projects because students do not have to think of a project; however, student designed projects let students chose thier topic, experiment however way they want, and present the way they want. Summer project should be fun and crative because it is student's break from school. Most student projects are fun, crative, and gives students freedom.",

      "AlthoughÂ many teachers designing their own summer projects for the students, the students should be designingÂ their own summer projects. Students they chose their own topic and design their own project willÂ be more interested in what they are learning. Also the students would be more likely to actually do the project if it is something they have interest in, and the students would have more say in what they are learning if they got to design their own summer project.\n \n If students were allowed to design their own project they would be a lotÂ more likely to actually do the project. Most students rather be with friends or on vacation during summer, rather then staying inside and working on a paper for school in two months. If the student designed the project it would be something that they might actually want to do or find interesting, not just something they were told they had to do the last day of school for that year. I know when I'm on vacation I like to do what I want to do and not be followed around by all the school I have to get done. So if it feels less like school work and more like a project that you want to do in your free time the students might actually do it.\n \n Letting the student have a say in the design of their project helps them get more involved with their learning and education. If you just et a teacher tell them what to do they will get bored with learning and not be interested and learning new things, but if they got a say in them project they could get involved and actually enjoy learning. I know from my life experiences I hadÂ a lotÂ more fun learning when I had a say in what I got to learn, such as me joining the Fire Department. When I joined it was a lotÂ of self assigning tasks and learning on your own time and at your own pace. When I got the chance to work with the people that where teaching me and have a say in what I learned and when I got a lot more into what I was learning and applied myself a lot more then I usually do in school.\n \n A student is way ore likely to do a project that actually interests him or her. A teacher can just pick a random topic without even thinking if the students will find it interesting. If the student is not interestedÂ in the topic it just makes it that much harder for them to pay attention and stay focused on the topic. When you are forced to learn about something that doesn'tÂ interest you it is harder to learn that topic. You have to do it all the time in schools such SOL's. You learn about something in school that does not interest you so the state will give you a label of smart or not smart even if you are just not interested in the random topics they pick to say they have taught you something. If it is a project that is to be done over summer vacation, let it be something that the student might actually enjoy and want to do. The student can easily just blow of the project and then start the next year in a bad spot because he or she is already behind on the first day of school and that is setting them up for failure for the rest of the year.\n \n Although teachers liking to design their summer projects for the students, the students should design their summer project. Have the project follows certain guide lines so it is still some what attached to what the students learned in school. Having the students get involved with their education is good for a lot more than just school, it can help them in the real world too. Students would learn more about something that might interest them if the student designsÂ their own project.Â",

    essay:
      "Over the summer, the majority of students will forget the core lessons they learned; therefore, some teachers decide to give students summer projects to keep information fresh in their minds. There is an ongoing debate over whether teachers should choose the summer projects for students, or if the assignment should be the ideas of the student themselves. There are those that say that it would be better for teachers to assign their own project, but this is not true. Although some may disagree, students should design their own summer projects.\n \n There are a variety of reason why students should create their own summer project. First and foremost, it inspires creativity. When a teacher assigns their own cut-and-paste project, this removes most creativity from the assignment. Students need to practice creative skills, and the low stress environment of summer is a perfect time for doing that. Additionally, students having their own project idea allows them to do what they want to do. This is obviously beneficial because the student can choose the subject that they are best at, which will improve the quality of the summer project. Also, giving the student the choice on what they want to do makes the project enjoyable, which is important considering that it is summer break. Finally, allowing students to assign their own project ideas motivates the student to actually do it. It is very common to witness teachers giving direct instructions on how the class should do something in a certain way, only for the students to lose interest. On the other hand, giving students their own unique project can inspire them to complete it with actual effort.\n \n There are additional reason why students should create their own summer projects. For instance, the student can use real world examples that they are familiar and can easily understand. Most teachers, especially ones in larger schools, will not know the student's personal interests and experience very well. Students can take inspiration, data, and ideas from their surroundings during the summer, which can make for an excellent project. Another reason students should design their own summer projects is that it creates less stress for the teacher. If students are making their own projects, it will make the job of teachers easier since they dont have to create unique prompts for each student. Additionally, each student having their own personally crafted project will get rid of the possibility of cheating, something they have would have if students were all to have the same assignment. Lastly, students creating their own summer projects will prepare them for the future. In college, many assignments given by your professor will be self directed, meaning you will need practice in creating your own ideas for projects. Careers also rely on creativity, innovations need to be made for more efficient work, which can earn you promotions.\n \n Although some may disagree, students should design their own summer projects. This is the case due to less overall stress, motivation for students, and inspiration for creativity and innovation. There are those that say teachers should design the project for the student because the teacher knows what the student needs to learn, what the school board wants, and what the student will learn the following year, but this is not the case. It's true teachers need to encourage creativity in and outside the classroom, but students also should enjoy their summer break after a hard school year.Â",

      "Summer assignments are important to help students continue learning over the summer. This is why these assignments should be designed by teachers, rather than students. This is due to the fact that teachers are going to assign challenging projects, which most students would not; additionally, teachers may use this assignment as a way to prepare the students for the following year.\n \n Everyone wants to enjoy their summer break, go on vacations, and chill at the beach. Summer assignments are a great way to put a pause on the fun. Knowing this, students are not going to purposefully give themselves a challenging project that could benefit them in the long run. They would create assignments requiring the least amount of effort and time in order to get back to playing videogames or tanning on the beach. This defeats the purpose of the summer assignment because an easy project that does not challenge you will not continue your learning throughout the summer.\n \n Additionally, this may be a great opportunity for teachers to help prepare students for the type of assignments they will be recieving the following school year. Students are unaware of what to expect, so they cannot prepare themselves 2ly. Teachers have also been with these same students all year and know what they are good at, and what they need to work on. Assigning them a summer project may help these students work on their weak points, and gives them plenty of time to improve before the next school year.\n \n Some may argue that if students are not actively trying to challenge themselves, then they are only hurting themselves. However, many students likely are not sure what type of project would benefit them best, or are unaware of what they need to work on to improve. They also likely assume that they do not need to be challenged or believe that they are already prepared for the next school year.\n \n Overall, students would benefit more from teacher-designed summer assignments. Teachers know what students need to be prepared for and where their weak spots are. Often times students are unaware of how to help themselves improve. This last assignment can lead students in the right direction and assure that they are fully prepared for the following school year.",

      "The school system says we as students should all do some type of school related work during the summer in order to still have the knowledge of the things we learned during the time we was in school. including school projects, I do beleive that the school assignments that are givien should be student designed because in fact they are giving the work to us. The teachers already gives us alot of assgiments that are dessigned by teachers and their department maybe for once its time to give us a chance to let the projects be on us and up to our knowledge , even though the summer is really suppose to be about our summer vacation because we did just come from school and finished our requirements, the summer is really just a break for student to relax and getting your mind off school but I do agree that we should still do work and try to at least read once in a while so we dont go back to school during end of August or Septmeber and we clueless, reasons of why the summer projects should be student designed is because students may have ideas that teacher dont think about giving and belelive it or not these students can be very creative sometimes and come up with really excting ideas for projects with that being said they should be school educational wise , with the purpose of the summer projects being designed by students it's a better way of showing the teachers and the school education department that we have been learning in school what we need to know for an example when a student is doing their assignment and they include , context clue , details , strong vocabulary words and the unit basis of what we have learned in school. Coming to the next grade level it will show teachers that so far we have learned the right curriculum and the reached the standards because it will be presented in that presentation or that project assignment by the students who are doing it on their summer vacation however , if it were to be teacher designed because teachers are looking for specific portions of what they have learned during out the school year and on books they have read then I would understand why it would be that way even thought its taking out the purpose of a students own ability to do work on what they want to work on like me being in that position I would absolute take student designing the summmer projects for an answer.\n \n I would brianstorm with all my ideas for example ; the way i used math this summer when i went out and helped my father at his job because his back was injured i can definetly write out how i used some math learining skills and I can also write out the trips i went to and wrote essays about how it went and the stops we made thats a skill of writing and perhaps even reading , the more vacations and trips the longer my essays can be , of course it has to be educational wise so i will add some puncuations and maybe even the vocabulary that i learned during english class , it will show that not only do i remember what i was doing in school but I will also be preparing myself for next year I will have more practice and knowledge and try to fit in a litte bit of history in there as well like what's going on with my family and the government and how my grandma is sick so we trying to bring her here to stay with us for a while but because of the new rules in the United States , there's just some things we aren't allowed to accomplish no matter how bad we want her here and take care of her , I can definently make a project in how the government has these new rules that affects others and their familes like mine , that would be a example of me being in the postion as to it being student designed so I can personally write about how my life is going with that being said I would have to make the projects relate to school and the things we learned and of course that can be easy because there's alot of things we learn in school that can help us out later in life and when we look at a situation we see the things we been taught to prepare us in becoming adults I still til this day come home telling my parents something new that I've learned and at least try to help like when my mother lost her job and I was sitting in econ and finance and listening to my teacher tell us the things we can come off of when your in a situation like my mother when she was fired and was on a contract but because the business was low my mom was took out , teachers teach you alot about life and how you want to be ready and some students take it as a joke and others think into it and see a lot of sitiations like it when they come home and their parents having their own problems those are things we learn in school and when we have a chance to decide on our ideas. I think it's best as coming up with good thoughts on how around the places you travel or even in your own household there is school knowledge.\n \n things we learn in school students can relate to and may or may not affect them at home . When we're out of school we go home and have a long summer break and as we start to think of the things we've been taught in school we living in it and that's our future , that being said I do think students should be giving the opportuinty to decide on what they want to present there project on in the condtions of it being school educational purposes and to show how they not forgetting what students learning in school. A project in the summer especially when it's our free time, our vacation, it's time to let us students show the teachers what we know and learned from them and how we can relate to it when we are actually living in it, when we learn in school we have all this knowlege and the standards in each subject we're being taught gettting us ready when we become adults ourself. letting it be teacher-designed will only cover what a teacher expects from us. Us as students have way more to show what we know and what we keep in with us as we are being taught different lessons in each subject.",

      "Many teachers assign summer projects to students to ensure that the child is still school focused throughout all the fun summer activities. Even though, majority of students hate the words \"summer and project\" together, giving them lead way to design their project is the best way to go. Students would have a chance to gain responsibility, be creative and make an easy grade.\n \n Firstly, giving students the lead way to design their project allows the individual to gain responsibility. The student would be obligated to make time for all the steps leading up to the final project, making them move their schedule around or cancel plans. This ties into being an adult, making sacrifices to get important things done. For example, a students gets a summer project, its a Friday night and his or her friends wants them to go out. Instead of being behind on the project from going out, simply saying no and staying in to miss out on the fun is a sacrifice to the student. Therefore, creating responsibility from the ultimatum.\n \n Secondly, letting students take lead way is the best option because it allows the student to actually be creative. Students get boring topics and assignments all the time, causing them to do poorly strictly because they dont find interest on the topic. However, giving students the free will design the project based on their interests while also being school related will definitely give a change in the result of the final project versus a random teacher designed project. For example, a teacher gives a random topic she designed to the student. The student gets a topic about plants, which the student knows nothing about while also having little to none interest about them. As a result, the student is not going to give their full potential on the project because they did not have interest on the forced topic.\n \n Lastly, letting students design their summer project will give students the ability to bring their grade up. By students being creative and going the extra mile to have a successful project will give them the the perfect opportunity to make a great grade. For example, while doing the summer project the students will have confidence in the topic. While doing research the student will know exactly what they want to look for and even have a small plan on how they'd like the final outcome of the project to be. Resulting in a confident, well putÂ together project.\n \n However, some teachers might argue that allowing the students to design their summer project wouldn't be an excellent idea. Teachers may say that students would give no effort because they do have lead way on their project or it may be overwhelming for the student to make a decision on what they wanted their topic to be. However, letting the student have the option to choose their topic would not allow the student to not give effort or any creativeness. The topic would only be designed by the student and what their personal skill level is, leaving them to set their own boundaries up based on what they prefer.\n \n In result, when summer rolls around and summer projects are assigned, letting students get the opportunity to design their project gives them responsibility by making simple or grand decisions, an open door to the students creative limits, and also makes great pay off from all the hard work and dedication gone into the project. So next time a teacher assigns a boring topic, students should take the lead and make a astonishing grade.",

      "Most schools require students to complete a summer project to make sure that students are still expanding their knowledge while school is closed. These summer projects are long, uninteresting, and tiring. Most students refuse to complete a summer project. Summer projects should be made into something that students would want to do and enjoy doing. Summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to be creative, students can pick an assignment that is best for their knowledge capability, and students become more intrigued with their assignment.\n \n Typically when summer projects are assigned from a teacher, they're similar assignments. When summer projects are similar, they attend to make all students the same and strips away any originality. Students need to be able to show their individuality through their work. Research shows that when students choose their assignments, they exceedÂ by forty-five percent more than a teacher-assigned assignment. Creativeness is something that should be essential to students because that it was forms them as a whole and makes them unique to themselves. Each summer project would allow students to express themselves in ways that a teacher-assigned summer project can't. Creativity is something that is with-in a person and something that should never be taken away from an individual.\n \n Students come in variety, from ethnicity, gender, age, and most importantly in this case, teaching perforations. Students will learn a lot better if they were allowed to pick their own assignments because they could create a summer project that is perfect for their learning pace. For example, I observed that when I am completing an assignment that is not too fast or not too slow for me, I do better tremendously. Summer projects are so horrific already, at the very least students should be able to decide what is best for their learning capacity. Pacing would set students up for great improvement and succession.\n \n Students will become more interested in their summer project. Most students will not complete or do well on something that they are not interested in. An article stated that, because students are so young, and their brain has not developed yet, their attention span is very short. Meaning that students will not focus on anything for a very long time, especially something that is boring and has no significance to them. Evidence also shows that each year the passing rate and or completion rate of summer projects never exceed or increase, the rates always decrease. Students will be intrigued with their work if its assigned by them. If teachers keep assigning summer projects then the passing rate of the summer projects will continue to decrease, students need to stay interested and the most important way to have that happen is to allow them to choose their own summer project assignment.\n \n Summer projects need to cater to students to cause improvement. Students do not require much to be successful,teachers just have to have the ability to allow their students to be flexible with their work. It is important that teachers grasp knowledge of how important it is that a student remains creative,that a student can pace themselves,that students remain intrigued, and most importantly students become successful with their summer projects. Summer projects are a wonderful idea but being student-assigned is way better.",

      "When school ends, and summer break begins, some schools require students to complete summer projects. These projects are to make sure students continue their education outside of school. When teachers design the projects, students are more challenged with the work they are given. However, a student-designed project is a much better choice; Students are more likely to do the work designed by them, students will have less of a hard time, and students will feel less stressed rather than having to do a more challenging project.\n \n A project designed by a teacher can be dreadful enough, let alone the fact that the project is over break. Student-designed projects are more likely to be completed due to the simple fact that the work would be more enjoyable for students. When a student gets work that they are able to enjoy, they will complete it. Most teachers do not give out work that a student could enjoy, they just give out boring work. Some students enjoy the work when there are more interactive activities within the project, and some students do not get much done when it is just the work itself.\n \n When students enjoy the work, that means they are not having a hard time understanding and completing what needs to be done. Students feel good and more confident in the work they do when they understand what they are doing. If a student has a hard time comprehending what is being taught, they tend to become indecisive and would choose to not turn their work in. Student can be nervous at times, like when they want to ask for help. Most students just try to either figure out work themselves or just not do the work. Making the projects student-designed can help students be more confident when it is on work they do not have a hard time on. Students work better on work they are confident on, and on work they know they are capable in doing.\n \n School can stress a lot of children out. Making them continue doing work can add on to their stress if it is something they feel incapable of doing. Giving students the choice of designing their project can give them the benefit of the doubt, because the project is still what the school wants but just at the rate of what the student can do. Stress should not be something a school wants their students to have.\n \n Summer break is the time for students to enjoy themselves. Students should at leastÂ have the choice on how their project is designed. All year the teachers had a say on what their work would consist of. The students should have a project they could enjoy doing, and not feel forced to do a project they would have a hard time on.

      "Have you ever wondered, why students stress themselves up during their summer vacations? Why sometimes they refuse to interact with people around them? Well, the reason of this issue is the \"teacher-designed projects.\" Projects are extremely beneficial and they can be in different forms like posters, presentations, models, videos, etc. Projects are very profitable, especially, in the long summer vacations because these introduces new ideas to students. Researching and building a project should both be interesting to students because then students will place their full effort, due to their enthusiasm. However, some schools require students to complete the teacher-designed projects. This means that students have to complete the teacher's-designed projects. What if the project is about the topic which students do not like to study about? Their lack of interest could lead them towards learning nothing about the specific topic. I believe, that schools must require students to complete summer projects of their own preference to assure they continue learning because it can help students in becoming more knowledgeable about the topic and can assist them in achieving their goals.\n \n The primary reason that why students should be allowed to have their own-designed projects is that it helps them to become more knowledgeable about the particular topic. One example of the benefits of student-designed projects is that the topic which interests them more, they are willing to put their 100% effort in researching and understanding about the topic. For instance, a student have interests in researching about the bad effects of ultraviolet rays from the sun on people. The student who enjoys this topic would not only research about the bad effects of these rays on people, but also would be automatically encouraged to go more dense to its roots, such as, effects on aquatic wildlife, atmosphere, etc. Another example of the benefits of student-designed projects is that the students can teach others about what they have learned through their research. Not everyone is aware about the bad effects of ultraviolet rays. So, the student who is already acquainted with this topic can detail the adverse impacts of these rays to his/her youngsters and even elders. Then the society of ours will also be in less danger because if everyone is aware about the adverse effects of these rays, people will be more cautious and apply precautions to stay healthy. Based on this evidence, schools should require students to complete their own-designed project, as it helps them in becoming more knowledgeable.\n \n Another reason of why schools should require students to complete summer projects of their own choice is that it is helpful in achieving their goals through the research about their interests. All the research that the project requires to have, might convey students to think and choose their particular career path. Teenagers often over thinkÂ about their future jobs and overwhelm themselves. They might consider going into the field about which they are unaware of. This makes them change their minds swiftly, from one career to another. The shifting of minds affects students when they graduate from their schools, and are unclear about their careers. But, the students which have already researched about the jobs for their careers and have made projects on their interests, they become more successful in their lives. This is because, research made them more aware about the positives and negatives of the specific careers. Another example of the benefit of the student-designed project is that the students who already researched their fields for their careers, will have the potential to make their wishes come true. Successful career paths always provide the good amount of salary. Students can use their this capital to buy houses, cars, etc. Based on these proofs, the students through their own designed projects, can choose a career path that suits them well and can fulfill their dreams.\n \n While the above specific examples shows that the schools should require the students to design their own preferred summer projects, one can argue otherwise. Some people might argue that the teachers are more knowledgeable about what the students should be learning about. That without the teacher's directions, the students will get off task. But, what if the teacher assigns the project about Mahatma Gandhi's struggles in his life? Students even if they lack interest in this topic, have to complete the project anyway. Lacking interests in a specific topic also lead students to a stage where they cannot contribute their 100% to their projects because this is what they don't have their interests in. Therefore, from their little amount of effort, they will not be able to obtain good amount of scores. Whereas, if the teachers themselves asks students to complete their own designed projects, students will never hesitate to provide their 100% effort to the project. This is so because, this would be about something they want to study more and research on. The more effort students put into their projects, the more better they score.\n \n In conclusion, I believe that the schools should require the summer projects to be student-designed and not to be teacher-designed because this helps the students to obtain more knowledge about the topic they enjoy.\n \n Student-designed projects captivates more attention of the students to research deeper and deeper. This eventually helps the students to get to know about that topic from its roots. The idea of Student-designed projects also assists students to achieve their goals, which eventually make them successful in their lives. Through much research, a certain field might get more interesting to a student than before. They might end up choosing that career. That is why, I believe that the schools should require students to design their own-designed projects.Â",

    essay:
      "Throughout my adolescent past, I've had a vigorous number of summer assignments. Whether it was a Algebra 1 packet or a summer reading assignment, teachers never fail to overwhelm there students with work before the year even begins. Most summer assignmentsÂ are enforced by the teachers and lack any student input. A majority of students show little interest in the assignments they are presented and approach the work with a negative attitude rather than optimism. Although a student-designed summer project is a chance for students to exhibit there work in a more enjoyable fashion, a teacher-designed project would work better because teachers understand what work will best prepare students and shows the type of projects teachers will assign in the future.\n \n A reason why teachers should design the projects is because they understand what work will best prepare students. Many teachers have attained an advanced education in there subject. Unlike the students, the teacher knows exactly what the course will consist of, and the level of difficulty that they will cover. In most classes, students start the year with no prior knowledge of the subject they will cover. An example of there unpreparedness is that large portions of high school students switch out of classes because they don't know the level of the work that they will be covering.Â A student led project could be void of any important information. If they find an area of the subject thats more difficult than the others, they could address that area more than another part of the subject.Â Assignments created by teachers would be a prime opportunity for teachers to demonstrate the work they will cover, and help a student drop the class if the work seems too challenging. A summer assignment is before the year starts, so switching your classes wouldn't interrupt your school year.\n \n Another reason teachers should design the projects is because it shows what type of assignments will follow in the future. Teachers are a people of habit. Throughout the year, they will assign projects that are very similar to each other, following similar guidelines. An example of repetition in school is teachers assigning a variation of slide show presentations. Throughout the school year, many teachers conduct slide show presentations within new concepts. If a student were to design the summer project, it could be an entirely different format then any format suggested by a teacher. With the teacher in control, they could give you a project very similar to one that you may face in the future.\n \n Many believe that if enjoy what your doing, than you will be more productive. A student getting to choose what type of project they will do could introduce the topic in more exciting manner. While enjoying what you do is important, it may also not prepare a student to the best of it's capabilities. A student led project may not cover the ground that it needs to cover. For example, the students could decide to write a one paragraph reflection on an area of the subject that they found interesting. The problem with that format is that it may only tackle a small portion of the subject, and you wouldn't be able to reflect on what others found interesting, which would help you remember the information better.\n \n The teachers should design the project that the students work on. They know what work will best to prepare students and help them succeed. Teachers understand the subject far greater than any student designing the project. A more rigorous area of the subject could be addressed more in the project. If the teacher creates all of the future projects, than the summer project could reflect the type of projects teachers will assign in the future. Repetition is prominent within classrooms, and a summer assignment created by the teacher could offer incite into future projects. With a student in control of the project, they may only address a small area of the subject that will come up later in the year. While a student-designed summer project can make there work more enjoyable, a teacher-designed project would be better for students, because teachers understand what will prepare them best and is a way to discover the type of projects teachers will assign in the future.Â  Â",

      "Should students really be making the summer projects? Students making the summer projects would help the students focus more on the project, help make the project less stressful, and could figure out a way to involve their family.\n \n If a student designes a project they are going to make sure it interests them. They aren't going to make it something they dont want to do. Some might say the students aren't going to know what information to learn and use in the project. If teachers work with students they can figure out a way to make sure that they students learn all the information they need to. Teachers can even give them a rubric with all the information the students need to use.\n \n When you are doing something that you enjoy you stress about it less. Especially when you're on summer vacation doing a summer project is the last thing that you want to be doing. Kids would much rather hang out with friends or play video games. If students are designing the projects they will design something that is less time consuming or more easy to manage . While some agree with this others are concered that students would make the project too easy. Teachers at the end of the day are assigning the project, they can put guidelines and expectations on top of the students project design.\n \n During summer vacation lots of students will travel and go places with family. Students can figure out a way to involve family members making the project easier to do on the road. Having a parent help out on a project helps out and helps kids stress less. While doing a project with family members might distract students from learning some say doing a project with parents might help kids focus as well. No kid wants to mess around during a project with their parents.\n \n In conclusion, there are many benefits to allowing the students to design their own project. If students were to be allowed to design their own summer projects it would help students focus more on the project, it wouldn't be a super stressful project and students could involve their family.Â",

Students should have a oppertunity to pick their own summer projects because it allows them to be more creative. It will give students less of a chance to cheat off each other. It will also help the teachers know more about their students, what they struggle with and what they understand.\n \n Students can be more creative and willing to do the project if they get to design it themselves. If its about something that is special to them they will put more effort into doing it. Most of the summer projects I got I didnt do because it didn't interest me at all. In English, they usually give out a summer reading list of books they want you to read. I would try to read the books that were on the list but they never made me want to finish it. If I had the oppertunity to pick my own books then I would read all summer.\n \n Letting students pick there own project would keep kids from cheating because if they have to pick their own topic then two kids can't write about the same thing the exact same way. Most students do their project at the last minute and schedules come out toward the end of summer. Therefore, they match their classes together or see if they have the same teacher and then they share answers before school even starts. Students shouldn't be given out packets with all the exact same questions because they will just cheat and learn nothing. Instead, we should be given projects that we get to pick.\n \n If we get to pick projects that mean somethng to us then the teachers can know more about who we are and not just by some packet with questions. Students could make projects about something that happened in their life or something that means a lot to them. Most teachers don't even care to know your name not to mentin who you even are. I still have teachers that ask me what my name is when they write a pass for me and i have been in school for almost 6 months. If students could do projects that mean something to them then maybe teachers would know who they are and not just some paper they are grading.\n \n In conclsion, Students should pick their projects and desgin the projects themselves.

      "Do you think summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed? In my opinion, summer project should be student-designed. For students, summer is a break from school; students should have the freedom to do a project based on what they want. Reasons why I believe summer projects should be student-designed is because it gives students the ability to be creative, they feel less pressured, and it gives them responsibility.\n \n First reason why I believe summer projects should be student-designed is because it gives students the ability to be creative. If students come up with what their projects is based on, it shows their creativeness. They can describe and show their personality through their project. They can also show their character and more about who they are. This can be a opportunity for students to open up with their teacher and classmates. Students can come out their comfort zone and be unique when creating their project.\n \n Second reason why I believe summer projects should be student-designed is because students feel less pressured. If students have a certain project, they feel more pressured to do exactly what the project is based on. The project may be based on a subject they may not feel comfortable with. If students have a student-designed project, they will avoid that conflict because they will be able to choose their own topic. This may also pressure students because they could get a project that doesn't appeal to their personality.\n \n Third reason why I believe summer projects should be student-designed is because it gives students responsibility. Students will have all summer to create their project; if the project is not done, it shows they aren't responsible. The project shows if they can be able to do a project before the new school year begins. Certain students will prove they're able to complete a project throughout the summer. While others will prove they aren't responsible enough to complete a project. In addition, this will give them a task to do while they aren't in school.\n \n In conclusion, I believe that summer projects should be student-based. My reasons on why I believe this should be a student-designed project is because it gives students the ability to be creative, they feel less pressured, and it gives them responsibility. A summer project should be a project you are comfortable with and can show how you unique every individual is. The project will also keep students feeling educated while not being in school.",

Those who oppose this state that teachers should design student's projects, but this is not true. Although some may disagree students should be allowed to design summer break projects.\n \n There are a variety of reasons why students should design summer break projects. If students where allowed to design projects, one would be able to find an enjoyable topic to focus on. For example, instead of a book review, one could write about a destination they are visiting over the summer. This allows students to enjoy their summer break while still completing school assignments. The summer time is a time for rest; however, students still need to complete assigned projects.

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. There is an ongoing debate if these summer projects should be teacher- designed orÂ student- designed. Those that disagree state it's easier on yourself and brings out your own ideas and creativity, but this is not true. Although some may disagree, summer projects should be teacher- designed.\n \n There are a variety of reasons why summer projects should be teacher- designed. The teacher can challenge the students. For example, if I was assigned a project where I can pick my own topic I wouldn't do a lotÂ to where it's hard work. Furthermore, the teacher can also prepare you for next year and do the topic about something you're going to learn about. Doing a project of my own choice of topic wouldn't help me next year. Also, it lets the teacher see who can do it and who needs more time and help. Every year is different and working on a project designed by the teacher can help you get ready.\n \n There are further reasons why summer projects should be teacher-designed. One reason is to have a topic to the subject. Doing a project about my favorite song wouldn't help me with science. A teacher- designed project can also better your work. When your teacher assign a project about a topic your going to learn next year, you will already know about it because you did a project on it. Lastly, doing summer projects prepare your brain for school.

School summer projects have the capability to prepare students for a class and help students succeed. Schools that require students to complete summer projects should make the projects student-designed because they will help students learn the material, students will perform better in the class, and students will retain the material for a longer time.\n \n School summer projects should be student-designed because they will help students learn. If school projects are student-designed students will learn the required information for the class easier. Furthermore, this allows them to understand the material in greater depth, rather than if the projects were teacher-designed. Teachers should already understand the information for the class. This means, that if projects were teacher-designed it would not help the teachers anymore, because they are not the people completing the projects, and students will not benefit as much because the projects are not geared towards them.\n \n School summer projects should be student-designed because they will help students perform better in the class. To get good grades in the class, students answer questions based on their unit of learning. Therefore, if students understand the material they will perform better on the tests. Student-designed projects help the students understand the material, so students will perform better on tests. Also, students who do better on the tests will enjoy the class more than students who do not do well on the tests. Students will also be happier with themselves if they have a good grade in the class.\n \n School summer projects should be student-designed because they will help students retain the material for a longer time. Summer projects that are student-designed will not only help students understand the material for one test, but they will remember the material for the length of the course and possible even longer. Student-designed summer projects will help students retain the material for the rest of the course and any future courses that are related to the first course they took. This could also affect the workplace. Students who are taking a course related to their current job or a job that they are looking for in the future will have the material retained that will help them. This means that they have the ability to do well in their job, and they will make a good living for themselves and their family.\n \n Student-designed summer projects help students, the people who need it, to learn the material, rather than teachers, who should already know the material. Because students understand the material, they will perform better on tests and will be enjoy the class more and be happier with themselves. Also, students will retain the material for a longer period of time. That will make it easier for students in the rest of the course, and related courses they might take in the future, and current and future employment.

      'Schools give many projects and homework assignments to assure the student knows the information, and it also gives them a chance to learn something new. Schools give projects during spring break, winter break, and even our longest break during the summer. Many of these projects are made or designed by a teacher, while some have a basic outline and are mostly designed by the students. Projects should be designed mostly by the students, and many agree with this statement as well.\n \n Summer break projects should be mostly designed by the student because this makes the students strengths and weaknesses easier to indicate. This allows the teacher to understand what his/her students need help with. They can guide the student on how to perfect their strengths and improve on their weaknesses. An example of this would be if a student is bad at giving examples in essays. If the student is given an essay on "What was the most impactful battle of WWII" , they have many examples to choose from and many reasons those examples would be chosen. But if the student is given an essay on "Why should video cameras be used" , their mediocre examples will be easier to notice as not as many facts back up the opinions on if cameras should be used or not. Some may say since student-designed essays show the students flaws, their flaws could cause them to get a poor grade. While this is true in some cases, it is better the student\'s teacher see his/her mistakes now and help them improve on them, rather than before the big test. Although this is indeed one, there are many more examples of why summer projects should be student-designed.\n \n Summer break projects should be mostly designed by the student because this allows more creative freedom and ideas on the essay/project. A student has free range to think of new ideas if they are not put on a metaphorical leash by the teacher. They can explore new ideas which in turn could make their essay much better and even teach the teacher something they never knew before. A satisfactory example of this would be if the teacher assigned an essay where the student could write about whatever they want, but they had to relate it to racism. The student could write about slavery, the Civil Rights Movement, Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, and they could even write about hip hop. But if the teacher tells the student to write an essay about " Why we read books" or " Why we eat food" the students will all have similar responses. They will say something along the lines of " We read books for the knowledge and information they give us" or " We eat food because food is a necessity our body needs to function properly". These essays/projects are very linear and do not bring anything creative to the table. A few may say that allowing full creative freedom on essays will cause students to drift away from the central idea of the essay and dive into personal opinion. Of course it is inevitable this will happen to some, good writers will know to not do this and will stay on the topic of their essay, while the writers who went astray will get some help from their teachers on how to improve that.\n \n Summer break projects should be mostly designed by students because this will encourage the student to do better on their essays/projects. Allowing freedom on a project allows the students to try as hard as they possibly can, while if they were given a project on something that disinterests them, they will only do what is required. If a student that is a fan of Lil Uzi Vert(rapper) is given a project on " The Evolution of Classical Music" , they are only going to do the minimum requirements of that project, while if they are given a project on Effect of Old Rap on New Hip Hop" , they will be more interested as it relates to something they hold dear. Some people may say that the students should already be encouraged to do the project since it is an important grade at the beginning of your school year, which is true, but some students need to be motivated in order to want to go the extra mile, and doing a project on one of your favorite artists is the right motivation.\n \n Summer break projects seem to have a negative vibe around them. Not many want to do them, and some think we shouldn\'t have them, but if we are going to have to do a project over the summer it should be about something e like or something we hold dear. Our families, our friends, our hobbies, our music taste, etc. Doing summer break projects on things that relates to us encourages us to do better, shows our flaws, and gives us freedom to run wild.Â',

    essay:
      "The concept of summer break presents many flaws to the school system. It causes students to lose vital information they learned the year prior and creates a lazy atmosphere with the absence of work. The clear solution to this is summer assignments and projects, yet some wonder who deserves to decide what the projects should consist of. Summer projects, a key tool to ensure continued enrichment, should be student designed to allow opportunities for creativity, increased enjoyment while working, as well as higher rates of motivation to continuously work on the project in order to nurture passion and a love for this work within students.\n \n During the school year teachers are obligated to obtain a set amount of grades and fit a certain curriculum, yet during summer these rules no longer apply. This leaves summer as the perfect time to allow for creativity with learning. One such example is the Sustainable Technology Class. This is a project driven class where students are given guidelines to fulfill and that is it. Many of the students taking this course have a passion for the material and need a chance to see all of the possibilities it can hold. With this class specific, originality could lead to a revolutionary invention, such as electricity generating bicycles or solar powered toys. Through this experience a student can truly fall in love with the world of science and decide to create a career out of it. A cpncept very similar to professors being able to do any research they can get approved within their budget. Also, including student led work could help school systems break the factory system pattern of the school year in which you do your assigned work and keep the classroom silent. Our current system, where students have very little say, easily leads to anxiety, exhaustion, and eventually, for some, fully dropping out of high school. By offering a chance to have a self designed, teacher approved project, students can fully appreciate knowledge in a way the benefits the individual.\n \n Once the door to creativity and choice has been opened, enjoyment has to follow. In 1800's France, a new style of art was emerging, impressionism. If these talented and famous painters, such as Monet and Van Gogh, solely followed the advice of their instructors and refused to step out to paint what they enjoy, we would not have beautiful works like Starry Night. If they had not branched out and followed their intuition and joy, they may never have continued painting due to constant belittlement of the art style they preferred. Our museums would be repetitions of the same work with very little diversity. This is true for essentially all art, another example of this is the Rock Revolution. If stars such as Elvis and the Beatles only followed the era of Big Band music and never were allowed to play and create what they enjoyed, music could have never evolved. With each generation, the world learns more and more. Advancements would never occur if every project was solely based off of the knowledge of the teacher.\n \n Finally, for the average student, September through June is an endless pattern of early mornings, tests, and work sheets created by their teachers. More importantly September through June is a pattern of procrastination for many students. Due to dread about a certain assignment or just plain boredom, work piles up and leaves the student to rush through it carelessly before the due date. A perfect example of this is Love Canal, New York. In the 1970's a community was built over a former dumping ground for radioactive waste. The families quickly noticed issues such as minor chemical burns from the grass and black sludge seeping into their houses, but the government ignored the growing tragedy. There was no action taken until 18 out of 21 children were born with severe chromosomalÂ defects. By this point, the government was forced to spend thousands of dollars in relocating the families as well as reparations, hospital bills, and environmental recovery. If they had not procrastinated, then it would have been considerably less expensive and would not have been as horrific as it ended up being. While this example may not directly highlight the issues within teacher driven projects, it does show what a consistent habit of procrastination can lead to. Which is what the school system instills in students by not allowing decision making. It is undeniable that when people care about the project being done, they are will put time and energy into it through out the whole experience, not just the ending.\n \n While there are some benefits to teacher driven projects, such as the possibility for concise instructions and often an obvious path to follow, these just allow the students to be overly protected and lazy. This prevents the potential for growth that comes from creating something and succeeding in it without the help of an adult. It also instills the idea that there will always be someone telling you what to do. Which is very harmful once these students get to the work field. They will be unprepared due to never doing fully original and individual work, and the school system would be the one to blame.\n \n In our modern world, we need innovation more than anything else. Young minds need to be nurtured, but also allowed to follow their own path of individuality and creativity. The only way to ensure the growth of these important traits is to loosen the leash and allow students to make some of the decisions. It is just one project per year, but a country wide switch could be revolutionary.Â",

Nowadays, schools want you to do some of project or activity to assure that you have more knowledge and learning throughout the break. If these projects are really going to happen, they should be teacher-designed. If these projects are designed by teachers, then they are most likely going to be more educational, you can get hands-on help from a teacher, and overall they can allow you to become more prepared for the upcoming school year.\n \n Firstly, these summer projects should be teacher-designed because they can be more educational for the students. By doing this, you can learn many things that you never knew before. Such as ; a certain word problem, how to do an equation, or many other things as well. When the summer projects are finally over, you will be able to look back and see what all new information you have learned.\n \n Secondly, you can get better hands-on help from the teacher. Say one of the projects is about somethingÂ you have never seen or learned before. Obviously you are going to need to get help or a teacher's assistance. Instead of having to solve the problem by yourself, you can get someone's help so you can figure out what to do and how to do it.\n \n Thirdly, overall a project designed by a teacher will allow yourself to be be more prepared for the up and coming school year. If you have a project based on one of the classes you are going to take next year, you can start preparing based on that. You can start learning what the class is all about too. At the end of the day, no matter what type of activity or project it is, it will prepare you for the next school year.\n \n In conclusion, it is better for summer projects assigned by the school to be teacher-designed. In the end, they are way more educational than a project designed by a student them self. If you are not understanding something,or if it is difficult to complete, the teacher can help you out. Also in the long run, it will prepare and better yourself for the next school year.",

Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers know what is expected to be learned, it will be fair to the students, and teachers already have more experience in designing assignments.\n \n Teachers are already well informed about the curriculum about the subject they teach, and they also know some of the curriculum for the other classes related to the subject. For example, a math teacher for Algebra 1 has also taught Geometry in the past. Since he has experience in Geometry, he knows what his students should expect in the next year when they take Geometry. The students were only exposed to the content in Algebra 1, therefore making it more productive if the math teacher designed the summer project. By implementing content of the next school year into the summer project, students will be better prepared for the class. Because teachers teach the curriculum for the students, they know what is most important/useful to remember. For instance, a Biology 1 teacher knows that the unit focused on animal and plant cell anatomy is crucial to remember because it is always used in Biology in general, so she mostly focuses the project with cell anatomy. It is beneficial to students if they are informed what is expected to be to know in the future. Teachers who know what is most useful to know would design summer projects more 3ly by knowing what content to emphasize. Students do not know what is important to learn because they are in the process of learning, so having them design summer projects would not 3ly help them better prepare over the summer.\n \n If students are assigned to design a summer project, they are most likely to do something that is personalized to be easy for themselves with a lot of bias, which is not fair to everyone. Such as, English 10 students were expected to come up with comprehension questions for a book, and they ended up creating questions that were easy to them, but very difficult for other students. Students would not know how to create assessments that would cater to everyone's level of knowledge. Since teachers oversee the class, they would know what kinds of questions to create that would best fit for the class's knowledge, with no bias. If there was student bias involved in designing a project, many other students will have complaints and disagree with the components of the project. For example, a history teacher who assigned a project did not receive a single complaint compared to when a student proposed a project. If students know that the project was designed by the teacher, it will significantly decrease the amount of complaints and the students would just accept it because he is a higher authority. By having the teacher design the project, students will all have a fair assignment to do with no bias since it was designed by the teacher. Having students design a project could create a lot of disagreement.\n \n Teachers have more experience in teaching and the basics of learning. They have traditionally always created and designed assignments in the past. For instance, a Psychology teacher has been teaching for over ten years knows how to create 3 projects for his students. Since he has been teaching for over ten years, he has more experience and knows what he is doing. People with more experience can design better quality projects than someone who is still learning, Teachers know what techniques to use to 3ly assess knowledge. An example is that an English teacher added more steps for annotating a book because she knows that it actually helps students understand the book better. A student would not like to add more steps in annotating a book because it is more work, but they do not know that is is very helpful in the long run. The process of learning is more likely to be 3 if the assignment was designed by a teacher because they have more experience. It is important for students to learn with purpose and practice beneficial habits.\n \n If teachers designed summer projects, it would be beneficial to the students' learning. It would ensure that students are learning the correct information needed, would be be just for all the students, and it would be more efficient since teachers have more experience. The purpose of summer projects is to continue learning in students over the break, and teachers definitely have the power to do that.",

      "Summer projects, some schools have these projects to complete during the summmer so students do not have to completley stop learning during the break. The assignments are more than likely created by a teacher; What if the students created the assignments though?\n \n i believe that if student's created the project it would probably be easier than a teachers project, for the benefit of summer. On the other hand if teachers designs the project it will come with more work and more information for the benefit of real learning.\n \n Student designed projects, in my opinion, will probably help teachers in the short run because of the fact that teachers will not have to worry about creating a project. In the long run though, i believe students will not learn anything new. i think student's will just create it and make it easy just to get it over with and begin their summer. Or make it easy enough to just procrastinate about it all break and complete it at the end of summer. Even creating the project is more work for the students which i think will have some students not even trying to do it. If the project is created by students i think mostly all of the students will complete it and turn it in because of how easy they made it to be.\n \n Teacher designed projects, These projects will have what the teacher's and school want students to study during break. Teachers will actually create it to be work that will leave students with information that is needed and that should not be forgotten, for future puposes like for classes that they will be taking when back from break. I think a good amount of people would not complete the assignment due to the fact that teachers make them hard and actually have you do work. Students would rather be doing anything than a project during the summer. Teacher designed projects will help students out more in the long run because teacher's know what students need to study and focus on.\n \n So, in my opinion a teacher designed project is for the benefit of the student's learning. A student designed project though, is for the benefit of the student's summer. In both cases though the student is going to be working on it thoughout summer and keeping in touch with learning. I think it would be best if a teacher designed project was given for the summer. If the chance was given to me to create one though, i would definetly rather do that.Â",

      "In some schools, summer projects are assigned to assure that students will continue learning well after the school year ends. Although students should continue to learn during their break, some have argued that if the projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed. Student-designed is the better option because students will have more options to chose from, they can do a project they're interested in, and teacher-designed projects are annoying to produce.\n \n Many teachers would complain that students won't have any directions to follow on their projects and will thus not continue learning during their break. Although, students not having any directions on how to make their projects is true. This can be viewed as a purely subjective point, since this'll give students more freedom on how they want their projects to be. Another point of discussion is is that students won't continue to further learn during their break. This viewpoint that students won't continue to learn is wrong due to the fact that students will be learning while creating their projects.\n \n Having more options for students to choose from is great because students can create a project of something they're interested in with high effort. In the past, teachers would only give students one option for a project idea; therefore, limiting the chance of something that student would interested in and lowering the effort. For example, if a student was given the freedom to write about a certain sport they're interested in, they could make a well informed slide show to present to a class or could talk forever about their favorite team in a podcast. A student would choose to write something they're interested rather than having to read a long book than having to write a big essay any day.\n \n Students can make projects more enjoyable is a valid point because it can show their creativity. Since students won't have any directions on how to make their projects, they can be as creative as they want. They can try out new ways to present projects like showing a cool infographic or make a fun video that can inform a class about a topic they worked on. This could make the actual work process of the project more enjoyable to the student and whoever they're presenting it too.\n \n The third reason why student-designed is the better option is because teachers can make projects annoying for the students. Teachers can sometimes make students go out of their way to work on their projects. To include, teachers can make it so students have to visit somewhere to get information to further continue working on their projects or make students have to buy certain books to write about. This may not seem so bad at first glance; however, for some students who go visit out of the country for the majority of the break can be a nightmare for them. Imagine a student being gone for the majority of the break just to come back and only have a little less than week to visit a musesum and write an essay about it. This situation shows how teachers make projects annoying for these types of students.\n \n In conclusion, a student-designed project is better because students can choose what they want to talk about, projects would be more enjoyable for everyone, and students won't have to go out of their way from teacher-designed projects. Having more freedom in options leads to students picking something they're interested in.\n \n Students also show their creativity thus making it more enjoyable. finally, teachers make students go out of their way for projects; therefore, making it annoying for some students who travel.",

      "Summer break, most students favorite time of the year, the time of long hot summer days by the pool or even at the beach. This break given is a moderate period of time given to students and teachers throughoutÂ the hottest months of the year. Many children spend this time with their friends and family, some even take the opportunity to get a summer job. However some schools feel it is necessary to give their students an excessive amount of school work to do complete the summer. Many of these summer assignments are from classes including Math, English, and even some AP classes. Most summer assignments given do not provide an explanation of how to complete it, which leaves many students clueless and with no desire to complete their task. Students should be provide to pick an assignment that appeals most to them, in order to give them a drive to complete the work.\n \n Summer break is supposed to be enjoyable days away from school with no stress. Giving these students school work over their times off is not fair to them nor is it fair to the teachers. When this work is given, large amounts of students choose not to complete it; or they chose to complete it but not with the best of their abilities. Most summer assignments that are given are not beneficial to the student when they return to school. In fact, many teachers do not discuss the summer assignment with the students and some have even chose to not put in the grade because many of their students did not complete it, which is not fair to the students that took the time out of their summer to complete it. With summer assignments being mandatory, students should be able to choose their assignments based on the classes they will be taking, in order to make their summer a little more enjoyable. No student wants to complete an assignment they have no interest in.\n \n Almost all teachers a facultyÂ spend their summer days off relaxing with their families and enjoying their time off, as they should. However they do not grade nor complete assignments for the students. Yes toward the end of the summer teachers have to go back to school earlier than their students to ensure their rooms are set up, cleaned, and ready for the children to return. School faculty also have to attend a few meetings together to make sure the upcoming school year will go smoothly. If students apply their summer time to the assignments the teachers should also apply their time to explaining the assignments throughly before their vaction.\n \n A class that students need to have in order to continue learning over the summer, is math. Math is a subject that people use everyday. The assignments math teachers give should provide helpful ways for the student to learn and complete the assignment if it is something they may not know how to do. Most students do complete their summer assignments before summer break, which means they can ask for help from teachers around them. However some wait until they have down time to complete these assignments which causes them to forget how to complete it. All assignments that are given should give the student a clear understanding of how the teacher may want it to be completed, with an example to help assist the student for when the teacher is not around.\n \n If the summer assignment that is assigned does not benefit the student and will not be brought up or discussed after they turn it in, it should not be given for them to complete on their days off. The assignments teachers assign are usually not enjoyable and take large periods of time to complete. IfÂ assignmentsÂ must be given over the summer, students should have a choice from a variety of assignments to choose from; such as a power pointÂ on somewhere historical they could have visited over the summer or even reading a chosen book the class will read together during theÂ upcomingÂ school year\n \n Students should not have to take time out of their days off the complete an assignment that will not help them in the up coming school year. Many students find summer assignments boting and unenjoyable, which is why they choose to not complete them. This is why students should be able to pick an assignment that appeals most to them, in order to give them a desire to do the work.Â Â",

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue their learning during the break. Every individual at some point in their life has had to make a project of their own. Whether it be a project at school or a project at home for themselves to enjoy. So when it comes to these summer projects, they should be student-designed because an individual has more freedom to choose a topic of their own, they are less restrictive, and students can use their best strengths to make a project that is less stressful for them.\n \n A student has more freedom when choosing a topic of their own with a student-designed project. For instance, a lot of the projects in school are tied to a specific topic. When it comes to choosing the type of project, at a first glance, there may seem like there is a lot to choose from. But in reality, this is just the illusion of choice. There isn't a lotÂ of room for creativity and imagination, therefore there isn't much freedom. Many individuals will agree that with more freedom, they have the liberties and creativity to come up with something that is unique. Others may argue that with more freedom, a student might not stick to what they what they are supposed to learn, But that is far from the truth. It is the opposite, students are more restricted when they are forced to create a project with a topic they are not the best at, which leads to the next point.\n \n Student-designed projects are less restrictive. For instance, much of the work we are assigned in school is teacher-designed. From personal experience, when a project is teacher-designed, a lot of the work can be mediocre, as apposed to a project that is student-designed. When students aren't allowed to come up with their own ideas, their imagination is bound and restricted. Some teachers may argue that it doesn't matter that students are restricted, all that matters is that a student gets the work done, but that is not correct. The student wont be as motivated and will turn in a project that is has no effort, therefore getting a lower grade.\n \n individuals can use their best strengths to make a project that is less stressful for them with student-designed projects. A project can seem like a large and outstanding task to finish for a large amount of students, and as a result, puts stress on an individual. A student-designed project can relieve plenty of this stress, as students can choose a subject that they are best at. It is easier for someone as they are more comfortable with a topic they are more knowledgeable with. Other individuals may argue that students should make an effort to choose a subject they aren't familiar with, but many can disagree because choosing a topic someone isn't familiar with puts more stress on a person and can lead to them struggling to learn.\n \n Summer projects help students learn during the break, but students should ultimately decide on designing their own projects for individuals to continue to learn. At the end of the day, they should have the freedom to enjoy doing what they are best at they shouldnt be stressed over work they aren't comfortable with in the summer.Â  Â Â Â Â Â",

Most students would agree that student designed projects would very much benefit them. In ways such as they can actually know what topic or subject they are doing,it can show one students creativity abilities,and the students may be really be interested in the project that they are doing.\n \n First,when teachers assign a summer project it might be something that the student may not know or can not get a grasp of because it is too difficult for them to understand.

But if that is the case then if the teacher did notÂ choose the project then the creativity would go through the roof due to the many of creative minds of students and they would be limitless.

      "Its that time of year where students have to complete a summer project. These projects are a way of making sure that the students are learning and being productive throughout their summer vacation. Students best know their own interests, so, summer projects should be student-designed because it ensures that students will be engaged, leads to completion of the project, and promotes the continuation of their interests.\n \n Although, some people may think that student-designed summer projects are not the best way to have students continue their education. For the reasons of it leads to researching non-important topics or results in students not taking the project seriously. This point of view makes sense because if the projects are teacher-designed it would ensure that all students are learning about something important and valuable to their education. However, this point of view is wrong because the definition of an important topic is different to everyone. Students will do the summer project on something of importance or value to them because they have the option to make it something or their own and make it unique.\n \n Students will always become engaged in a topic if the have the freedom to choose it. While students are getting ready to choose what they want to do during the summer they will become interested about the topic they choose. This will make sure that students are kept interested throughoutÂ the summer to produce something that they are proud of. For example, a students favorite animal is a panda and he or she wants to research, visit museums, visit libraries, and visit the zoo to learn more about them and be able to come up with a good project. This student is eager to learn about something he or she loves and is passionate about. This project will keep this student fully engaged through the summer learning about the panda. All students have something that they are interested in and if they choose a topic and create a project it may even open and door to a passion they were not aware of.\n \n In addition, the completion of the student-designed summer project is critical to their learning because without the completion of it students will not get the full experience of learning what they picked on their project. If students are allowed to design their own projects the teachers will not have to worry about a students not completing the project because they became uninterested or bored. Students will be eager to complete their projects and that is all a teacher could want is to have a student eager about a project and then complete it because they wanted to not because they were forced to. For example a student is given the topic of rocks and the student has never had an interest in this. The student will struggle because they have no interest in researching rocks. This student will most likely not complete the project or will do it in the last week of summer. This prevents students of having a valuable learning experience with something that they like.\n \n As well as students having a variety of interests, if the summer projects are student-designed they could explore an area of interest that they are already familiar with and dive in deep to what they like. This could help a student find out more information on a topic they think they may like or already know that they have a passion for. For example, if a student is interested in medicine and they want to become a doctor why would they need to research rocks? This student will have the time to research what she wants to do with her future while also completing her schools requirement. It is a great thing for a young student to already be setting their mind into what they will like to do in their future and researching it.\n \n Summer learning projects should be student-designed because it help ensure that students will be engaged, leads to project completion, and allows for the continuation of personal interests. Students need to have a time to be able to research and make a project on a topic that they enjoy learning about and what better time than the summer to do that. Young students are the future, so, the schools should permit student-designed summer projects to have the students better understand the topic of their choice. The next time students have to do summer project they should be allowed to designÂ it and stride for their best educational experience.Â  Â Â Â",

      "Summer Projects\n \n Summer break is a students favorite time of year. It is a vacation from school, five days a week, for three months. The only exception to this is a summer project. Teachers assign summer projects to their upcoming classes, so when school starts again they have not forgotten everything they previously learned and are prepared for what the new school year has in store. Although some people can argue that students should be given options for their summer assignments, it is best to leave that job to the professionals because they are the ones trying to refresh, prepare, and teach students. Even if the teacher does pick the topic, that does not mean students cannot be creative and think outside the box.\n \n If students got to pick their own topics, maybe they would feel inspired and put in more effort, but it is more likely that they would do something easy they already know about. The whole point of a summer project is to keep their brain refreshed over the summer. For example, if your teacher asked you to read any book and write a report on it, it would be easy to pick a book you have already read or even Google a summary of a random book, but if your teacher picked the book, then you would read a book you probably have not read and actually learn something new.Â Copying down what you find online or using a book you read two years ago will not help you grow academically or refresh your mind.\n \n The whole point of a summer project is to keep their brain refreshed over the summer. Since teachers already know the curriculum, before the year even starts, a simple summer project is perfect to keep their brain active while familiarizing them with new material. Even just writing a short poem inspired by the Romanticism Era with an analysis is a good way to introduce a subject they might not know a lot about. Summer projects do not have to be hard or long, just enough to give a preview of what they will be learning. A specific topic also allows a more detailed rubric because it tells you exactly what to do, whereas if everyone picked, the rubric would not be specific or very helpful.\n \n Teachers can pick the topic of a summer assignment without taking the individuality out. If the teacher picks a topic, it is obviously something they know about already. Teachers picking the assignment also reduces confusion and encourages student collaboration to talk to each other about the task to better understand. Any project you get regardless of it being during the summer or the school is meant to prepare you for the future. High school is all about preparing you, whether that is something as small as starting a new school year to going to college.\n \n Every single thing you do in life can teach you something. That is why teachers are so important because they get paid to teach students, like me. Even if it seems pointless, it is important to still do it because in the end, just completing the task shows perseveranceÂ and teaches students not to procrastinate. Nobody would hand out projects for fun. All assignments are to benefit their students in the long run. It is also important to try to have fun while doing school work because if your mind is open to new things, you might like what you are learning. Getting assigned a topic is not meant to put you in a box, it is meant to give a topic to explore.\n \n We should leave the teaching to the teachers. Let them decide the best way to teach us because that is what they are here for. If they want us to really understand their lessons, they should pick the assignments to ensure they get the results they desire. Teachers went to school to learn the best methods of teaching, so we should trust them to refresh, prepare, and teach students everything they need to know.",

      "Summer Projects for school should be Teacher-designed because it will show students the expectations for the course, helps them learn the specific material that is needed, and keeps students on track. The main part of summer projects is to assure that students continue their learning process. While schools have long breaks at a time, it is difficult to come back and still remember all of the things that was taught before being let out for a long amount of time. Teachers and student both struggle to jump back into the schedule of going to school each day. Many students have a hard time maintaining everything after being a way and not looking at the material for a while. Some schools require students to complete assignments or projects during a long period break to maintain their learning abilities, but if students are not given the right objective, then they are bound to not learn anything. There are many examples on why summer projects should be teacher-designed.\n \n First, students need expectations and requirements for school projects because it shows them what the teacher will be looking for while grading. This can relate back to whenever a teacher is gone for a period of time or is absent for the day and tells the students what is expected of them while the teacher is away. Having expectations and requirements for a project makes sure that the student puts in effort and that the assignment is detailed with the right topics. While students are working on an assignment, and essay, or a project, they do tend to lead their way off topic and start to write about unnecessary details. Having a list or a checklist of things that are expected of each student helps them know what needs to be on it and it is easier to follow.\n \n Most students have said that they prefer checklist and requirements than anything else because it is helpful to check off instructions and make sure that everything that is needed is on the assignment.\n \n Next, having students keep the learning process going during the summer with help their growing minds, but if they are not given the right topics and material then they will be confused and would have not learned a single new thing. With projects, students are suppose to make the assignment talk and discuss a main point of a topic. Teachers usually make projects as specific as possible, if the student was told to do it themselves then it would be easy for them to not go into detail and specifics about anything. In school, most topics have a huge variety of smaller details and information that would not be a main point in assignments and projects. Students would have to follow what the teacher wants to make sure that they do not write down the wrong information. Most of the time, when a teacher designs a project, they usually give a variety of tools and websites to go to if they need more information on something. Those websites and tools will give the specific examples and info on what the topic is based on and it will help the students have a better knowledge of the main point.\n \n Lastly, after focusing on one main topic for a long time, students tend to get bored and not try as hard as they should. Some students have a hard time staying on track while doing something school related on their own, they usually need some guidance to follow and go by. If summer projects were student-designed, the students would not be able to follow what they need to do and would not have any rules to go by. Different students have different ways of learning, some like to do hands on activities or web questsÂ to learn, others just prefer to write down everything that they learn as notes. A teacher-designed project can give different ways of portraying the material. A teacher-designed project will also make students be on time with the assignment. If a teacher assigns a summer project, they will most likely attach when specific things are due at what time, for example: the essay portion will be due in 2 weeks, the rough draft is due in 1 week, the poster with the end result is due the first day of school. Most big projects that take a while to finish will have smaller tasks to finish throughout of period before it is due. Teachers can tell if students are on the right track if they assign things during the process of working on the project.\n \n In other words, having a student designed summer project is not a great idea. If students made the project by themselves, the teacher could become confused while trying to figure out the main topic. Students would not follow any sort of guideline unless a teacher attaches it to the assignment. If the project was not designed by a teacher, then the student making it would not be great with knowing when to put deadlines and they would not be sure with what to put on the project. The summer project will most likely be done much sooner because made it clear when things will be due. If it was made by a student, they will more likely slack off and be lazy with portraying the assignment. A teacher-designed summer project would be the most efficient way to stay on track with deadlines, to know what to talk about or not, and it shows the requirements and expectations that the teacher wants to see.

      "As the school year comes to an end, the school halls are filled with students' conversing about their summer plans, an the joys of the school year being over. However, for many students, school isn't nearly over. Some schools task their students with summer projects to ensure that students keep learning outside of the school year. Ultimately, it is questioned whether the project should be teacher-designed, or student-designed. When a student is given the power to design their own project, it allows the student to grow mentally and help broaden their learning horizons. This allows students to base their project on something that they are heavily interested in, others might even venture beyond what they are already familiar with, and lastly it motivates them to complete their assignment with passion.\n \n It is very often that when a student is told they must complete a project based off a topic that they aren't interested in, their initial thought may be that the project will be boring and difficult. However, when they are allowed to chose their topic, it is very likely that their perspective might change into a more positive point of view. When picking topics for a project, most students are inclined to base it on something that they have a liking for. When I was in middle school, I was part of a program called the\n \n Gifted and Talented, this program was centered on both, group and individual projects. We had been assigned a project in honor of Earth Day and due to my immense love and interest for marine life, I had decided on creating a vessel that would roam the ocean and detect any trash that had been tossed into the water, and collect it. After I had researched where most ocean trash was found, I had decided that this vessel would remain near beaches and ports. If the teacher had designed the project and told us that we had to create something on a specific topic such as, prevention of forest fires, there could have been a chance that I hadn't been as enthused and wouldn't have tried as much.Â Not only did this project help me think outside the box, but it also helped me decide on my future career by allowing me to research more on a topic that I was interested in.\n \n Furthermore, instead of sticking with something familiar, students might try and explore other topics in which they lack knowledge. By learning about different subjects, one is able to broaden their educational horizons, which may come in handy later on in life. I once new a woman who arrived at college \"undecided\". She was unsure of what to major in, and she was later told that she needed to complete a project in a subject of her choosingÂ by the end of the year. Soon after the news, she realized that she needed to decide on a project fast, so she decided she would join her parish during one of their visits to a poor community out of town. She had no knowledge of how to help the people in the community, but she believed that she would be able to both accomplish her project, and make an impact on these people's lives. Her project was then completed after she spent her summer building ramps, cooking meals, and painting murals for that community. Soon after her project was completed, she decided that she would major in Social Services, because making an impact in people's lives and helping them achieve a better life was something she would want to do as a career.\n \n By being able to choose her project, she was able to broaden all of her horizons and grow as a person as well as mentally mature through her experiences. Once again, if there had been restrictions on that project and it was no longer on a topic of her choosing, but instead she had to complete a paper on politics, she could've spent a couple more years undecided, or she could've dropped out of college.\n \n Lastly, when students are allowed to design their own projects, they not only take their time to complete their project, but they pay attention to every last detail, and make sure that everything is done to their liking. It can be said that some of these projects are the result of passion. For example, during my Sophomore year in high school, I was assigned a project based off a genocide of my choosing. OriginallyÂ I thought I would do this project on the Rwandan genocide, but thought better of it since I was already familiar with it. In the end, I decided on the Cambodian Genocide and decided I would be doing a scrapbook for the execution of the project. At first the research was a bit slow since I was unfamiliar with the topic, but as I learned more about the subject, I found a passion for the project I didn't know I had. I began working on the scrapbook everyday after school over the course of a month. By the time the deadline had come, the project had been completed and was ready to be displayed on Genocide Night. In the end, I was able to score a high grade, and even used my research for a project assigned for my art class a year later.\n \n All in all, student designed projects are beneficial for the student as it gives them the opportunity to increase their knowledge in a variety of topics as well as help them mentally mature. When given the choice to infinite possibilities, there is plenty of space for infinite success. Teacher designed projects, more often than not, are usually seen as boring, time consuming tasks, because they are created by someone that doesn't have a students interests in mind. Projects assigned during the school year are solely based on the topic they are learning, or book they are reading in class. However, summer projects should not have that restriction despite the project's purpose of making sure that students are learning. Students should be allowed to take the reigns on their projects, and lead them in the direction that they want to go in. When students are given the freedom of choosing, they are more inclined to learn and retain that information, then when they are forced to learn about things they could care less about.Â",

    essay:
      "Summer is a time for student to have a long deserved break from school. During this time, however, some students become unable to no longer retain their knowledge and have to recover prior knowledge starting the next school year. To compensate, some schools assign summer projects for the students to be proactively accomplishing. Whether it be a project that they get to design or a teacher designs for them. The main argument here is \"what is better\" for the learning experience of the student. A project created and designed by a student over the summer is better than a teacher designed one because the project will be more engaging for the student, the student will have full control, and the student will have easier time learning or their own accord.\n \n A student who designs their own summer project will have a engaging experience with their project. As a student, the ability for a project to be fun to do and still be a good learning experience is number one. Having your own project to do gives you the sense that you know what you're capable of accomplishing. It will be engaging because student will get to interact in their own methods and ways. Learning in this way helps students to retain information and maybe learn about something they may have never thought about. An engaging project made by the students will also give the students a means of commitment to do the project if it is fun to do and is beneficial for them academically. Engagement in a project is the best way for a students to want to be able to drive their passion in learning forward, without the hassle of abiding by the teacher's rules and regulation of the project. Giving students the right to build their own project makes the learning part fun and engaging for the students, which will overall provide them with possibly of better academic achievement and retention.\n \n Students with full control their project will be able to make it a project they will be proud of. Full control means that students will be able to go though the steps of conception, planning/design, making/prototyping, and possibly revision on their own. Giving students the leveraging control, builds the sense that they understand the topic the most and that they should be able to complete the project under their own goals and ideas. This helps to build skills in learning and retaining information taught. With full control, they will also have the necessary time to complete their project on their own without the overlooking burden of a teacher telling them what to do exactly. This removes the unnecessary stress of designing a project to meet someone else's goals and hoping that it will meet their specifications. A student, given this freedom of choice and design, will be able to learn more about something that they enjoy learning about, it makes the overall experience better for them and also builds their design processes to be better efficientÂ and less costly to them. These skills learned from being in full control of a major project can be used in schools and possibly be used later in the workplace or any other setting that puts them under control of a project.\n \n The last argument is that students will have an easier time of learning when they get to make it. Without the teacher being in the way, not only will the student be hopefully, less stressed, but also put them in charge of learning. Being able to self pace yourself, will help to slowly build up information into your mind and retain that information for longer when you may have to use it one day in the near future. Without the regulations of an authoritative teacher, students build projects under their ideas. As long as the project is providing the student with educational content that they will learn from, they will be able to enjoy it, which removes the boring parts of learning about a certain subject and instead, make it fun to learn about and understand. Students building up the knowledge slowly by themselves, will slowly integrate the information into their mind slowly, without overwhelming students with complex research projects or projects dealing with hard to reach goals assigned by the teacher. A student who learns by themselves may be smarter and less worried by the goals of a project than a student who has to follow the rules and regulations word for word from the teacher. Students that get to design the projects themselves will overall have an easier time understanding and learning.\n \n A couple of main arguments that may arise when students get to make their own summer projects is that they may not be learning about what they should be learning about or the project is not regulated enough itself to provide any academic goals. Or, a student may make a project that is overall not fitted for any academic setting. For the most part, if students are just given maybe one or two rules stating that it must be a project that someone can actually obtain information from and that the project is not just a simple little project. Then the need for a teacher to design a project for the students is 3ly gone, since they would only have to follow the simple rule of not making it too easy on themselves and make a project that will help them excel academically.\n \n To wrap up, projects under the design of a student will be better than a teacher designed one because the students are better engaged in their own projects, the students will have full control of their project and everything that goes into it, and the students will have an easier time comprehending/learning at their own pace. Schools that assign summer projects know that the real intent is to help keep the students proactive in their studies over the summer break, and these projects are suppose to help them do so. Student designed projects will be a better option for schools since it gives the students choice in their education. And that profound statement, gives students a better chance at starting off the next school year with information ready to be used.Â",

      "As the school year comes to a close, countless students look forward to spending their days relaxing by the pool, going on vacation, and hanging out with their friends. For some, however, the beginning of summer break also means preparing for the next school year. Summer assignments are common among advanced high school classes, and are equally dreaded by most high school students. Moreover, teacher-designed projects do not spark much interest from those who must complete them. Schools that require students to complete summer projects should allow students to design their assignments because it promotes responsibility, keeps students interested, and provides more opportunities for students in school and in the future.\n \n When completing an assignment over the summer break, students are responsible for setting time aside in order to work and study. A good sense of responsibility is an essential part of designing a project and making sure it gets done. When crafting a project, students are responsible for creating their own ideas and implementing them correctly, in order to create an interactive and challenging assignment. Without good time management skills, a student may fall behind, leaving them with a sub par project, and most likely a disappointed teacher. Allowing a student to take the lead on designing a project will promote the necessary components of learning good time management. As well as time management, a student also learns how to balance priorities. Yes, summer is an amazing opportunity to have fun, but it also provides the means to be better prepared for the school year. When a student decides to prioritize a summer project over a video game or TV program, they set themselves up for future success in the form of a high grade. Focusing on one's priorities teaches them a great deal of responsibility, and can be applied to many different situations in the future. Allowing a student to design their own project teaches them how to 3ly manage their time and understand their priorities, leading them to become more responsible.\n \n When a student learns or studies about something they are interested in, they are able to absorb more information. Letting a student design their own project will assist in a more powerful learning experience. If a student who was interested in trains received a project about frogs, chances are he/she would quickly become disinterested and bored. A student would perform far better on an assignment that their interests can be applied to. A student designed project promotes creativity, as well as sponsoring individuality. Moreover, it is almost impossible for a teacher to design a project that caters towards all the needs and interests of his/her students. A student-lead project would return higher grades and provide a way for a teacher to further understand each of her students, the way they learn, and their personal interests. This allows for a stronger relationship between a teacher and /his/her class, and creates a more beneficial learning environment. The decision to allow students to design their own projects will make for a more impactful, enjoyable, and interesting learning experience.\n \n Lastly, a student-designed project will provide more opportunity for students to expand their network, and discover what they want to study and achieve in the future. When working on a project or assignment that is based off the personal interests of an individual student, they could be inspired to study further into their chosen subject, and provide them with an idea of what they want in the future. A student who studies trains could soon realize that he/she is more interested in planes, and now wants to be a pilot. They could also be influenced to join a school club or get a job that pertains to their chosen subject. The ideas that they create when designing their own project can be applied to their goals for the future. As well as providing ideas for their career and future studies, they will also be able to expand their network of people who have the same aspirations as them. Designing a project allows for one to work with many different people, such as a partner or group, and offers the means to build new relationships and acquaintances. The idea of a student-designed summer project is more 3 in expanding a student's knowledge of personal goals, and provides an environment with many opportunities to meet new people and discover new ideas.\n \n In conclusion, the benefits of a student-designed project are far greater than those of a teacher-designed project. Students learn new skills, such as responsibility and time management. They are also provided with opportunity to expand their knowledge, discover their interests, and discover themselves as an individual. The people they meet and work with throughout designing and completing a summer project will benefit them in school, further studies, and possibly even the work force. The idea of a student-designed project proves itself to be a more beneficial, rewarding, and fun experience.Â  Â Â Â Â",

    essay:
      "Many schools across the country require students to complete summer assignments to assure that they continue their pursuit of knowledge even without a teacher present. But should these assignments be designed by the teacher or should they be designed by the student? If a student were given freedom with their project, it would be a lot more enjoyable rather than if a teacher put strict conditions on it. But a lack of strictness would mean that students are less likely to complete their project and they wouldn'tÂ know when the work they have done is enough. Teachers should put that restriction on the student and give them a specific assignment to ensure that the appropriate amount of work gets done.\n \n Students are less likely to complete a project that they have freedom on and if they do complete it, the quality would suffer greatly compared to if a teacher gave them a prompt or a specific task to accomplish. The point of a summer assignment is to prevent to student from losing knowledge or getting rusty because of a break. Although the point of the summer break is to let students relax until the next year starts, it's still important that they keep their studies up. Assignments shouldn'Â be student-designed because that would allow too much leisure and when school comes around, most students would not have it done. For example, I had two summer assignments last summer. One was for English and one was for Math. For the English one, the assignment was to read any book of my choosing and write a review about it. This assignment had very unclear instructions and I, the student, was supposed to add my own twist to it and complete the assignment however I wanted to. I started on the assignment, but never finished it because I didn't have the motive since there was no specific prompt to answer to, so I wrote a couple of sentences and called it quits. But for the Math assignment, I had a packet to complete of practice problems. The finish was in sight and crystal clear. I did it throughout the summer and finished it by August. The reassurance I felt that once I did a specific amount of work and followed the teacher's directions, I would be done is what encouraged me to finish. The English assignment was unclear and I didn't know how much to complete to make sure that I was on track for next year.\n \n Summer assignments are important for a student and the reason to have them teacher-designed is to give the student reassurance and to make sure the student doesn't do too much work over what's supposed to be a break, yet it keeps them on track. If an assignment is student-designed then the student will do one of three things: overwork themselves, not fully apply their capabilities, or not do the work at all. For these reasons, summer assignments should all be teacher-designed.",

      'Some schools that require students to complete summer projects to assure kids continue to learn over break is a smart idea. Yet, the question "Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student- designed?" Can determine if a student will enjoy and do the work that they are assigned. These projects should be student-designed because this will cause a higher percent of students to do the work, while enjoying the experience, students can learn about something that they want, and teachers will be able to learn about the new students coming to their class.\n \n There is always a problem with kids not doing their assigned work. Starting off the year with a incomplete project could ruin the year for some. If students were allowed to design the project, they would be choosing topics that they are likely to complete, and ones that they can enjoy. There is a direct correlation with kids who enjoy the topic they are learning about and completion rate of projects. Student-designed projects may lead to a higher percent of kids doing their work and less kids pushing off projects till the last minute. This can assure that kids will be learning the matirial over summer break.\n \n Projects don\'t always have to be strictly information that we cover in school, sometimes it is good to learn about something that interests the individual. With student-designed projects, students will have the freedom to chose what they want to learn about. Giving this opportunity to students will allow them to show their interests to teachers and their peers. Having kids focus on something they find interesting, increases their drive to learn new information, which will help them throughout the upcoming school year.\n \n Student-designed projects will not only benefit students, teachers will learn about new students as the school year starts. Having teachers learn about students can help build important teacher-student relationships. Teacher-student relationships are important to develop throughout the year, so students feel they have a safe place to go if they need help or if they have had a bad day. Many students tend to have hard times learning from teachers they dont respect, or like. Projects that are student-designed will increase the trust kids have in their teachers, as well as teachers about new students.\n \n While some teachers and school officials may not be in favor of student-designed projects because it could be hard to grade if the teacher does not know the topic being presented. Many people would argue that students should not be the only people learning new things. Teachers should be able to learn about topics the students are interested in to better the way they interact with students. Although, teachers might not be experts on these topics, grade should not be on the information, rather on the way the student presents the information and how they researched each topic.\n \n While the answer to teacher-designed projects or student-designed projects can be up for debate their are many reason to why a student-designed project are better than teacher-designed project. The level of completion, student interest, and allowing for better teacher-student relationship are all very important to assure that students will continue to learn over break.Â',

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. This helps them to keep their brain running. I believe that the students should get to design what project they want to do. Choosing their project will guarantee that they are focused while working on it, they will choose a topic that interests them, and their grade will result at a higher score.\n \n Allowing students to choose their projects will help keep them focused on it. For example, if a student likes things related to writing, they will enjoy working on it. They will give it all their effort and time. It also allows them to focus more on the topic itself. Being home will let also let them be comfortable working on their projects. They will not be distracted by any classmates. They will feel less pressured by their teachers to get things done. They will be able to pace themselves. And their hard work will be reflected in their projects.\n \n Students tend to get exited about a topic they are interested in. Giving them the freedom to do so will result in a better researched project. They will also be interested in similar things, so they will continue to research without them being told to do so. The quality of their project will be reflected by their interest in the topic they choose.\n \n Some people may believe that getting their research project assigned by a teacher is better. I disagree with this statement. Students will feel the pressure of getting the assignment done because a teacher told them to do so. Some may even do the project last minute because they were not interested in the topic. Or maybe they were not comfortable working on it. Their efforts to work on the project will be decreased, resulting in a much lower grade. If a student chooses the topic they want to work on, and the time they dedicate to working on it, they will get a higher score. It will assure that the students continue to learn during their break.\n \n In conclusion, a student-designed project will ensure they continue to learn over the break. They will get to enjoy their break and learn at the same time. A teacher-designed project will make them lose interest and effort. What would you prefer?Â",

    essay:
      "Imagine you just finished your sophomore year of high school. Summer has finally arrived! The whole Summer is yours for you to do anything and everything you want to do... except for your Summer assignment. In one class, your teacher has assigned you to run a specific research project that encompasses all the main ideas of the subject. In another class, the teacher has given you the assignment of designing and completing your own project. You sit down and think. Which one of these projects will teach me the subject better? Summer project assignments should be designed by the teacher of the course's project since it would avoid students designing projects that are not challenging enough, teachers know the subject better, and they are trained to give the right assignments for 3 teaching.\n \n First and foremost, high school students are known to avoid the heavier workload if given the choice of a lighter one, even if the heavier workload will benefit them in the long run. For example, I've had the experience of having a history class assign more work one year, and the next year's history class assign less. In the class with more projects and work given, I learned the material more thoroughly and can still apply the material I learned to other situations. On the other hand, I can't remember much of the material from the class that gave me less work and projects. Though I enjoyed the lighter class, I learned that more work is equivalent to a better understanding of the subject. This, therefore, means that students, with their preference for less work, would not benefit from designing their own project since they'd simply design a light and extremely easy project.\n \n Another reason why teachers should design Summer projects is that they know the subject they teach better than the students they are assigning the project to. Teachers, apart from having learned and gone through the same classes as the students they teach, have also gone to college and studied the subject in a lot more depth for years. They simply know more than the student and know what projects helped them, as students, learn the material. A chemistry teacher, for example, is going to know what project to give to students in order for the student to learn chemistry since the students haven't even taken the class yet. Students do not know what projects will teach them 3ly.\n \n Additionally, teachers have gone through years of schooling and college to get to the position they are in, as well as probably having years of teaching experience. They have been trained to teach students 3ly and know what methods of teaching work best. This also means that teachers know which projects and what approach to projects are best for students. In my science class one year I had the option of designing and running my own experiment. I chose the easiest option and ended up doing badly since there were no instructions or guidelines for the experiment. I did learn from my mistakes and having to teach myself the subjects related to the experiment, but the experiment was mostly a fiasco. I learned the subjects a lot better when my teacher gave us a project that had clear intentions and guidelines that guided us to the main lesson we were being taught rather than just a project of doing whatever thrown at us. Teacher usually knows best.\n \n After a few moments of thinking, you come to the conclusion that teacher-designed projects teach you better and more 3ly. Yes, you as a student do know how you yourself learn better than a teacher knows how you specifically learn. Yes, students can also learn from the process and mistakes of designing a project, but the truth is that the likelihood of at least the majority of students putting the effort into their project to put these ideas into account is very low. Teachers know how to teach and what projects to give to students to 3ly teach. Now, you sit down and start your projects.",

      "Over the summer, students forget a lot of what they learned during the previous year; some even have trouble writing after summer break. This is why some schools have projects over the summer, such as summer reading. These projects should be designed by teachers because the teachers know how to incorporate important aspects of the course that they are teaching into a project, and because the students don't know the material in the course as well as the teachers do.\n \n Teachers know how to introduce their students to new material, or prepare them to be introduced to new material; they are professionals at it. Many teachers have years of experience, or at the very least, they can go to another teacher in their department for help creating an idea for a project. Therefore, they should be able to curate a project that allows their upcoming students to be prepared for their class. While they may not be teaching new material with these projects, they are preparing their students for the rest of the year.\n \n Some may argue that students should create ideas for projects for their fellow students because they themselves are students, and know what would have helped them. However, their teachers know the material better, and have a better understanding of what they can do to ensure the success of their students. Many students don't even remember what they learned at the beginning of the year. If they don't remember what they learned at the beginning of the school year, they can't come up with ideas for a project to introduce them to that material. Students don't want to do homework during the summer. If they were tasked with coming up with a project that introduces upcoming students to the material, they may just create a project that is easy but does not introduce the material well, in order to have less work to do over the summer.\n \n Teachers should design summer projects for their students, because they know what they are teaching and how to incorporate the meaningful ideas from their class into a project, and because they know their curriculum better than their students do.

      "Summer projects, although tidious and time consuming, are important. They are given to students by teachers to allow the students to retain the knowlege they have previously learned. They might also be given to teach the students new concepts before they enter the new school year. This allows teachers to teach a new concept at a faster pace since the students already taught it to themselves over the break. These project are very common in higher level classes because they require a higher level of understanding. These projects should be student-designed. I think that student-designed projects are a more efficient way for students to learn the required material over the summer break. It gives the students the flexibility that teacher-designed projects don't give. This is because students can design the project to their specific learning style and schedule and it allows the students to explore their creative side.\n \n If students design their own projects they have the ability to cater to their own learning needs. Some students are visual learners. Some benefit from repitition. Each student is vastly different from next. For example, if someone knew that they were a visual learner, they could draw pictures about the topic that they are learning about. They could illustrate a storyboard about a major war or make a cartoon about how to solve a math problem. They would not benefit from making flashcards and memorizing words because their brain deems those tactics boring. When someone's brain recognizes something as fun and enjoyable, it is more awake and ready to work. This also allows the students who don't know the best way that their brain retains information to explore and find what works best for them. This could help students in the long run by making them aware of what tactics they can use to study for tests.\n \n Students, especially high school and college level ones, usually have extremely full schedules. On the days they don't have extracurricular activities, they have work or home responsibilities. The range of what keeps a student busy is enormous. From a part-time job to band practice, students are overwhelmed with endless responsibilies. Allowing students to design their own summer projects gives them the ability to set their own work load. This takes some of the pressure off and still gives them the time to focus on other things in their lives. If a student only has two hours in their day to do school work, they won't design a project that requires them to research a topic for three hours a day and then write about it for two more hours. They will make something that allows them to research a quick topic and write a short paragraph so they can get in their eight hours of sleep.\n \n Schools focus on challenging their students academically and they champion the students who thrive in the athletic department. Schools usually fail to give any attention to the students who excel in being creative and having problem solving skills. Student-designed school projects would allow those students to thrive in making up a unique and efficient way to learn a new concept. It would also be beneficial to the students who struggle in that area, allowing them to practice and explore new ideas. As a student who stuggles in being original and creative, I would be forced to research new ways of learning. It would make me practice thinking outside of the box which is an important skill that can be applied outside of a school setting and in the workplace.\n \n Although student-designed projects allow students to make projects to their specific learning style and schedule and allows the students to explore their creative side, there are also things that teacher-designed projects are more efficient at. Teacher-designed projects make sure that what is needed to be learned, is actually learned. If a student designs their own project based on a broad topic, they may miss key terms or ideas that are essential to understanding the whole topic. When a project is guided by the teacher's instructions, students are less likely to be confused. There is also the chance that a student designs a project so they do not have to do any work. They can make one that requires them to only write their name on a piece of paper. Most projects are already teacher-designed and not many people have trouble understanding them. If students were to start designing their own projects it may leave students confused and unprepared for their class when the school year starts.\n \n I think that teacher-designed projects can be beneficial, but not to every student. Allowing the students to make their own projects makes certain that every student will learn the material in their own style and at their own pace. When teachers design projects, many students don't understand and are left behind. Even though some students may design a project that is incredibly simple, not all students want self-sabatoge like that. Most students understand that summer work can set them up for success during the school year. I think that the pros outweigh the cons on allowing students to design their own summer projects. Student-designed projects allow students to learn by their own style, learn at their own pace, and explore and implement their creative ideas.Â",

    essay:
      "When was the last time you have been assigned a project over summer break? My last summer project was this past summer. It was a history project that took me days to complete. All I remember was dreading to work on the project because I already knew the information that it was about. Instead of the summer project being only a review, it should have been both a review and new information. Students get bored learning the same thing over and over again. They need something to help them for the upcoming year as they enter a new class. Therefore, summer projects should be student-designed because students would learn better, use their creative ability, and be more motivated to complete the project.\n \n Summer projects should not be about keeping the student busy. They should be about preparing the student for the new class along with helping the student retain past information. If the projects were student-designed, then students would be more likely to learn better. When I was in tenth grade, our task was to create our own project based off a certain number of topics that were given to us. I chose to do my project about World War Two. Since I chose something that I am interested in, I learned a lot of new information and information that I already knew. If I was assigned a project about old civilizations, then I probably wouldn't have learned as well as I did. This is a prime example showing how a student-designed project will help a student learn better.\n \n Creativity is something that is difficult to express for students. There are very little opportunities to express who you really are in school. Every small chance that a student gets to show their personality is an opportunity. This is another reason why summer projects should be student-designed. Furthermore, if a summer project was student-designed, then that student will have a ton of opportunities to create something that represents them. For example, an artsy student might pick a project that involves drawing or painting. An athletic student might pick a project that involves a challenge. Finally, a studious student might do a project that has a lot of work. The possibilities are endless. Having each and every student express who they are can inspire many in and out of school. This is only the second reason why summer projects should be student-designed.\n \n The last reason summer projects should be student-designed is because the students would be more motivated to complete the project. Summer is the only time that students have a long-tern break. They don't think about school or learning too often. The last thing they want to think about is another project that their teacher assigned to them. Their motivation to complete this project is very low. The only way to help motivate students would be to allow the project to be student-designed. It needs to be a project that they will enjoy doing. It can't be just another project that the teacher assigns just because why not. Last year, in chemistry, I was allowed to pick my project for my end of year science research project. I picked a topic that I wanted to see the outcome of. Throughout the entire project, I was motivated to complete it. This is because I chose what I wanted to do. Some people might say that a student can be motivated to complete a project even if it is teacher-designed. The counter to this is that when a student designs a project that they are interested in, the likelihood for that student to complete the project increases greatly. This is because they know what they want to learn about and what is interesting for them. Every little bit of motivation can help a student learn more than they thought.\n \n As you can see, student-designed projects are way better than boring teacher-designed projects. These were only just a few reasons why student-designed projects are better. Now that you know which one is better, I encourage all people to advocate around their community to make this a reality. Every student should be able to do a project on what they want to learn about. If we all used our voice to express our thoughts, then our planet would be a much better place in and outside of school.",

    essay:
      "Some schools are required to assign assignments to their students to do a summer project during their summer break, but I believe that students should'nt be required to have summer projects. And I also believe that student should have a student-designed say in this because it's their choice based on if they would rather have summer assignments or not. I get it teachers want students to have summer assignments so that they're still learning but if students have assignments during their time off is that even summer break if students still have to do work during thier break.\n \n One reason why I believe that students should'nt have summer projects is because it is summer and student just want to enjoy their break and have fun. Student should have a say in this is because it's their choice if they would like to do summer projects or just enjoy and relax. I think most student would rather pick having fun and relaxing over summer projects, because for nine months students are going at least to 7 classes for nine months and learning new things, also doing projects, homework, classwork and more. If students had to have a vote for summer assignments or having a summer break without any summer projects, the majority of the students would pick summer break without any summer projects.\n \n Another reason why I believe students should design summer projects is because some students might get overwhelmed and very stressed out. School can be really stressful especially if you're failing some of your classes and getting a lot of work. Another reason why I think school is stressful is because you have seven classes and most teachers asign assignments to their students, this can be stressful for students because they have a lot of work to finish and some assignment are due the next or next class and they have to think about their other class assignments. Most students have a job and they won't have time to their summer assignment or they either went to vaction because summer time is about relaxing and having no worries, it should be a stress free summer. Summer is a time to enjoy while there is no school or no work assignments, summer break is a time to spend time with family and go to fun places and explore new things and places, not just doing school work while it is summer break.\n \n The final reason why I believe that student should have a say in summer project is because students should have a good time off. Students should'nt have summer projects because some students might go to summer school and have to do more work on top of summer projects, while they're doing summer school work , it could lead to some students not doing the summer project because summer school is too much stress for them. When student are in school they aren't really going on vaction or they aren't going out as much having fun because of school. The majority of the student don't want to miss school because if they miss school for a day it can back up them up from learning and not knowing anything that is going on in class. And summer break is about going out on vaction and exploring new things and adventure's, also not having to worry what time they have to be home for school or doing any assignment because it is summer break they should be able to enjoy it until school starts again. The majority of students don't go out on school day or during the weekends because they're either busy, working or just don't have time, that's why we have summer break so that we can relax and have fun and not worry about summer assignments.\n \n In conclusion these are the three main reasons as to why I believe that students should be students should not be assigned summer projects , so that they can enjoy their summer vaction off and being stress free until school starts again, I also believe that all students and staff should have off so that they all get a break and time off to relax and have family time.Â",

    essay:
      "For most, summer is filled with unwinding from the stresses of school, traveling to new places, and learning new skills. This break is given to students to relax and reflect on all of their hard work. Summer allows students to find activities that they are passionate about. Summer assignments should be student-designed because this allows students to determine the extent and length, the topic, and the platform the project will take place on. This break in between moving onto the next level of education is meant for students to distress and enjoy life outside of school. Surely, making the summer projects more student-based allows for scholars to continue to learn, while also allowing students to enjoy time off.\n \n An important part of growing as a person and figuring out what career path to go down in the future is exploring possible interests. This break from the school year allows for students to do this outside of school, as well as time given to relax. If the length of the projects assigned over the summer are chosen by teachers, the students could end up with a big work load which takes away from their opportunities. Many students get jobs over the summer to gain work experience before furthering their education after high school. Not only does this help them build their transcript and resume before moving onto a new chapter in life, but it also allows them to figure out what they like do versus what they do not like to do. Students who are overwhelmed with summer projects are more inclined to not get a job or participate in the things they like to do, which defeats the purpose of the break.\n \n Another positive outcome of student-designed projects is students can have a say in what they want to research. If the students are allowed to pick the topic of their projects that have to do with the associated class, they are more likely to have better work and learn more. Again, this break is given to scholars to allow them to enjoy life outside of school. By giving students no say in the topic they are furthering their learning on, they are less inclined to do their best work or even any work at all. Having students pick the topic of their summer assignments would surely make the projects more enjoyable and easier for the students to complete.\n \n Finally, the last component that students should be able to determine for their summer projects is the platform they use to complete the project. Hands-on students prefer to do projects on a poster board, while more tech-savvy students would prefer to use Google slides or Prezi to present their work. Giving students a say in the way they are able to complete their project makes it a lot more enjoyable for them, essentially making it easier to complete. There are many different types of learners like people who prefer to visualize the topic they are learning about or people who would rather hear more on the topic. More visual learners may have better time comprehending the subject of the project if they can add visuals to the projects by hand. Audible learners may want to listen to videos regarding the topic and film a podcast discussing their work to better process the research they have done.\n \n Student-designed projects allow for better learning and understanding of the topic, while still allowing students to enjoy their time off from school. Although, student should have a say in the subject, length, and platform of their summer projects, teachers should also set boundaries for these projects. It would be pointless for students to study a topic not relating to the class at all. Teachers could provide students with a list of subjects to research that they can pick from. There should also be guidelines that pertain to the length of the project because it is unfair if some students work really hard on the summer projects, yet others slack off for the same grade. However, the students should have some say in the amount of work they chose to do. Students should also be given multiple platforms to choose from, but not completely free range. The risk with giving students a free range of platforms is students could use platforms that teachers are not familiar with. Students should be given the choice of the topic, length, and platform concerning their summer assignments with teacher guidelines. It is important to keep students learning, while also letting them participate in the things they are passionate about.",

      "Every student loves summer vacation. They love Staying home relaxing, going out with friends, swimming at the pool, and so much more! What students do not like during summer vacation though is school related projects.\n \n Students are giving projects during the summer to make sure they continueÂ learning and improve their education. That is not always fun, especially for students when they have summer break.\n \n Everyone loves to relax and not do anything. That is what summer vacation is for, it allows people, especially students to have some quality time off. Students do not always do their homework, from personal experience that is true. That is why they have less chance of doing projects during the summer when they can be relaxing instead. If they are giving the option to select their own projects they desire, they will more likely finish the project and have fun while doing it.\n \n That allows students to stay interested in a certain topic they love to learn about. This makes projects during break way more fun, and it increases the chances of students doing the projects. From personal experience, learning about topics I am passionate about or interested in, makes it way more fun to research and learn about.\n \n People might disagree that students do not don't care about their projects, or that they won't do it, regardless what topic it is about. That is false, humans are curios creatures, learning is part of the everyday life for everyone. Learning is fun and it helps individuals develop as a person. Students are more likely to work on projects that is important to them, topics that they love learning about.\n \n Everyone enjoys time off, but there is times when everyone has to do work. During summer break, students have time for both. Summer projects will help keep their minds ready and assure they learn during break, while they also have time to relax. Students will increase their effort in projects if the topic is more interesting for them.\n \n They should have the choice to choose what projects they want to do on their summer break.",

      "Once a year Summer break comes around, the time of year every student is looking forwards too from the moment it end till the minute it begins. Yet some schools believe that their students need to continue to study, and learn over this long break. Summer is a time that has always been advertised as a time to go on vacation and put down all the books for a series of weeks to have fun. Yet for some students this isn't an option some teachers assign rigorous assignments for students to complete which can completely control and ruin theirÂ time off. By having students plan their own summer assignments, students can still excel and be ready for school when they return, and have that ideal Summer that isn't behind a book or keyboard.\n \n Giving students the opportunity to create, and design their own Summer work opens endless opportunities and can actually inspire learning new things inside and outside of the standard curriculum. By having majority of students elect a certain amount of peers to create these assignments for them, which would give a students insight on how much work we should be given, and how flexible it should be. Teachers still will have to approve of the work created and revise if, and as needed to make sure it is 2 and follows the curriculum to prepare students. With all of this said and done, many arguments can arise about how elected students could give minimalist work because they feel pressured by friends and other peers to make it easy, which is all more reasons teachers should still oversee the process, and decide if it is fair or not.\n \n If schools eventually decide to let students design, and assign their own Summer homework this could still come with much skepticism, being a new concept means it could come with some minor flaws to be discovered. Yet with the proper determination and open willingness to change both students and teachers can benefit and be ready for the new school year when they return with the newly founded knowledge they need to succeed in their new year, while having their ideal vacations and spending time with their family instead of being behind a book or keyboard.",

      "One time in the 5th grade me and my classmates were given an assignment that we were told to design by ourselves. We were told to choose any format to present our projects and allowed to present it on any topic as long as it related to science. As the deadline for the project drew near many students talked about how they had not completed the project because they lacked direction. As a result many students received bad grades and teachers struggled to grade individual projects on the same scale due to varying formats and topics. Many schools are questioning whether summer assignments should be designed by students or teachers. Mandatory summer projects shouldÂ be designed by teachers to guarantee that students have a clear understanding of requirements and continue to learn over the break.\n \n Educators best understand the curriculum students need to keep up with. In the majority of schools different departments are run by teachers working together to design the courses. If summer projects are designed by the same teachers then schools can ensure that the assignments will help students prepare for upcoming classes.\n \n Additionally, these projects can give a general idea of how the class will be taught and how difficult the course will be. This way students can get a head start on the material and have a complete understanding of what will be required.\n \n When designing tasks teachers can ensure that students are given enough work to learn. Over the summer of my freshman year I was given a project where students were allowed to choose which book they read and write a report on it. Many students chose short novels and finished their assignments in only a day. This caused any potential learning to be lost as students mostly forgot about the assignment after completing it. Projects designed by teachers can ensure that students do enough work over their break to continue learning outside of school and that the work matches the level of the class.\n \n Teachers can give additional support and instruction on assignments they designed. When projects are created by students teachers may struggle to help them with questions they may have. In the English department at my school teachers all work together to design large projects so that anyone in the department can answer questions and help students. This leads to a better understanding among students but still allows them to create unique and individual products that promote growth.\n \n Projects assigned over long breaks should be designed by teachers because teachers can better understand the curriculum, ensure that students learn, and provide additional support on assignments. In the future more assignments could be created that allow students to get a glimpse at upcoming material. Long breaks that often cause students to lose touch with the rhythm of school can be turned into opportunities to prepare. We should all encourage the furthering of our education by demanding that schools around us help students learn over break and require teachers to design summer projects for students.Â  Â Â Â",

    essay:
      "During the summer, students across the world are given a break from school and the stress it entails. Although I believe summer break is an important thing for students, it can also be harmful educationally. This is because when students take extended breaks from their regular education, they often tend to forget things regarding their previous curriculum, and this break can also make it emotionally harder for students to return to school at the end of their summer break. Schools who require their students to complete summer projects have proved higher scores in student testing and graduation rates. I believe that these projects should be teacher-designed rather than student-designed. This is because teacher-designed summer projects would be more specific to curriculum, more educational, and more 3 regarding preparation for the start of the school year, opposed to student-designed projects.\n \n To begin, I believe that teacher-designed projects would be more specific to curriculum opposed to student-designed projects. This is because teachers have further knowlege of upcomming curriculum while students do not. Therefore, the teacher-designed projects would be more hlepful in preparing a student for his or her upcoming classes. For example, if a teacher were to design a history project for a rising senior taking government for their next history class, the project would likely be based on a summary or unit in the students upocoming class. This project would be a simple way of preparing this student for their upcoming class and the curriculum it involves. If the student had designed the project themself, it may be on the wrong materal or may not be focused on important information they'll need during their upcoming school year. Although it is important to gain a basis of all knowledge, the more specific infomation a teacher would be able to demonstrate would be far more 3 and helpful for a student in the long run.\n \n Secondly, I believe that teacher-designed projects would be far more educational than student-designed projects during the summer. This is because teachers have previously attended college and have earned degrees to professionally provide education to students. As experts in this field, a teacher would likely include more useful and informative information on a summer project, thus making the project far more 3. If a student were to design a project this could result in an activity that is not nearly as educational, helpful, and ultimately worth-while. If there are more educational benefits included in summer projects it can successfully provide an oppurtunity for students to learn and grow, while a student-designed project may lack this needed education which could result in a class being too challenging, stressful, and this student having an ultimately harder school life.\n \n Lastly, I strongly believe that teacher-designed projects would be far more 3 regarding preparation for the start of a students school year. Teachers are aware of the details included in certain classes, and they have knowlege of a lot more information about these courses than a student would. Although a student may 3ly design a summer project based on previoulsy taken classes, I believe education can only be expanded through gaining more knowledge regarding future classes, and these projects would likely be more 3 if they were focused more toward a student's upcoming schooling rather than their previous education. This would allow the student to be 3ly prepared and ready for the new school year, and possibly more prepared for some challenging courses they may end up taking in thier future, whether that is in grade school or earning a more advance degree. Not only would the teacher-designed project prepare them further, but it could also 3ly make their next school year less stressful and more comprehendable. The teacher-designed project would not only prepare them for future education, but it could also prepare them for real-world struggles. For example, if a teacher-designed project ends up being challenging and stressful for a student, it will act as many real-life struggles. If this student were able to put hard work into completing this project, not only will they be further prepared educationally, but it could have the ability of showing them that life has challenges that may seem difficult but are never impossible.\n \n As time passes and problems are thrown at us, it seems as though young people are the one's with problem-solving ideas, and although I strongly stand by the idea of children and young people progressing our world, it is important that these students inquire the proper education to do so. That is why I believe that teacher-designed summer projects would be immensely more 3 than student-designed projects during the summer. If students are able to complete these teacher-designed summer projects it could make their schooling more 3, thus producing future societal contributors. These teacher-designed projects could be a driving force in creating a problem solving adult who in the longrun could change the future of our fast-paced world and its many obstacles.",

      "Summer projects are often assigned to students to ensure learning continues over the summer. They help keep students' hands moving and gears turning. Projects are typically designed by teachers, however, when made by students the work load is easier to handle and is best fitted to each, individual student. Teachers can't always make classwork fun and engaging. By having a student make their own project, it takes the work load off the teacher and gives the student work they will enjoy doing. Additionally, most projects made by teachers have the same structure, therefore, it would be easier for students to cheat. Lack of supervision and a surplus of free time can lead to unwantedÂ collaborations.\n \n Everyone knows students dislike school, It has loud teachers and bone numbing A/C. Students are constantly falling asleep in class, not listening, and avoiding work. Being assigned a project over their sunny Summer break must be a bummer, right? That's what most people think, but assigning work that students have more liberty over can give them the upper-hand. They can choose a project that they have the supplies for, set it so it doesn't take much effort or time, and not to mention, they can be creative! They get an opportunity to explore something they're passionate about. And when a student is passionate about something, they make sure everyone knows.\n \n Projects take up time. In the Summer, time is in excess. Giving out a project makes sure they always have something to do. Students loose a lot over their break, they come back to school perplexed at a simple math problem. Take Generic_Name into example, she's an A-B student but every summer she looses what she learned that school year and it takes a few weeks for her to get back on track. Usually her first report card has C's and even D's. But one summer in 10th grade she was assigned two projects and her first report card in 11th grade had ALL A's! She was way ahead of the class and felt more confident when completing her assignments. Practice is key to gaining knowledge. With students tongue tied, Summer projects help turn their question marks into exclamation points!\n \n The teacher may also get a better understanding of his/her students. They get to see what they like, what inspires them, what makes them mad, what makes them said or what they have strong opinions on. It makes it easier to relate to a generation that seems illegible on the exterior. Kids can be confusing, especially with the professional relationship of teachers and students. They can't be as personal with their students, even then, there's too many to even try!\n \n Student-made projects give teachers an easy window into their individuality. Future projects may also improve and become better suited to the audience. Complaints about the complexity or disappointment of their assignment will disappear. And, yet again, the work load that is removed. No more stressing about what they should learn, just some simple guidelines and grading rubric. They could even make their own!\n \n Teachers put a lot of effort into their job, some would say the most out of any job. Their own money and heart is put into their work. They buy students supplies and are even are taught as if they were the teacher's own! There will always be that one kid that wants to show off and ends up biting off more than he can chew. Teachers give great structure by making it themselves. Projects are also easier to grade because they would all have the same structure. Summer projects can be a great way to keep minds growing over that long break, it just depends on the situation as to who should create the project.",

      "Almost everyone who attended school can attest to how boring and tedious summer work can be. Whether it's assigned reading or a project, students often dislike having schoolwork cut into their summertime. However, it is a necessary evil, and although there are compelling arguments for self-directed learning and independent study, the fact remains that it's the teacher's job to know how to help their students learn. Summer work should be designed via a partnership of students and teachers, so that students can learn in ways that interest them and help them grow, and teachers can ensure that the material is taught correctly.\n \n While the intervention of teachers in this process may seem to be too controlling or unnecessary, the fact remains that they have gone through a lengthy process to ensure that they are trained to teach the material as 3ly as possible. They go through an extensive process involving obtaining at least a bachelor's degree as an undergraduate student (and in many cases going even further and pursuing post-graduate studies), spending time as a student teacher, obtaining other certifications, and taking part in continuing teacher training throughout their careers. The experience and education that teachers have is simply too much to ignore when considering the development of a student's summer project or curriculum.\n \n Another factor to consider when advocating for students developing their own projects or curriculum is that all students are different. Some may not design their own work with their own best educational interests in mind, and others may not do as well learning via a highly structured summer project or curriculum. Yes, some students are very bright or passionate and will diligently undertake projects and studies on their own, but that is not true for all students. Everyone learns differently, and many people thrive in situations where they have specific guidelines and rules to follow or goals to meet. The wide range of learning and personality types in schools is a major reason why summer projects and curricula should be a collaborative effort between students and teachers. No two students learn the same, so why should they be forced to do the same work?\n \n Although there are many good reasons for students doing projects that were designed by a teacher, it is also important to consider the fact that teachers may simply be out of touch with how their students wish to learn. Student-designed work can be incredibly fulfilling upon completion; the student will have identified an area of study they enjoy, pursued and researched it, and hopefully will have reached a fulfilling conclusion through a project, experiment, or assignment. However, all of this can be accomplished to its fullest potential with the help of an adult. A trusted mentor (such as a teacher), can be an invaluable resource to a young person undertaking a major project on their own.\n \n Much of education deals with absolutes. Standardized testing, graduation requirements, etc., etc. One can go on and on describing all of the things that individuals must do to conform with the school system. All of this is necessary to ensure that all students find success. However, summer work is a wonderful opportunity for a student's individuality to shine through, and with the help of a teacher, they can design work that will be fulfilling and extremely educational.",

I've done this project similar to the summer project, but mine wasn't in the summer, this was an annual thing where students share their ideas or passion in the criteria of being a creative and critical thinking, communication, etc. The project was a student based work, this benefited everyone to become unique and show your ideas to be a being collaborator, or communicator. Their were many different projects and many different voices spread across the school, it made me to feel that being different is great and striving for the passion is a key to owning success. I had fun doing this project, it gave me more freedom, it made me connect to more people who has same passion and ideas as I did. If the summer project was a student design project, it can help people spread their passion.\n \n From the project, there was not a lot of commitmentÂ for sharing ideas. ProcrastinationÂ happens a lot, student can pretend to work on it because they are afraid that it will take to long, or worked on it poorly just for a good grade. Also, how would the grading system work on the summer project, how can a teacher grade on a student of their ideas. Moreover, a teacher designed project would set standards of the project and can help students complete it, and it can be easy to know the rules of making the project. When I was preparing my project, I saw many student did their work but with low quality work, their wasn't a lot ofÂ encouragementÂ to the students project. There should be requirements on the summer project, to make rules that are not strict, but can set and help students to regulate their project.\n \n In conclusion, student designed project should be the main design, it helps student bring out their creative side and share ideas. Although, this can lead into lazy work, to no work at all, or no encouragement among students. Setting regulations and rules toward the project, can help to set up thier ideas or passion to share.Â",

    essay:
      "When it's summer it basically means freedom for all kids. But there are some schools who do give their kids summer projects for them to do so they still lean during their break and they are all teacher designed. Students should be able to design their own projects because they can make time to work and pick their own deadlines, make their own instructions for them to understand, and how they learn by themselves.\n \n Students should be able to make time for their projects and pick their own deadlines. When you are assigned a project at school; the teacher picks the time for you to be able to work on your project. But there are times were these picked times affect students other life. Some may already have plans to do something whether it's going on a trip or just hanging out with friends, and family. And it's sorta ruined because now they have to stress on finishing a project during their plans. And a thing to avoid students from getting is stress. During the school year kids already have enough stress to deal with because they are given a lot work to do and only have a certain amount of time to finish their assignments. Lets not have students stress during their long break which they deserve. By allowing them to pick their time to work, and picking their deadlines; it'll eliminate the stress, and they can have their fun without it getting ruined.\n \n Teacher when they assign projects; they get to make the instructions on how to do the assignment. Sometimes the instructions are clear for some students, but for the others it isn't. Students are always told to ask their teachers if they have any questions or don't understand the assignment. But for some students, asking questions and trying to understand what to do still isn't clear for them, and they go ahead and try to figure it out themselves doing more work and once again giving them stress; only to find out they did it wrong. By allowing them to make their own instructions, it'll be clear for them to understand and they won't have to go through a lot of hard work to figure out what to do. Students already know what they need to know, and by making them do something they don't know at all, won't help them at all in the future. And they don't want to learn something they didn't know during the school year and now they have to learn it during there break.\n \n A teachers goal is to teach their students as well as possible, and hope that what they taught their student; they continue to still use it in their future. Allowing students to make their own assignments can show what they have learned from their teachers. It can help the teachers show what they need to teach future students and it shows that they are doing a good job to students education. And it'll show how well they can work on their own with the knowledge they have acquired, and with their creative mind they can come up with amazing things.. Teachers want to see one of their students as a leader; and by giving them the chance to make their own projects, is giving the current leader hope that their student can carry the touch for others. And during the summer they can learn more on their own which is what the teachers want: and show huge improvements to their learning.\n \n Students should be able to make their own assignments because they can make the time to do their work, can make their own instructions, and show what they have learned. Teachers ever year are teaching the new generation what they need to know and how to do it. They should let their students design their own assignments because it'll be a huge benefit for them, and as well a huge one to teachers. These students can come up with amazing projects that may lead to teachers using their projects to be assigned to other students. And to the teachers reading this, let us have a chance to do it.Â",

    essay:
      "Projects over the summer? Seems unreal to adults, but the students are the ones who have to complete the project. All of the projects are normally teacher designed and are made to challenge the students, which benefits the students in the long run. If a student, or body of students was to design the project that the entire school would have to complete, it would most likely be too easy and would be completed in a matter of a week or two. These students also have no experience in designing a project, as the teachers do this for a living, so having a student design it, the project would be much too easy and would make no sense at all. So, teachers should always be the ones who design summer projects for the high school students.\n \n If students designed a project that they were supposed to complete, they would make it too easy. Why would a student(s) design a project that they have to complete at some point throughout the summer, and make it insanely hard for themselves and other students? In fact, they would not, they would make the project or assignment simple and short for ease of completion. When a student goes on break he or she will not want to do anything but have fun, and by having a project this would eliminate part of the fun. So, if a student designed it, they would make it work not only around their schedule, but also around their free time in order to have the most fun during break. If a teacher was to create the project, it would be long, hard, and complicated in order to make the students think and keep their brain working over the entirety of summer break. Which leads me to my next point, why have a student do it, when a teacher gets paid to do it, and do it well?\n \n When a teacher has been creating material for students to do for his or her entire life, why switch to students to create this work? Well, we should not, having students create their own assignments would be pointless, as they have teachers to do it and assign the project to them for a living. Teachers know much more than students when it comes to designing any sort of work that gets assigned to the students. When a student designs an assignment it also adds even more work for them to do as well as more stress for the students, which can add up as time goes on, as there is only so much work a student canÂ do at once. Teachers are also much better at designing projects that fit everyone in the class as the teacher knows how most people learn and how they learn the best, whether that be though working hands on, via audio, or visual learning. The teacher will always produce a better project, which is why teachers should stay making the assignments and students should continue to complete them without complaining. Also, would students not attempt to post-pone the completion of the design in order to cancel it altogether.\n \n Via post-poning the entire design of the project, students would think that this would cancel the entirety of the project, which is false. This is another advantage of having a teacher design the project, he or she would most likely get the project designed and handed out to the students in a timely manor. This is something that most of the students would not be able to do, so having a student design it is not the best option. There could also be many setbacks and distractions for the students, like phones, jobs, friends, etc. All of these are examples of distractions that could set the project design back a lot. Although teachers could have the same problems, they are much more mature and know how to deal with the distractions as well as get work done at the same time. These are all reasons that the teachers would get the project designed in a more timely manor than the students.\n \n Finally students would not be the best option for designing these summer projects because students would try to make it too easy, post pone the project design, as well as teachers get paid for this as it is their job. So, students would slack off and get little to no work done due to distractions, and clever ways to get out of designing and completing the project. So teachers should stay designing the project and this should not change for good reason as well.",

    essay: "As summer break begins, students utilize the time as a break from school to complete and indulge themselves into numerous and fun activities. However, to ensure the active learning of students, some school assign projects that require work being done over the break. With that being said, the projects should be designed by students than teachers to ensure the creativity and originality of the projects assigned as well as, the development of the students coming into the new school year.\n \n Student designed projects will allow students to be solely responsible for their learning and topics in which the project will be on. This will eventually display each individual's independence and ability to complete the project and will hopefully allow the student to accommodate skills such as time management and a sense independence in their work. As students work on their projects, they will able to complete them on their own time with their own ideas that interest them. With student designed projects, they will know how to follow their own instructions, rules and regulations concerning the project and determine their own continued learning outside of school during the break that will benefit them as individuals. Seeing that the students do well, this will further contribute to their qualities and assist in building them up as fit individuals of society. Also with the independenceÂ of being able to create their own assignment, teachers will become eager to see what the students have come up with and surprised with the work and skills the students will show through their projects in which they have accommodated. This will effectively allow teachers to be amazed with the learning abilities of the students and base their teachings around the completion of the projects in order to ensure the success of the students. Teachers will also be able to understand the students views and standpoints as well as, where they're coming from as far as knowledge goes. Schools will see the benefit of allowing the students to design their projects based off the maturity and work executed by the students through their summer projects.\n \n As the students are gaining the knowledge needed in completing the projects, they can develop a sense of authenticityÂ and creativity by designing themselves. Students can include their own unique and funÂ ways of development and learning into the projects to assist them completing it in the best way possible. By doing so, the students can enjoy learning, work and projects all at the same time. Furthermore, they can develop innovative thinking strategies while including their own interests in which allow them to formulate an excellent project. Student designed project over teacher designed projects also benefit the students more directly because it targets their own thinking and reasoning in which contribute to the creativity but mainly the authenticity aspect of it . Students will possibly utilize a topic that caters to their continued learning outside of school. This can help build up their character and personality by displaying it through the assigned projects in which they developed. Schools can then see the head spaceÂ of their students and then allow them to have more control over their learning.\n \n Hopefully with student developed and designed projects, students can display their own learning qualities and create excellent projects that display what the schools intend them to learn over the break. Also this can give teachers a bit of a surprise and a break as well by allowing the students to take control of how they want to learn. By the school and teachers doing so, they can grant the students with the leverage and ability to learn in their own individual and innovativeÂ ways.Â  Â Â Â Â",

    essay: "Summer Projects\n \n As students get older, more teachers assign summer projects to insure that the students are prepared for the following school year. However, in many instances, students are not engaged in what they are learning. Summer projects should be a collaborative effort between both the student and the teacher to insure that all students and teachers feel like they are heard and grow along the way.\n \n Teachers need to be a part of designing summer projects in order to maintain the level of learning and to stay on topic. With teachers contributing to the project, they are able to steer projects down a certain path in order to make sure that the students are getting what they should be out of it. By including teachers into the project building, they make sure that what the students are doing is educational along with reasonable for the class and that the students aren't trying to give themselves minimal amounts or work. For instance, many English teachers make their students read books over the summer and reflect on the book itself. This gives students an individualized opportunity to advance and excel as they get to follow along with what a teacher, a specialist in a specific field, knows about a topic while applying it out on their own.\n \n Students should be a part of the summer project process in order to not only have a more leadership and engaging role, but to also insure that they are learning about something that they are interested in. Multiple reports and experiments done, such as one on\n \n Brain Games , shows that kids have a more creative mind. In a specific clip of a\n \n Brain Games experiment, adults and children were asked to come up with as many pictures or figures as they could with a ball and two sticks. The children more than doubled the amount of images that the adults did. This shows the creativity that students have, and applying that to a lesson will help make the lesson more intriguing for young minds. Students generally like projects that give them a creative boost; for instance, when teachers say they can present something in any way that they want. And allowing students and teachers to work on designing summer projects together keeps the projects civil and in range, but also gives it the opportunity for it to be fun and creative.\n \n In addition, including students in the development of summer projects benefits them and the rest of their classmates. If a child is given a book, they may read it, or they may not. However, if a child gets to pick out a book, they are much more likely to be attached to it and feel the urge to read it, as it is theirs . The same thing applies to students of all ages. If students help design the summer projects, it allows them an opportunity to get attached to something and to take pride in something. In many cases, this causes people to work harder and care more about what they are doing, rather than just taking it for a grain of salt and moving along.\n \n When dealing with students and teachers working together, some might say that there then is an unfair advantage to those who designed the project when it comes time to grading. The solution to this, though, is that it is not that teacher that is grading the projects. When students move on to the next grade level, they have a new teacher. So if a 10th grade student is helping design their summer project, it will be graded by their 11th grade teacher, therefore eliminating any bias. Another solution to this problem is to have students create the summer project for the class that they were in at the time. For instance, a 10th grader could help design a project for the rising 10th graders, thus eliminating any bias along with allowing them to see what they liked about the previous project and make any changes that they think are necessary.\n \n Finally, both parties are equally vital to summer projects because apart from getting a better education, it teaches students and teachers to work together on issues and education, which is something that is hard to find throughout the school year. Throughout the normal school year, teachers are seen as the authority figure with all of the power in the classroom setting. Although that is true in a way, having students and teachers collaborate on projects opens up a door for them to share ideas, as most students feel their ideas on a normal basis are sub-par and often times don't end up sharing them. It helps bridge the gap between teachers and students, allowing them to be more trusting while also gaining respect for one another. By allowing this collaboration, students will be able to see the hard work that teachers put into lessons and such and might end up appreciating it more, while teachers may gain a clearer insight on how students think after working with students.\n \n It is evident that both students and teachers should design summer projects for the students in order to get the best quality work out of the project itself along with helping them both grow as people. By allowing this crossover bridge for students and teachers, it helps the education system grow as a whole and offers both teachers and students an opportunity for growth, and growth is what the education system and teaching is all about.",

    essay: "When thinking of summer most people tend to relate this season to the idea of relaxation . However, this is not the case for everyone. Students in higher level classes are assigned summer projects to make sure they continue their learning over the long break. By making these projects student-designed it gives the students a way to be independent, find their inner motivation, and use creativity rather than a teacher designing it for them\n \n During the school year almost every assignment is given to the students by teachers. Everything is revolved around what the teachers want. By allowing the student to design their own project in the summer it makes the assignment a little more enjoyable for the student. Summertime is when the students are given independence away from their teachers. If they are allowed to design their own projects chances are they will perform better on the assignment.\n \n Summer projects are typically given to students enrolled in higher level classes. In order for students to do well in these types of classes they have to have their own motivation to complete assignments. I am currently enrolled in an AP class and I also had to complete a summer assignment. I had to come up with a hypothetical experiment and review ways to improve the experiment. In order to do this I had to have motivation to design the experiment rather than relying on a teacher to design it for me.\n \n Allowing the students to design something of their own gives them the ability to use creativity. Not only is this more enjoyable for the students, but also for the teachers. If a teacher has to grade the same general project over and over again that can become very boring. However, grading projects that were designed differently can be more enjoyable for the teacher. Completing my summer project of course was not the best thing in the world, but being able to use my own creativity made it a lot more tolerable.\n \n No one wants to spend their summer completing school work. Summer is a time for students to step back from the stresses of school and enjoy the long break. However, preparing for the future never stops, and summer projects are not going away. When summer projects are student-designed it gives the students a chance to be independent, find their inner motivation, and use creativity in order to enjoy getting the assignment done.Â",

    essay: "There are some schools that require summer projects for the students. What if they were student-designed rather than teacher-designed? With student going into their summer break and also teachers the thought of school really doesn't come to mind. With the requirements of the projects of students during the summer maybe students can add their own spice to the mixture. My thoughts on the idea that the project should be student based is that they can have their own personality to their project, put their own time into it, and the teachers can get to know their students.\n \n With the idea that the project should be student based they can add their own twist to the project. I have a friend who went around Europe with her family during the summer. During her time there she still had to do a project for one of her classes and wasn't getting back home till a week before school started back up again. So during her stay she went to the popular places in Europe and tried to make connections of those places for her project. She told me that she had a lotÂ of fun doing that with her project and that it even made it fun for her when she would edit it because it reminded her of the fun times that she had over there. Even though during the trip she said she preferred that she didn't have to work on a project during the time that she was away from school. She still had fun during the process with the idea that she had control over how she wanted to design it.\n \n There are many students that usually get summer jobs so they might not have all the time in the world to focus on a project. My brother was some one that loved to work and when summer came around he would work all the time. He was in art classes in his high school years so they had to get some art pieces during the summer. At times at work if things weren't busy he would just get a napkin and draw little sketchesÂ that might come to mind. With some of his days off he would look back at the little sketches that he made and see if anything thing that he drew would give him inspiration. That's how he would do his art project and it worked for him. He pulled out multiple beautiful artworks that to this day he is very proud of. At time he wouldn't do some of the artwork since he might of been very busy the day prier and might of been very tired. He still had pushed even harder when he did work on the project. My brother would work during the summer and with the spare time that he had he would more effort into the project with the time he had free.\n \n Teachers can already get a basic idea on what kind of person that they might be getting in their coming up class. I'm good friends with my sophomore history teacher so we talk before school. She planned a project for the up coming sophomores to see what's their personality was and if they basic history. She told me that she can see many different personality in her class by just looking at their projects. Some student are very artistic or they know details about certain events that went on in history. You can see so much in a singleÂ project of a student that they make it into their own. Right out of the back she already knew how to approach and what they can do in the future so that the student get their education but also have their own talents shine through. Some students might not put so much effort into their projects so we might not get a heads start into their characteristics. It nice to at leastÂ to have a good understanding of the students before you actually meet them so they can have an amazing school year.\n \n With the idea that students should be able to design their own summer project is something that should be talked about. In the past most of the assignments are teachers giving it to the students and expecting them to follow a rubric. Things can change with the student must come up with something that they are proud to show and make it their own. With something small can lead to bigger things like just a simple summer project. Students should be able to add their own personality intoÂ it, put their own time into it, and that teachers can get to know the students though their project.Â Â",

    essay: "If you are assigned a summer project, would you rather you or your teacher assign the topic? Lets face it school work can be boring, but what if you got to choose what the project was based on? It would probably be alot funner, and would make the kids want to do it. Every kid has a big imagination and it is important to use it every chance you get. Maybe once every kid is complete you can compare the different ideas each kid has. Every kid has to want to learn to be able to learn, therefor if the kid is doing a project and its on a topic they will enjoy they are more likely to complete and/or learn for the project.\n \n As a student in high school right now, I know what it is like to do project and how boring they can be. You feel like its a waste of time, and you dont want to do it. But if the teacher allows the students to pick their own topic, the kids would want to do it. They can use their imaginattion, favorite charectors, or even favorite tv show.\n \n Once all the students come back from summer break you can even compare the students ideas. See how every students project is different, how creative each student is, and how far their imagination can go. but also when a student is learning, it can be very boring sitting in school everyday doing worksheets and such, But if the student is learning something they actually enjoy, it will be much easier and let the kids actually want to learn. For example, a student may not be as interested in reading a poem and answer a page full of questions. But if you let that same kid watch a full epesode of sponge bob, then tell that kid to write a story based on that epesode they just watched, they would do it.\n \n Using your imagination in life I believe is key, their is nothing you can't do in life if u put your mind to it. You will make it far in life if you think outside the box. As a kid, using your imagination while working can be one of the biggest benefits but most kids don't realize that. If you do not have an interest in what your learning majority of the time it's going to go in one ear and out the other. That is why if you use your imagination while your learning it would brighten some things up and make it funner to do work.\n \n In conclusion, doing work that the student can decide on would be a better learning experience for the kids, easier, and more effective. And if you are like me, then you can use your imagination to turn any assigned work into a better learning experience.Â  Â Â Â Â",

    essay: "When asked to do summer projects, students normally cringe a little. But, if you let the students choose what the project should be about, then they will want to complete it a little bit more than when a teacher designs it. In this paper I will be explaining why students should design their own projects instead of teachers. Students should design their own projects because they will be more excited and eager to work on it, the projects would be better because the students would most likely spend more time on it, and lastly the students would get to enjoy more of their summer because they would get the project done and not feel like they worked super hard.\n \n If the students were to design their own project they would be more eager to work on it. This is because the people that make the topic usually have some interest in the topic. And with interest in the topic the students would want to work and actually spend time on the project. When a teacher makes a project it is almost always less appealing than a student made project. Causing the students to not want to work on it and learn. this is why a student made project would cause the students to be eager and ready to learn more about the topic.\n \n Furthermore, the projects would be better because the students actually care about them. See when a teacher makes the project, A student like myself would just rush to get it done and get a good passing grade then enjoy my summer. but if students made it, I would most likely spend a little more time on it causing the project to be more complete and more presentable. In return students would get a decent grade, be more informed about the topic, and get to feel better about themselves in the end.\n \n Lastly, students would get to enjoy more of their summer. It would feel like this anyway because the student made project wouldnt really feel like a project. especially if it is a group project, it would just be like hanging with your friends in the summertime. and If you are a really eager student, you could get the project done in the first week or two of the summer then get to spend the rest of your time doing whatever you like to do during the summer.\n \n In conclusion, A student made project would be the best option for the students. Because the would get to enjoy their summer and learn a little at the same time. and in all they wouldnt feel obligated to such a chore during the summer.\n \n I hope you can understand why the student body should make their own projects for the summer and not teachers.",

    essay: "A friend once said to me that summer is a giant break for us students to relax and recover from the stress of school. Some schools do require summer based projects during the break to keep us learning though. Sometimes these projects are teacher based or even student based. Teachers however, should not be designing summer based projects. Summer based projects should be student designed because students are more likely to enjoy them, it gives the students a chance to take action, and it helps give teachers insight on what they could do better.\n \n If students design the summer projects, they are more likely to enjoy and be more invested in them. One time in summer school, I was in a class where we were solving a mystery. The mystery however, was left open ended and did not really have an ending. I remember all my classmates being really upset. If students were involved in the creation of this activity, they could have made it have a more meaningful ending as to what students might have wanted.\n \n Next, Summer based projects should be fun for the students. They should be able to enjoy them without having to stress too much over them. Students are going to likely be moreÂ interested in the project if they create it themselves. Students might feel limited otherwise as to what they can do if it were a PowerPoint for example. There was a time where I wanted to do a drawing for a summer project, but my idea was rejected. I did not have as much fun with my project than I would have with my drawing.\n \n Last but not least, teachers could benefit and learn how to improve summer projects. Teachers often design he majority of what we do whether it be lessons, notes or even projects. Teachers could learn and observe how we may want to do the projects. My mom is a high school teacher and she often asks me for advice as to what might help students not just learn, but also have fun or not hate school even. Teachers could give out monthly surveys as a way to help them gain feedback. Summer projects could work in a similar fashion. Teachers should also give students more independence and time to work on large projects.\n \n Maybe some students in the past could have enjoyed school or summer projects more if they were student based. In the future, students should take the initiative and design more summer projects. Students should do this so they can get the most out of their learning. There might be some adults who say that students are just going to take advantage of them designing the projects and be lazy with it. However, students should learn how to do this kind of project based planning. It will help them be more independent and creative. Students should design summer projects so they can more likely enjoy them, help give teachers advice as to what they could improve, and it can help students mature.",

    essay: "Some Schools want students to complete projects during the summer. These projects should be Student-designed because it will make students want to do them,ensure that they actually learn and it will help with their future. It could also set them up for collage or what they plan on doing after Highschool. Here are a few reasons i think the students should get to decide what their project is on.\n \n The first reason is, it will make them more interested. If students can pick their topic or even what they do they might actually want to complete it. A lot of times in School your projects may not be on something your interested in, which makes you not want to do it as much. If you can pick theres no way you wont be interested because you picked the topic. Also if they get to choose what they do as a project, for example community service, essay about someone or something, or doing an internship could be be great things for them to do but they will learn in a fun way.\n \n The next reason is it might help them with a future job. If someone were to do a project on something there interested in as a career it might help them decide if they want to do that. It will also open up possible jobs they didnt even know about but know have a chance to learn about. This could be really good for kids unsure about their future. This could even land them a job before they leave high schoolÂ which sets them up well for the future. It will set them up for collage also.\n \n The last reason would be good grades. In schools kids dont always get good grades. Part of the reason this happens is because their not interested in the topic. It can be hard to study something you dont like and do well on it. If the students made the choice they could pick whatever they wanted and could really have a good time doing this project. If students decided on their own project the teachers could really get an understanding of how that students actually preforms, not how they do in class on something the dont like.\n \n Allowing students to decide their project could really allow for them to show their true potential. This project will not only help kids be more interested in what thy are learning about it will also help with the future out of Highschool and maybe even their grades in school. In conclusion a Student decided project will benefit the kids the most.",

    essay: "Often times, students disagree with and frown upon summer assignments, despite them helping to maintain their own educational growth.Â Many schools call for students to do projects over the summer to assure that they both have learned, and will continue to learn over the break. These summer projects should be designed by teachers, ensuring that: students actually learn something, students are being challenged, and that students' stress isn't piled up by them designing their own assignments.\n \n Teacher designed summer projects are needed because, if actually completed, they guarantee that the student will retain new information. Although not over-break assignments, DECA projects, which are designed by DECA executives, have produced countless intelligent people that can solve real world problems with ease. DECA is a national organization in which peers compete against one another through the creation of business solutions projects. Many students who have participated in DECA and have solved these types of issues,either come out of secondary education feeling confident about economics, or actually go into the business field. Projects like these teach students how to use whatever they are learning, in a non-classroom environment, ultimately boosting student growth.\n \n Assignments to be completed over the break are not meant to take away from the summer experience, but to challenge children enough to maintain and grow their educational ability. This purpose of summer assignments, is best suited by teacher modeling, because this presents a greater challenge to students. Some might argue that by students modeling their own projects, they are able to challenge themselves a great deal, without going over their personal limit. However, many young people will actually take advantage of being able to design their own assignments. For example, in my honors science classes, we would always have a year long, Science Symposium Assignment. In these assignments, me and a partner would design our own experiment and create a final trifold explaining the processes. Me and my partner always came up with the baseline knowledge experiments, so that we could earn a good grade without challenging ourselves. To this day, I do not recall the conclusions of those experiments, persuading me to believe if the teacher adminstered our project topics, we would have learned more.\n \n Students who are assigned such large projects are typically already stressed about the fact that they have to complete the project. Allowing the students to design their own projects would greatly increase their stress levels as they now remotely have two seperate assignments. My father, who is in the Army Special Forces, was once faced with this issue. As the leader of his team, he was instructed to find out where they would carry out a home invasion and how they would carry out the invasion. Normally, he would have already been told where to do it, and would just have to figure out how to do it. This put a lot of stress on him at this time, and actually led to a failed mission because his stress levels trumped is intelligence. Having to design your own methods for carrying out an assignment is detrimental to the outcome, for all types of people, especially students.\n \n Schools administering assignments similar to these, should be very cautious as to how they want the products to be done. It should definitley be made a priority that all projects are innovated by teachers in order to assure that the students are learning, reduce students' stress as much as possible, and to challenge and hold students accountable.Â  Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â",

    essay: "My response is that I think that completing summer projects over the summer should be student-designed. When you take a long summer break, sometimes you can forget details you learned from schools because you have not been to school for so long. Also I think it is a good idea because doing this can give students more responsolities to have will they have fun during the summer.\n \n Another reason why I support this is because when student's don't go to school for so long they can forget alot of things in that time period. So a good way to keep their brain actively particapating in school things, should be the students doing projects over the summer. Also the students doing projects will help them for the next upcoming school year and their brain will already be warmed up. Another way this helps students is this prepairs them for the upcoming school year so the students wont be behind on things and they will be actively ready.\n \n My second supporting reason is that it's okay for students to take breaks, but they also should always be learning and doing things at the same time. I dont think the teachers should be doing school projects because they have already got their diploma's and knows what they are going to teach for the next year. But by the teachers giving us projects keeps us busy and more focused on school work. Also making students do projects can teach students alot of responsibilities, because doing these projects is like our job for example; when you work for an company and you don't do assignments when you have free time you can get fired for not taking responsibiity and doing what you are supposed to do, Students taking projects over the summer is simular to an actual job.\n \n The third reason on why I support my response is because students doing there projects helps them stay focus, consistant, and on task. If the teachers are doing the projects and the students are not actively learning on their summer break then they are not going to be prepared for the next school year. Also when the students are not learning for a long time, the students can get lazy and not want to do work because they are so used to going home and relaxing. By the students acting lazy and relaxing they won't start off with a good school year and can affect their grades and not stay focused. Also when a students is not actively learning, they can loose intrest in learning which can affect their behaivoir.\n \n Staying actively learning can help students tremendsly. It's very immportant for students to stay actively learning and not getting out of focus. When students stay actively learning and doing projects over breaks, it can impove your working and learning skills. All of these reason can help students in their school work and continuesly want to do work and do their responsibilites. These are my reasons on why i support students doing their projects over the summer.",

    essay: "Schools deciding to give projects over the summer, should allow their students to design their own unique project. Teachers providing the project will most likely cause frustration in students. This could stem from a subject that is boring or they they do not like. Also, students do not want to spend all summer doing school work, so this will give students a more enjoyable learning experience. Requiring students to create their summer projects will allow students to enjoy their assignment, help them learn more efficient, and increase student responsibility.\n \n Letting students design their own summer project will give students a more enjoyable experience with their project. Most likely, students will choose a topic that they like. This motivates them to accomplish their project because they will want to learn more about their favorite food, theme park, or animal. If teachers were to pick students topics, then teachers would pick a plain boring subject. This would make students feel made to do it, which will decrease the chances of them finishing it. Also, doing a project on a hobby or favorite snack allows students to experiment with it to conclude valuable data. This gives students evidence to why they enjoy their hobby or favorite snack. Overall, allowing students to create their own project will create a better and more enjoyable atmosphere.\n \n Also, schools giving their students the right to create their own summer assignment helps students learn more efficient. More importantly, students that struggle to learn or focus will find these projects easier. It will also help them learn more and remember the information on the project. Students coming up with their own ideas gets them more excited, because they are not being forced to do their project on a topic they know anything about. This excitement to learn more about a topic creates a more efficient working environment, which helps students complete assignments. Also, students given summer projects by teachers will decrease the value of the project. Most students will find shortcuts or acquire help from a another student, sibling, or parent. However, students picking their own project will push them to gather the data on their own.\n \n In addition, allowing students to design their own summer project will increase responsibility. Most people have been given everything since they were born, whether that be food, a home, or as small as a homework assignment. Yet, this makes people dependent on people to do things for them. However, giving students the right to create and accomplish their own project establishes responsibility in their life. They have to come up with the topic, gather data, and be able to show it on a poster or power point, all while having to finish in a certain amount of time. Students grasping the importance of responsibility will only prepare them for college and a job. The people and students with it succeed more often, because they have good time management, do their job, and understand its importance.\n \n Having students create their own project, benefits them abundantly. It creates a better learning enviorment, while establishing importances in their life. Teachers creating the project for the students is no different from the school year students just faced. However, giving students some responsibility to accomplish a simple summer project is more than just a grade.",

    essay: "Summer projects are dreaded by most students, despite the beneficial continuity in learning they provide during the otherwise schoolwork-free summer break. Such projects are only rewarding if they include information relevant to the corresponding course they were assigned for, making the idea of \"busy work\" both unecessary and hated by students (as is often the case in more open ended student-designed assignments). Teacher-designed summer assignments are far more effective than student-designed alternatives, as teachers can integrate necessary and prerequisite information for the course, the assignments are less open to interpretation and more focused, and students recieve an assignment that is both more impactful and less work-intensive.\n \n Teachers are well versed in their respective subjects, and have a good understanding of what information is necessary in order to succeed in a specific course. They are able to structure summer assignments in correspondence with key information, helping students start a course off strong. My AP Biology teacher illustrated such a well-directed summer assignment last year. She included information that was necessary for the transition into an AP science course, leading to the majority of the class being well-versed in key concepts by the beginning of the school year. This was reflected by the class average of an A in the first quarter. The alternative of a less directed student-designed project would lack the benefit of being structured by an individual knowledgable in key topics and would likely prove detrimental to both grades and overall understanding.\n \n More often than not, student-designed projects entail open exploration of a plethora of topics. While this can sometimes be beneficial, such open interpretation leads to less directed focus on the actual cirriculum, making the student-designed approach less effective than the teacher-designed counterpart. My computer science teacher assigned such a flawed project during this past summer, requiring students to merely explore and document anything computer related and create a project based on the findings. While such a project took student interest into account, it had little to no focus on the actual coding and programming cirriculum of the course. If my teacher had assigned us a project that required gaining a decent and basic understanding of code instead of an open ended exploration, we would have likely gained far more knowledge relevant to the course and a better idea of what the course's focus would be.\n \n Students already loathe the idea of doing work over the summer. Requiring students to not only complete a summer assignment, but forcing them to design it as well is both aimless and unecessary. Teachers designing these assignments with intentful structure makes the completion of the such projects less rigorous and more impactful, including the actual cirriculum of a given course without forcing the students to do any extra work in designing the project. Students want to enjoy their summer and not be weighed down by a huge project. Cutting down on unecessary work would make students and teachers alike happier, as students have less to do and teachers have less to grade, making teacher-designed projects the logical choice.\n \n Teacher-designed summer projects are more impactful than student-designed ones, as teachers have a good idea of what information is key for understanding of important concepts, they can narrow the focus of the project to aid in transition into the subsequent course, and they are less rigorous and more impactful. Students will appreciate the boost in understanding provided by a well structured teacher-designed project.",

    essay: "Everyone loves summer! Drinking ice cold lemonade while laying in the sizzling hot sun and enjoying the warm wind blowing. Children love playing outside an enjoying their vacation time with their friends and family, away from school and stress. While some school find it beneficial to have students continue learning even over break. Thats why student-designed summer projects are perfect! In fact, they are more beneficial then teacher- designed summer projects because the students are more interested, they are willing to do it on their own, and it helps the community grow.\n \n Students having to do student-designed summer projects gets students more excited than having to do something that is forced. Students mostly like to do things that interests them and things that gets them excited to have fun and relax at the same time. For example, some students might like to do projects that involves being outside while others might enjoy projects where they can stay inside and can relax while working. With teacher-designed projects, the students are limited to do things they find amusing. Students are likely to do better when they are with their friends and are having fun. For example, students prefer group projects rather than individual projects because when they are working in a group they entire workload isn't on them.\n \n Students are willing to do things, that they find amusing, on their own. You won't see someone doing something they don't enjoy unless they are forced to. Summer projects are like subjects in school, some students are great at math but that doesn't mean they enjoy math. Summer projects are meant to help keep students on track but also enjoy their summer time with fun things. Many students, especially high school students, like to get summer jobs to earn some money before leaving for college. Some students like to work outside in the heat as a lifeguard while others like to work as a cashier in a fast food restaurant. No one is the same, everyone has their own interest and willingness to do things. Like that, some students might like working on summer projects that involves music but others might like projects that involves arts. Everyone has their own ways and choice of doing things.\n \n Lastly, student-designed projects helps the society grow. All these projects and programs help students decide what they really want to do in the future. Even though something might interest them right now, might be boring in the future. Students also learn many beneficial things from these projects, it can really help them grow and change into a better person. Some of these programs can even lead to future careers and jobs. For example, many students that do coding projects want to pursue computer science as their career while other students wanting to do art projects want to pursue theater as their career.\n \n Even though many may say that teacher-designed projects are more beneficial, it is not entirely true. teachers don't know their students interest as well as the students know themselves. Some students might be excellent at one subject but that doesn't mean that the subject interests them. Therefore, student-designed projects are much more beneficial them teacher designed projects and it interests the students more. Summer projects are meant to help students stay on track by learning but its also meant to be fun and amusing!Â",

    essay: "Is a teacher designed summer project better than one that is student designed? As a student I've had plenty of summer projects, but they were always due within 2 months of school starting. Although some may say it would be for a student to make their own summer project , personally I think a project made by a teacher isn't a horrible idea. Teachers should design these assignments because, some student would try their best to do the bare minimum or their project would make absolutely no sense. The main idea of a summer project is to keep your mind active in those months of little to no brain activity. In the 9th grade i had a summer project for my AP world History class i was going to take the following school year, the project was designed by my teacher, it was a lot, but it prepared me for my AP class that next school year. Now I know that it could be easier on the students and the teacher, if a student were to make their own project, and it would teach students independence, along with learning how to manage your time wisely, and a teacher could spend more time working on the curriculum they have to teach. Teachers have always designed summer project, but maybe one day the students will get the opportunity to create their own project, however, it would be in it's best interest if teachers created a list of things they could and couldn't do for their project. Although I think teachers know the best way to create a project that is fit to prepare a student.Â",

    essay: "Summer is supposed to be a time for students to take a break from learning, be able to go on vacation, and relax. Althought, summer is primarily for relaxation, schools don't want sudents to fall behind during those months, or forget what they learned in the previous year. Due to this, many schools have introduced summer projects for students to complete to build on what they learned and to prepare them for the upcoming year. Some schools allow for these projects to be student-designed, where others have made the teacher-designed. Summer projects should be teacher-designed to ensure students are learning based on what they need to know coming into the next year, allow for teachers to be able to help them easier, and give them the highest probability of suceeding in the upcoming year.\n \n Teacher designed projects would allow for student to have a baseline understanding of the information they need to know. During the summer going into sophmore year, I was assigned a summer project by my AP World History teacher. She gave us a very long project about 600bc, and I was not intrested at all. I worked on it all summer, and by the time school started, she began to teach the information I had learned in the summer. The project had made the first part of the corse a lot easier. I didn't struggle understanding the information because I already knew it. If I had picked my own project i don't believe I would have been as prepared to start a hard class like AP World History as much as I was because of my teacher-designed summer project.\n \n Along with preparing kids for new informtion they will need to understand, having teacher-designed summer projects would allow for the teacher to be able to help their student easier. If a student had a question about their project, and the student choose what it was on, the teacher may not know how to help because of the fact they didn't design it. It would make the teacher unsure of the direction the student may be taking with their project, and ultimetly making it difficult to help them. On the other hand, if the teacher had designed the project, they would know exactly how to help a struggling student because they took the time to create it and understand the ideas.\n \n Although having techers design the student projects, allowing for them to be student-designed would allow for more diverse and creative projects. Kids would be able to choose something that intrestes them verses having to do something assigned that they don't care about. The more a student is intrested and wants to learn about a topic, the more effort they are going to put into the project. With students choosing their project it would seem like less of a chore to do during their time off. It may also be benifitial for the teacher too see how their students work and how creative they are before the year is fully underway.\n \n Not only would schools having teacher-designed projects allow for students to grain helpful knowledge before the school year starts and have the highest chaces at succeding, but it would also help the teacher know how to help student that are struggling. Having student-designed projects may allow for more student creativity and intrest, but might be less benifitial in the long run. Schools should have teacher-designed projects during the summer to ensure maximum learning and ensure their students the best chances of succeding.Â",

Summer projects should be student-designed because it allows them to do their project on something they are passionate about, they are given more creative freedom, and their classmates can learn new things instead of everyone doing their project on the same topic.\n \n With the load of school, extracurriculars, and homework students do not have nearly enough time to do things they are passionate about. Allowing students to pick their own summer project would give them the opportunity to learn more about something they love and get a grade on it. Additionally, if the project is about something that a student does not feel any sort of emotion towards, chances are, the student will not take as much time making it a great project because they do not care about the subject.\n \n When a student completes a project outside of school it could be a variety of things. It could be a painting, a clay pot, or even a table. All of those things require the student to be creative and make it their own. School projects should somewhat resemble these projects. Students should at the very least be given a chance to use their own creative skills to make the project their own, instead of them being given a list of things to include in a powerpoint. If the students' were allowed to pick their own summer projects they would have so much creative freedom to really do the best they could on their project and make it something they are proud of.\n \n Say there are around thirty kids in a class, and every kid has to present a project on the same topic.

    essay: "There are over 1,000 students who are required to complete summer assignments. There are the ones who do complete the summer assignments and the ones who do not complete the summer assignments. Many believe that the summer assignments are to difficult to complete and even question if the summer assignments should really be teacher-designed or changed to make it student-designed. However, others believe that they should keep the summer assignments the way they are and keep it teacher-designed and not make it student-designed or else it would be to easy. With all of this information in mind, the summer assignment should be teacher-designed because they make people think on how a problem should be solved, they make them ready for a challenging situation, and they help people retain lost information.\n \n One reason to have the summer assignments teacher-designed, is so people think about how a problem is solved. Teacher-designed summer assignments ask difficult questions to help students not to make student think that they can not do the summer assignment. This helps students by making them think instead of giving them a simple multiple or addition question. It challenges the mind and creates a path of emotions along the way; but when people finish, it is the most satisfying thing in the whole universe. Then afterwards, being able to share the experience with people, makes others want to do it to or do something more complex. Having teachers design problems, that make people think, can change people's life. This is true for one girl, named Generic_Name, who had a teacher give her a summer assignment that for math. As she was doing the summer assignment, she found a question that was difficult and complex to the point where she didn't understand how to do it. However, she decided she would figure it out and complete the summer assignment, in which she did, by using the formula and topics she already knew and by looking some stuff up, she was able to complete the question and get a perfect score on her summer assignment.\n \n Having a teacher-designed summer assignment can make people ready for a Challenging situation. By completing the summer assignments, it shows that some students can handle challenging and complex problems and situations. Some of the problems on a summer assignment could be seen in the real world; so by finishing those problems it makes people ready for success in the real world. For example, If a teacher were to give a student a summer assignment dealing with math, and one of the questions on the assignment was complex and difficult but that student was able to figure it out from past knowledge, then when the student is an adult and ends up seeing that question again the student would be able to figure it out and would get the satisfaction of completing it. So even if a problem is challenging on a summer assignment, completing it and getting the right answer will make people successful in the future.\n \n In contrast to that, there are people who end up solving the difficult problems and go through the challenges of a summer assignment, but they either never end up using that advantage or just forget it altogether. However, there are people who never forget the problems on a summer assignment because writing it and doing the problem without cheating or giving up helps people remember the problems. Completing the summer assignment also helps people retain information for the following school year. For some students once the school year is over they forget everything they learned and end up having to catch up once they get back in school. But having teacher-designed summer assignments helps students get the information they need to know for the following school year not just random information from several years ago.\n \n With teacher-designed summer assignments, students would do fantastic throughout the school year than if they were given student-designed summer assignments. They would be able to accurately use the information they have and think about the problems. They would be able to experience the difficulty of the problems and experience the satisfaction of completing a complex problem. They also would be able to bring back forgotten information that they need for the following school year or for their future. So having a teacher-designed summer assignment rather than a student-designed summer assignment would be better; not just for students, but teachers as well.",

    essay: "Summer projects should be designed by teachers and not the students. First off, when a student is on summer break, they usually don't want to do any more work than they have to, and making students design their own projects would make them less likely to complete the project. Second, a teacher designing the projects would mean that the accuracy of the project would better help the students learn as well as make the students more likely to complete the project before school starts.\n \n When a student has to design their own project, that gives the student more work than necessary for a summer assignment. If a student is given too much freedom with the project they are more likely to procrastinate and forget about the project. For example, a student has to design their own project over the summer, but they have no idea what they should do. The student would then decide that they would figure it out later and forget about the assignment. Another reason, is that a student could be going out of town for vacation, and they wouldn't have the time to design their own project while on vacation.\n \n Another reason teachers should design summer projects, is so that students can have detailed guidelines for their projects and learn all necessary information over the summer. If students are left to make their own project, then they are most likely going to do the minimum amount of work and gain very little of what they could be learning. If a teacher designs the project, then they could include everything that the student needs to learn for the upcoming school year while still giving the studnents a reasonable amount of work over the summer. For example, a student on vacation wouldn't have time to design and complete their own project, but if there are clear guidelines for the project, the student could complete the project around their vacation schedule.\n \n Some people might disagree by saying that creativity would help the students in the long run, and while I beleive that creativity is a good thing, I also beleive that giving students an actual break over the summer could do a lot of good. This doesn't mean I think that students should have no work to do over the summer, but I do think that less is better in this case. The \"creativity\" that the students would be missing out on could easily bee made up during school hours, giving the students some breathing room over the summer.\n \n Overall, I beleive that summer projects should be designed by the teachers, not by the students. Doing so would give the students enough work over the summer to actually retain information, but still giving them the break that they deserve. It would also give the students guidlines to work from, so that they may complete the assignment before any vacation plans that might prevent them from doing so.",

    essay: "The idea that summer projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed. Should be student-designed cause for the whole school year teachers have assigned papers and projects that they think is a good idea which some of them are, but some of them are confusing and hard to some students.\n \n As a student I feel as if we should come up with our own project, especially that some students want to be teachers one day get a head start on how to come up with aÂ project for their students for the future. For example students may use their teachers project that they assigned them and put a twist on it something that is fun to work on,but teachers and some students think that it should be teacher-designed cause some students have a mindset and think teachers have been giving out projects all year why stop now. Which is a lazy mindset students should want to make their own project. One student might just go as far and say why can't it be both and the teachers and the students come up with a project and combine it which is great but as students get told to do these assignments and projects from their teacher and they are specific projects with a rubric there isnt much a student can do but go by what they are told from the rubric, no brainstorm ideas just get an A and go by the rubric. It should be student-designed cause students have their own ideas and what they can do to make a project better and look appealing you get a project from a teacher and a rubric and you are going off not what you think but the rubric what the teacher wants so every student is doing that, thats why all projects look the same and have the same idea and concept. Teachers argue that it should be teacher-designed because the students are going to do something thats not important like video games or sports not about academics and that is a valid argument, however how do they know what the students are going to do that if they don't get to make their own project. Teachers may say because it is the summer students won't do the project cause there have been assignments where they are given over the weekend and the students still won't do them so if they give the students a project over the summer they will defiantly not get it done which is false that project will be 60% of your grade for the new school year who doesn't want to start out with a perfect grade at the beginning of the year? some students will forget over the summer yes but when the school year is about to begin send an email to a parent or on the remind app so when the students do come back they are ready to present. I would like to see what students come up with and how they would present it students should be able to do summer projects with their rubric that they came up with and doing these student-designed projects will help them with aÂ careerÂ and a job where they need to brainstorm and think of their own ideas instead of getting the exact directions handed to them. It also takes the stress off the teacher in thinking of a summer project, before the end of the year a student-designed project would be good and would benefit the students greatly.",

    essay: "Some schools, require students to complete school related projects during holiday/seasonal break. Teachers, who give their students assignments to be completed during break are more likely create; a more educated student, responsable student, and a more ambicous student.\n \n Teachers who assighn students work during holiday/seasonal breaks, are more likely to have greater test scores from students than teachers who don't assighn work to be completed during break. Study's show that teachers who assighn work during breaks are likely to have better test and quiz grade outcomes, do to students gaining extra practice and gaining more information on a unit that had prevously been taught before break. For example, students who complete assghnments that their teacher had assghined them to do and be completed during break have more study time which students gain more information and knowledge about the unit then a student who dosn't have work assghined to them, meaning students gain extra information and knowledge that they can use during test, quizzes, and class work when comming back from break do to teachers giving them work sheets to be complete at home making them more educated students.\n \n Secoundly, students who are given work during holiday/seasonal break and complete the work that their teacher has assighned them, will become more responsable students. For instance, students who are assighned work and know that their work has to be completed by a certain Date and time, tend to focus on what's really improtant such as their grade in class. Students, know that completing the work on time and at the best of there abilty know that they will gain a good grade in the gradebook and will have a better grade in the classroom as well, But the students also know if the assighnments are not fully completed and on time that there consiquence maybe there grade will drop drastically due to them not completing the task their teacher has assighned forthem. Making the students that where assigned projects to be completed during break, more responsable then other students.\n \n Furthmore, Teachers who have assighned projects to be completed during break are creating ambicous students, and not lazy students who dont want to do class work and assighnments during class time when it becomes time to come back from break. for exmaple,students know that they will be returning back to school when break is over causes students to not loose their focus for school and the their class work when time to come back to school and remembering that holiday/seasonal breaks are just breaks from the school envioment and from fellow class mates that you have been stuck with for a long time period of time. meaning this will cause students to understand that they will be returnng back to schoola nd when they do it will be back to the basic and usaul clas room setting, work, test and quizzes. students who analyize this thought in there mind while doing there work assighned to them on break will not become lazy students that don't want to do anything when they return back to school but instead cause a more ambicouse student who is willing to exceed expectaions from their teachers and their class work.\n \n Summer projects that are assighned by and from teachers are tottaly nessacesary if you want more educated students, responsable students, and a more ambicouse students in your class room.\n \n ;",

    essay: "Ring! the final bell has rung its now officially summer. Though there is still school work to be done, teachers have designed a summer assignment to complete. Although some may believe otherwise teachers should design summer projects because they know what they want students to learn and keeps students mind in shape\n \n Your grocery shopping, and you discover you need milk. You know what milk you need to buy. Teachers are the same way over summer assignments. Teachers know what they want students to learn over summer. Learning the material a teacher assigns over summer ensures that the student will be ready for the upcoming class in the fall. It also keeps the students busy with work. If students didnt work they wouldnt be successful in life. An example is Mark Zuckerberg, he created Facebook. Mark had a dream about a giant social media platform that you can share things with anyone and keep in touch with friends all over the world anywhere and anytime. The next day Mark started Facebook from his basement. He went everywhere to get investors to invest in Facebook. The dream happened Facebook is currently the leading social media platform for millions of people. He wouldnt be where he is if he didnt work. Students should follow in his footsteps. Students should learn what teachers assign them, and be inspired to learn and work. Who knows maybe they will have the next big idea that will change the world.\n \n Have you ever went to the gym and worked really hard and woke up the next morning barley being able to move. Your mind is the same way. It has to constantly be learning and reviewing to keep information. This helps teachers when assigning summer assignments. When school starts after the break students are familiar with topics from the assignment. If students dont do or review the assignment they will lose some of the learning they acquired from the past school year. This can happen to anyone, It has happened to me. I forgot to do my summer assignment during my freshman year. I walked into the first day of school clueless. I was lost and confused. Nothing made sense to me. It was almost like my teacher was speaking a entire differentÂ language. Now I make sure I do them so Im ready to learn on the first day. In addition, my friend Generic_Name she did her summer assignment. she had a pop quiz on the very first day of school. She got a 82%, if she didnt do her assignment she would have gotten a bad grade. Students should do the assignments teachers gives them. It keeps students from forgetting information, and students can even learn brand new information students have never learned before.\n \n Some may say students should design summer projects because they know what they want to learn. About 67% of students have been over worked in the past year. This shows that students needs a break over summer.\n \n They have completed 9 months of school non stop. Students don't want to learn anything else. Its now summer all they want is a break. They want to go hang out with friends, travel, etc. An example of this is my friend Generic_Name, She took 3 advanced placement classes in the past school year. She was in school for 7 hours a day and did homework for another 9 hours by herself. When summer hit all she did was relax and not stress over the work or test she would always have to rush and complete the next morning. She did 16 hours of school every day for 9 months. Shes not going to do any school work over summer, shes doesn't want to learn anything, all she wants is a break. If the summers projects were up to the students like Generic_Name the only assignment they would assign is to relax. As a result, she will most likely forget information she learned from the past year and put herself in more stress and work.\n \n Teachers know what they want for students, and they design an assignment that helps students minds stay in shape. Students should embrace teachers assignments. They could really help a students future. They keep students busy. They help with not forgetting all the hard work students did in the past year. Teachers assignments are vital in summer its a teacher job to design them.Â",

    essay: "You may not know, but schools have been requiring students to complete summer projects so they can still continue to learn over summer break. You probably wondering now like, why would they do that, but thats not the question. This individual have to explain should the projects contain the teacher designing them or the students designing them. As one, the projects should contain the students designing them because some students like to use their own creativity, when you come up with your own things,accomplish the and do good on it, that make a person feel good about their self, may want to come up with your own soÂ people can use the material that's already at home. yes, some people may think that the teacher should design and some people may think that student should design them, but as one, this essay will contain it being the students designing their own projects.\n \n Well, here will talk about how people like to use their own creativity. For example, I know a female that like to draw, shes very creative and she always drawing on her spare time. If her teacher does not have as much creativity as she does it would not be no fun for her. If the teacher was to design the projects she would not to get to use her creativity as much as she would like. Do not get me wrong she will use it even if her teacher was to design the projects she will not use as much as she would if she was to sit down and think of a design herself. If she can sit down and think of one herself then she can fully use her creativity and then she will have more fun doing the project because she can come up with her own idea.\n \n This specific paragraph will talk about how when people come up with their own ideas and accomplish them, it make them feel good about themselves and it pushes them to do more. If someone had to write a three page paper and had to turn it in by the end of summer break and they plan on having it done by the end of June and they accomplish that goal, its going to make them proud and make them feel good about their selves. Yea, some people may say otherwise such as they only did it because they had no choice and it was grade, but thats not true because people always have a choice. They did it because they wanted to accomplish their goal that they set and they did that. Im pretty sure no students wants to go on summer break and do a project or work because that suppose to be our time off from school. That's our only long break that we get to have.\n \n Last reason contains wanting to pick your own project so people can just use the materials that they have at home instead of going to the store and having to but some materials. For example, if a person was to have supplies to do the project that they want to do and the teacher say, \"i'm going to pick your projects\". Then she give someone a project that you do not have none of the material for and the that person have to go out and spend their precious money on a project. Instead, this is y this should contain students designing their own projects and then that person can just pick a project they already got the materials for.\n \n Finally we reach the end of this confident essay. Some people will not agree to what this person said and some people may agree to what this person said. This person is not here to worry about who agree with her or not she just want to leave her opinion and how she feel about the question. With all that being said, these are this ones reasons to why she think that the school summer projects should be student designed and not teacher designed.

    essay: "I agree that some schools should let students do summer projects sometime over the summer. My main reasons are: staying active, not being lazy, and keeping your brain and yourself on track . During the summer you should want to go out and enjoy the outside world, you can do other things as well and to be creative about things for your school summer project, other than staying indoors and deciding to only sit around and do nothing.\n \n First, the reason I said to stay active is because when you are outside you never know what you will find or discover if you are doing a project, or just simply exploring the world or the envoirment you live in. Discovering new things helps you think about nature and physical activity that is happening all around you. If you are doing a specific project, then maybe you should look for certain things outside, or even think about what would be great to add on to your project. Stay focused and try to look forward into new things that you see for your summer project.\n \n Secondly, for my reason of not being lazy is mostly saying that instead of being at home watching television commercials, or being on your phone all the time, maybe even just sitting and play video games is way worse than enjoying yourself. You could be missing so much fun things that are just waiting for you to explore with outside. It could be new animals you never seen before, something interesting that you might want to experience or hanging with friends. They can even help you on your project to if you want them to join as well. Don't just sit around and put boring things on your project, or words that dont make any since to you or the topic of the project. You want to be creative with your ideas think positive about finding new things and most importantly ,have fun with what you are doing.\n \n Although, you might not be lazy but you must have your brain and yourself on track at all times. School projects are made for you to have fun while doing them, and to meet new people if you are working in groups , or even if you are by yourself and still have positive thoughts for you and your project then everything its going just fine. You must make sure that you feel comfortable to do your school project and to have all the things you need to make your project creative, strong, and well written. Over the summer, you want to go places to enjoy your self and not to sit around and be off tasks all day long.\n \n This section might be a little off topic but I just wanted to say , whatever you do over your summer break is up to you. You can be outside having fun or maybe even inside as well enjoying yourself. Some people would not like to do a creative project outside sometimes but that is okay as well because you can do your project inside too. A lotÂ of times, projects can be for fun or just to be graded when you come back to school. While you are doing your project, it helps you learn more over the summer break and you become interested to do certain things over the break and thats fine to. Being creative is another way of saying, you got this no matter what.\n \n In conclusion, have fun with your project. Don't be afraid to do anything with your project that mainly talks about you or what you like to do in your life. Doing projects makes kids want to do them more over time, and then they might just might, be able to describe many things specifically for their projects. Learning on the other hand, makes you think more than just to not think at all. Just remember, while you are doing these projects once again you must continue to have fun with them. Tell about your life, family, or other and to have a great summer as well.",

    essay: "Over the years teachers have been assigning summer projects. Imagine if students were able to design their own projects for summer break. Some people say students designing their own work will teach them time management. Others say teachers designing summer work will give students a challenge. Summer projects should be teacher designed because students will be more challenged, teachers are more experienced, and students will not be focused. Teachers designing work will benefit students more than students designing work would.\n \n Initially, teachers should design summer projects because students will be challenge. Students will want to take the least amount of time doing school work in the summer, so they will design a project that can get done fast with no effort. When teachers design summer projects they give enough work that will keep students learning throughout the whole break. For instance, teachers design summer projects with day by day sections, so students can not rush through it all in one day. To keep students working through the whole summer teachers are the best at designing summer projects.\n \n Some people may argue that summer projects should be student designed because it teaches students time management. Students need to be able to manage their time accordingly and experience critical thinking skills for future references. Despite these reasons, summer projects should be teacher designed because students tend to lose focus during big projects. Students being on summer break will result in them focusing on what is more fun rather than their school work. Teacher designed projects will assure that students are focused on getting the task done.\n \n Second, summer projects should be teacher designed because teachers have more experience. Teachers know students will wait until the last minute to try to come up with a quick project. Teachers will already have a summer project ready before summer break, so students will not have an excuse to why they could notÂ finish the project. Additionally, teachers already know what skills everyone struggles with. When returning back to school teachers will not have to struggle to reteach a skill. The topic that is chosen for students to complete over the summer will benefit students for the upcoming school year. Teachers designing summer projects will benefit the students more than students designing summer projects.\n \n In conclusion, summer projects should be teacher designed because students will be more challenged, teachers are more experienced, and students will not be focused. Students will try to get the easy way out if they are able to pick their own work. Teachers know what is best for students during their summer break. They can provide tips to help students along the way and assure students stay focused on their assignment. Teachers designing summer work will give students more time to enjoy summer rather than stressing over what to do as an summer assignment.",

If a teacher assigns a summer project with a specific topic that the student wouldn't want to talk about, would make the summer a bore.\n \n If the student chooses their topic it will be something they have interest in, therefore they will enjoy doing the project.

    essay: "Imagine being a student on summer break and still letting your teacher decide what project you are doing, would you want that? While some may say that teacher designed projects over the summer time are better, I disagree with that statement. Letting students make their own projects for summer lets them have more creativeness, it makes the project easier on them, and could lets them enjoy their projects a lot more since they dont have to follow some guidelines. I know I would want to have a student designed project especially since its summer time. When students get their own student designed project it lets them have more creativeness, easier projects, and lets them have more fun with their project.\n \n When a student gets to design his or her own project it lets them be creative which will lead to a better project. Creativeness leads to great things, something that is emphasized by almost every teacher. In addition, a student project that is designed by them is the science fair and some amazing projects come out of that every year. When you are stuck following guidelines their is not much to do with your project, when I had to make my own project I got an A+ on it. Creativeness leads to overall better projects, which teachers will like more.\n \n Students making there own project lets them have an easier time with the project. They know the own guidelines and rules since they designed the project. I know when I was in this situation I benefited a lot from letting me make my own guidelines to follow make the project easier for me to do. When the project is easier that gives me more motivation to do it, so all my time spent on the project is productive. Students benefit a lot when they are doing something that comes easy to them.\n \n While making your own project it lets you enjoy your time working on the project. Working on a project where you are having fun and enjoying yourself is a much better experience than just slugging it out. Their is a saying that \"time flies when you're having fun,\" that could apply to the project too. When Im having fun it leads to better results and a less amount of work time. Also, why would a teacher not want you to have fun while you're on summer break.\n \n Some could argue that teacher designed projects are better due to them being more structured and proper. Student designed projects are still the better option, when a student is creative it leads to an overall better project. They also have an easier time with the project, which leads to more motivation to do the project and get it over with. Also , actually enjoying the project leads to an overall better and less amount of work time.

    essay: "Some schools require students to complete projects over summer to assure they continue learning during the break. The school is thinking of adopting that rule and the principal is trying to decide if these summer projects should be designed by teachers or students. It would be best if the principal made these projects designed by teachers in order to make sure the projects are decently sized, factually correct, informative, and easy to understand and grade.\n \n Some people say that if students were to make the projects, the projects would be kept at a good size because the students know better than everyone else what would be a fair, challenging project and the teachers would make the project overly long or short. However, since teachers are designing the project, they will focus on making the project not overly large because making a longer project means more grading for the teachers, while also not making a overly brief project because it will fail to keep the students learning and informed over summer break. If the students were to make the project they might feel compelled to make the project short and easy for the sake of less work.\n \n Since the teachers are well informed on the subjects of the projects and know what the students need to learn or retain over summer break, they would be the best choice to make a project that is factually correct and informative. If students were to design these projects, they would be a greater chance of factual or grammatical error in the project, which is really damaging and will be hard for the teacher to reteach and correct.\n \n The teacher is in charge of giving out grades to students and will format their assignments and projects so they are easy to grade. If the students were to create the summer projects, the teachers would have to figure out a rubric to grade the projects and judge how much the project should weigh on the students' grade, which can take quiet a bit compared to if the teachers just made the projects themselves.\n \n The teachers are better at making sure the project for many reasons: they are better at formatting, they make less errors, and they'll make the project meatier than a student would. Think about this; what if you were assigned a summer project for science that was intended to keep you well informed, but was overly brief, wasn't as well formatted as it could have been, had a confusing or nonexistent rubric, and had potential factual or grammatical errors. Would you want the students to make the project for the sole reason that they're students or would you take the paid, professional teacher? In short, the principal should make the summer projects designed by teachers.",

    essay: "There are schools that sometimes encourage or require teachers to assign a project over summer break. This is beneficial because it keeps the student actively learning. Sometimes when students come back after having a long period of break, and if they did not kept actively learning, it can be difficult to get back on track. If schools were to assign summer projects for the students, I think that it would be more beneficial for the project to be student-designed, because students have more control over the level of difficulty, more creativeness, and it can motivate them to do it.\n \n When students have more control over the level of difficulty, they can decide how challenging the project should be. There are times when teachers have handed out activities, projects, or classwork where they can be a bit too challenging or stressful for some students. For example, I was once given an assignment in history, where I had to research a topic and then write five pages maximum. This was hard for me, because it was a big jump as to what I would usually write, and over time it just ended up stressing me and I felt as if I really did not gain much information out of it. However, when in another class we were given a year-long project that was student-designed, I learned so much more and had a better experience. Even though we did also make the project challenging, it was not too overwhelming for al. We had a better opinion as to how much we were capable of without it becoming overwhelming and stressful. When students decide how challenging the project should be for them, it can help them learn better and actually apply the new learned knowledge, compared to when teachers decide.\n \n If projects were student-designed, the students have a better chance of being more creative and expressing better. Nobody really likes to do tasks that are boring for them, or where their creativity is tight. I once had a science project where I was allowed to be creative, and since that was the case I not only learned and understood the information better, but my grade improved as well. There are many times, that I have proved that when the projects were created by the students, students learned much more because they liked it and they could express themselves better. Sometimes when teachers limit their students, it can become very stressful an unpleasantÂ for the students. Not many can successfully learn and grow in an environment like that.\n \n Summer break is supposed to be fun vacations and a stress-free time period; yet, it students should still be actively learning during the break. However, if projects are assigned, then students should be allowed to create them themselves in order to make them more fun. When projects, or even simple task can be made in a fun way, it can be less stressful and more enjoyable. That way, many more students would be more motivated to actually do the project and put effort into it. When there is motivation, and things are done thoroughly, the ending results tend to reflect that. For example, when students have to study for a test, and they are given study guidesÂ with just questions it really does not help motivate some students to study. Unlike when students who use different study tools, such as games or more interactive activities, this makes the task more fun and wanting to put effort.\n \n When projects are fun and more creative, students can learn, understand, and apply the information better. Learning over the break can also be helpful so when returning back to school, they have retained the old information, yet have learned new one too. I think that projects that are student-designed are more successful than teacher-designed projects, because students can decide the level of difficulty fit for them, there is more creativeness, and it can be more effective and motivational.Â",

More time goes by, one month, then the next. Now its four days before the first day of school and you're laying in bed thinking \"oh this is bad\". This happens to students almost everywhere you look on earth, Massive procrastination that doesn't end until its too late. How do we curb this? I believe the best option is the Teacher Designed Summer Project, TDSP for short, and here's why.\n \n My First reason for thinking the TDSP is better than the SDSP(student designed summer project) is that students can be just flat out lazy. Using myself as an example, I am a very lazy student. I dont turn things in on time, whenever I do turn things in on time normally they're haphazardly put together and not very cohesive. I know that if our school were to have a SDSP many students, myself included, would not get them done because we believe we have many better things that we could be doing with our time, or we just do not want to do it. If these projects were headed up by a teacher, it would help direct the many students like me.\n \n My next reason on why the TSDP is better is that many students dont know what they want to do with their life once they leave high school. With the help of a specialized TDSP teacher and or counselor, the students can be lead to something that they genuinely enjoy, instead of something that makes them want to pull their hair out every day. A specialized TSDP teacher would know their students and their aspirations in life and can help them form ideas and keep them on the right track through the three months.\n \n My final point on why the TDSP is better, which tacks onto my last point, is that it could encourage kids to pursue something that they love and take charge of their future. With the help of a TDSP teacher, students like me could start to find a calling in life, something that we genuinelyÂ enjoy and want to keep doing. That's not something that would happen with students like me if we had no direction.\n \n There are some drawbacks to the TDSP however. The first reason would be it might put more stress on the students in a time where we are supposed to be relaxing from school work to take time for ourselves. The second drawback is that it would put more strain on the school system to pay certain TDSP teachers through the summer, and it would also take precious summer time away from those said TDSP teachers. The third drawback would be that it is catered towards people who are somewhat lazy, restricting the students that are not to a bound path.\n \n It's hard for me to admit that, being one of the students that believes that summer projects are horrible, I still believe that the teacher lead summer project is the best route to go. It keeps students on track with the school, you form a tighter bond with aÂ teacher, and you start to figure out what you want to do on this big blue sphere. Many students will not like it at first, and they wont want to give it the light of day, But they'll cone around. It pains me to say that, even though it would be taking away from my precious summer time, I believe that the Pros of the TDSP out way the cons and that it might just be the solution to our problems.Â  Â  Â",

    essay: "During the summer, students receive projects to ensure that they continue to learn outside of school. Usually there is a strict rubric to follow, but many people argue that it would be more beneficial if they were able to design their own project. As a student, I believe that having more freedom with our summer projects would bring out our work ethic. People don't often respond well to a list of rules they are told they must follow. We would be a lot more receptive to things made for and by us. Students would have an easier and better time with a project where they are not limited and can express their creativity .However, some people might prefer having a teacher-designed project over a student-designed project, because it tells them exactly what to do and how to do it. I understand that to a degree, but outside of doing projects that's how everything else is. Worksheets, quizzes, and tests are all rule driven. We don't get to choose how we want to do them, because they are already made a certain way. In my opinion, it doesn't leave much to the imagination which is one of the most important parts of doing a project.Â When we are put in a box it takes the enjoyment out of the project, and we don't try as hard.\n \n I have done many summer projects over the past couple of years, and I have noticed that the projects with the most rules and standards were the ones I worked on last minute. I did not find them interesting, because I was forced to do exactly what the paper said. I personally enjoy having to come up with my own themes, and using whatever material or format that I wish to use at the time. One of the best parts of a project is the design. We get to make it look the way we want it. Unlike regular school work we can pick the color, the fonts, and the format. During the 9 months we are in school we are required to do work we don't necessarily want to do. Summer is our time to relax, and if we are still needed to do this work than it should be something we want to do. Expression is a big thing for my age group. If you make a project more expression and creativity based, kids will automatically be more drawn to it. I definitely was during my last project.\n \n I attend the Center for the Arts program at Generic_School and one of the most creative projects I've ever done was for my Musical Theater class last year. We had to make a video or a PowerPoint about ourselves and present it for the rest of class. I made a PowerPoint that included some special things in my life, like my best friend and also included some videos or us joking around. I really loved that project, because everyone had a different presentation. No two were the same. We all learned new things about each other, and that's how some of us became friends. We found out each others interests and what we had in common. One kid in my class even wrote a song about himself and preformed it for us. We all had the chance to express ourselves, which made the project so exciting. Creativity is very important to me, especially in my program.\n \n It would be really beneficial if we gave other kids, outside of the center, this opportunity as well. It challenges them and shows how creative everyone can be.\n \n Another downside to teacher-designed project is that teachers often use some of the same projects over again. For example; I have done the same summer project for my English classes for the past two or three years. We were required to read three books and write excerpts about each. It wasn't a difficult endeavor, but it would've been so much more enjoyable to make a video or a presentation about the book rather than a quick summary. We also didn't get to pick the books we were given. The first year, I was lucky enough to have received\n \n The Outsiders which is now my favorite book. However, the year after, I was given\n \n Animal Farm which\n \n I did not find interest in at all. The rest of my class tended to agree with me. Overall I think that was not a good book to give to our age group. Usually it is a hit or miss when it comes to the book you are given, because not everyone has the same interests. For example; last summer we received\n \n The Secret Life of Bees and I absolutely loved it, but some other students in my class found it to be derivative and boring. Thats where our individuality comes in. We all differ in our interests and it's hard to find something that everyone has in common.\n \n I find myself enjoying projects more than normal school work because of the control I have over them. If you take away that aspect, there is really no point of doing the project instead of a regular worksheet. Recently we have been given lots of projects in English class that made up for the repeated summer work. We were lucky enough for the new projects to have been mostly student-based and student-taught. The most recent project was a student-teacher assignment. We received a topic and had to come up with a lesson plan to teach the rest of our class. I had to teach about active and passive voice. I taught a short lesson on what it was, and then I gave out a timed worksheet. The first person who finished and got them all correct received a prize. We also got to grade the class on how well they did, like a teacher would. The assignment wasn't necessarilyÂ about how well you did teaching, but it was about how well the class took in the information you taught. That project was really enjoyable. It was really creative and way more interesting than if we were given a specific sheet to follow like we would usually get.\n \n In conclusion, Students would be way more receptive to a student-designed project than a teacher-designed project. They would get the opportunity to express themselves and show what they are really capable of. Everyone is creative and they should get the chance to showcase that to themselves, their teachers, and their classmates. Hopefully in the future, we will get more of a chance to express ourselves through our work and get opportunities to be creative.Â",

    essay: "In all reality I feel that if a school system wants a childs brain to blossom with ideas and learn how to be creative then the teachers should let the students design their own project for example; when I was younger I had to do a project for school and I did not like the reading project that was assigned it didnt let my creativity flow and I couldnt get into the book. Kids like to explore and find new things to do. Let a kid be a kid dont assign them something they would not find fun over the summer.\n \n I would like to begin with, when i was young and iÂ had to do a reading assignment over summer i didnt do it because it wasnt what i craved and wanted to do,i wanted to be a explorer and find new things and played in the mud. I went around and tried to find things that interested me and I started to collect bugs and tried to find out what they was and when i went back to school i told my teacher that i collected bugs and found out the names of them and iÂ proceed to ask her if i could write a essay since i did not do the reading project and she let me do the essay about bugs. so my creativity was able to flow out and i found out something that i enjoyed doing that i did not know liked doing.\n \n In addition to, children like to find stuff to do and not realize it could be bad and not understand the out comeÂ so let a kid be a kid and be creative so they can explore their minds and find something they enjoy doing and summer is about having fun and hanging out with your friends and family. I think kids do not do the assignments that are assigned to them because they do not find it interesting, a kid need to find something interesting in order to want to do it. If they can not design their projects for summer then they should not have to do them, i feel that when a child has the opportunity to do something that they find creative then they will end up doing it.\n \n To end with, summer is all about taking a break from school and being free teachers should not assign projects to students they should not feel like they are forced to do something when they can let their mind explore and learn new thing on their own. If a teacher just gives out a project and is like here do this over summer then the student might not find it interesting and not do it. If students are able to design their own projects and be them self then their minds can bloom into some beautiful and amazing they will find out a new part of them self that they never knew they had.\n \n In conclusion, a student should be able to design their own project so they can discover more about them self that they never knew existed. When It comes to teachers giving out summer projects i can see why some students may not complete it because they could find it boring or they just arent interested in doing it, thats why i think summer projects should be student designed and they should be forced to do a project that they dont find interesting. So if school assign summer projects let the students design the project and see what type of response you get back. Remember summer isnt about doing work its about being able to have fun with family and friends.Â",

    essay: "Although summer is considered as a break from school, it is a rather perfect opportunity for students to continue working on assignments in orderÂ to keep the ideas they learned over the course of the year fresh in their minds before they head back. To do this, many schools are adopting mandatory summer projects for students to complete before their next school year will begin. These projects will stimulate critical thinking and sharpen the skills that students have learned in their previous year. Although many parents think that teachers know the capabilities of their student, which is why they should be the ones to design it, it should be student designed because students are more likely to understand their peers' schedule and difficulties in the content; by making them student designed, these projects will successfully, and efficiently, accomplish their purpose.\n \n Even though many teachers claim that they are very close with their students, in truth, they do not know much about what their students do. During the summer, aside from going on family vacations and other recreational activities, many students have responsibilities like volunteer work, internships, jobs, taking care of siblings, and etc. that take up a lot of time out of their day. Teachers do not know a student's life outside of academics and will therefore not consider these aspects of their life. As a result, teachers will most likely design a project that could be very time consuming and strenuous for students. However, if the project is student-designed, it would be designed knowing that students have other responsibilities outside of of academics. With the schedule of a student in mind, the project will be designed in a way that will be evenly spread out content wise, with enough time to complete each assignment.\n \n Although teachers argue that they have taught for many years and they know the weak pointsÂ students have for certain topics, they are all basing it off of statistics. Just because students on average found a certain topic difficult does not mean that all will; and some will find a different one difficult. By gathering a group students, the students will be able to pin point which topics are easy and which will require more explaining.Â Additionally even if teachers were able to successfully identify which topics are troublesome for students, they will not be able to solve the issue present in the most simplest way. Recently the demand for tutors is growing and the reason is that is many of these tutors are young. They have only recently finished their studies. But most importantly, their age gap between their tutees, the students that tutors help,Â isÂ a measly couple of years, compared to the decades of years between students and teachers. Because of this minuscule age gap, these tutors understand a student's difficulties better. They have gone through the problems that their tuteeÂ is going through very recently. As result of this, unlike teachers who will provide a lengthy explanation that was told to them by their professors many years prior, tutors will explain how to solve these problems moreÂ efficientlyÂ and accurately. Similarly, that is why students, knowing where their peers' difficulties lay, will be able to able to create assignments that are specifically targeted towards students and their success in the content.\n \n With these summer projects, students will successfully master their acquired skills from the previous year and get a head startÂ in their studies for their year to come. Due to this, students will face a smooth transition from their prior grade to their next. Additionally, by making these projects student designed, the projects will not interfere in their day to day activities during the summer and will provide assignments that will efficiently target students' weak areas and strengthen them. Both of these goals will be met by including enough time each assignment and including easy to follow videos, created by students, explaining difficult topics.Â  Â Â Â",

    essay: "Have you ever had to do a project during the summer break? In some schools, they may require that you do a few projects in order to maintain what you have learned, usually being designed by the teachers, which may not work with most students. Instead, the students should design the projects as they know more what works for them educationally and they know how to adjust the project to their schedule.\n \n Oftentimes, not all students learn content in the same ways; some students may be visual learners whereas others are more lecture based learners. This also extends to projects, where certain student excel better at certain categories, such as a music student being more effective at making music for a video project. Oftentimes in projects when a student can't effectively do a project, they get a lower grade, which lowers their average Grade Point Average alongside other things simply because they do not work well with the specific subject of the project. Because of this fact, students should design their projects as they know how they work as well as how the learn. Not only does a student designed project allow for the student to be more effective at completing it, it gives the students a greater interest in the topic, allowing both increased creative drive as well as increased motivation to complete the project.\n \n When it comes to projects and deadlines, schools oftentimes roll out standards and assessments that don't take into account how the individual student would be able to effectively abide my them. In many cases there are students who are unable to complete assignments and attend events because of complications in their life that they can't control, such as, but not limited to: Needing to work to support their family, needing to care for a family member, having to travel to another country or place because of their family, and many more. In cases such as that, the projects and assignments set by the school, which are often based on the assumption that students do not possess any tasks beyond school, are simply hard if not impossible to complete for those students. If the students would be able to make their projects, then they can design them to fit alongside their life, making it so that they are more capable of accomplishing them. Alongside making it better for the students, it could help increase the high school graduation rate as many students drop out of high school because they are unable to complete their education.\n \n In discussions of this topic, some may say that the students don't know what they need to do for the projects so they can't make them. This argument, however, is invalid for quite a few reasons. Firstly, the students know what the course that they took in the passing school year contained. As they know what the year contained, they can make their projects cover those topics. Secondly, the students don't need to design the project solely by themselves. The teachers of the respective course could be of assistance by providing a checklist of sorts to assist the students in making the project. Thirdly, the teachers who design projects often make them in a sweeping manner, which as been explained earlier doesn't work with all students.\n \n In conclusion, summer projects that schools require should be made by students for a couple of reasons. These include the fact that students can adjust the project to fit their learning alongside that they can adjust it to better align with their life. For those reasons, schools should allow students to make their own summer projects.",

    essay: "During the school year students dream about the summer ,but neglect the summer project that is assigned. For many years, teachers have assigned a summer project for students to do. Most students completely forget about the project. They don't have motivation to start or finish the project because it's not in their interest. Some believe that summer projects should be teacher-designed. Although some may disagree, summer projects should be student-designed.\n \n A reason why projects should be student oriented is that students become more expressive in their summer project. Students become more creative when projects feel less like a chore. I could program a game or website over the summer to show my creativity. As wellÂ this allows the student to think outside of the box. Another reason is students will be more diverse in their project. No one will have the same project. This allows the teacher to go in depthÂ with grading to give a more accurate grade. Many peers can learn something new from each others project rather than all learning the same thing. I would make a project to why the military is very beneficial. However, one student might think civilian life is better. We could discuss to each other our views. Furthermore, students will have more motive to complete their project. I always put aside the summer school project. It's never fun to do work that doesn't interest you. This allows for the percentage of students completing their project to rise.\n \n Student designed projects allows students to find new interests. Doing a project on something you learned already makes it feel repetitive. I personally wasn't all about NJROTC until I started to come to practice more ,and this opened a new array of options for me after high school. This allows the students to be more geared to learn new things such as: building a computer, time management during the school year, and budgeting. Additionally, another reason why projects should be student oriented is cheating will decrease among projects. If the teacher assigns the same projects people can easily cheat off each other. During the summer, I have been asked multiple times from friends if they could copy off my project. If I were to do my own project they couldn't copy off of me. Students can learn more information from doing the project themselves. This also shows the skill level of students. Finally, students have more freedom to do their project. This allows them to express their ideas. I love to have freedom it allows me to have a sense of free will. This allows most to make the project to feel a lotÂ less like a project ,and more of a fun activity to do.\n \n Although some may disagree, summer projects should be student-designed. The reason I believe this is expressing yourself, diversity, more motive to complete the project, finding new interests, cheating will decrease, and more freedom. Although, some believe that summer projects should be teacher-designed. Ultimately, students should have the right to choose what they want to do in their project since it's their project.",

    essay: "When the school year is completed and time for summer vacation, students tend to forget material worth of nine months in a break. Many classes, such as AP or honors require upcoming students to complete summer assignments in two months. When there are no assignments to complete, many individuals take the time to hang out with friends or spend most of the time on technology. With the continuous use of games and social media on a daily basis, school habits such as grammar is modified in a student. Teachers try to prevent the overuse in technology to assure that children are obtaining the correct information on what is being learned. The assignments that teachers provide in the summer is beneficial, because it allows students to continue to learn core subjects which keeps the brain active. Teacher-designed projects allow students to become familiar with the curriculum, focuses on quality, and an understanding of the new group of students in the subject.\n \n Teachers provide summer assignments to introduce what the curriculum focuses on to students. Some teachers acknowledge what needs to be taught in the next school year, so many provide assignments that relate to what will be covered during the school year. Multiple classes, such as, AP Lang and Composition summer project focused on rhetorical literary devices which is learned throughout the school year when writing a rhetorical analysis. Comparing to if the project was student-designed, it would be challenging to understand what needs to be learned if there are no guidelines to follow. Student would have to assume what would be part of the curriculum and not comprehending the correct materials of what should be learned. If the project is designed by the teacher, it allows students to indicate what information may be taught in the upcoming school year.\n \n Character plays an important role to first impressions on the first day of school. When teachers assign projects over the summer, it allows students to approach the assignment as best see fit. Some students may go above and beyond while others may do the opposite. By looking at how students completed the summer project, it allows teachers to comprehend what type of person one may be such specific word choice. The project could be viewed at how artistic and creative it was, or it could be presented on how the student's word choice and the way it was formatted. Some teachers provide projects to get an understanding of the new group of students that will be attending the class. A teacher may provide a guideline to assist with the project, however, if the project was student-designed, some students may not do the assignment which could lead to a bad first impression.\n \n Typically, what is essential to projects and assignments is the amount of quality and effort that is put in. When teachers assign a project, usually, students add effort and quality into what is being presented. If there is a rubric to follow, then the quality of the project should be well-represented towards the student. However, if there was no rubric to follow, then the quality of \"excellent\" could potentially be different in the teachers perspective. When there is a guideline, such as a rubric, it advocates students on how the teacher best sees' the highest grading point to the lowest.\n \n For example, students that add effort to the summer project, will lead to the quality of the product in a presentable way. If the summer assignment was student-designed, then many might not provide the quality and effort which results in a bad representation. The more effort put in, the better the quality the summer assignment will be.\n \n Many schools provide students to complete summer assignments and projects to be aware that individuals are still learning during the break. Teachers try to make sure that children are gaining knowledge by making activities for the brain to still be active. Teachers that assign projects over the summer is beneficial because it allows students to still be in the habit of learning school skills such as grammar. Proctor-designed projects allow students to become familiar with the curriculum, focuses on quality, and an understanding of the new group of individuals in the subject. As a result, summer assignments should be teacher designed.Â",

    essay: "Summer is the longest break students get. Every kid loves the hot summers and playing outside. The only downside to summer is the fact that most kids forget a lot of what they learned throughout the school year. Majority of kids are more focused on having a fun summer than they are on retaining their knowledge, which is why summer projects were created. Although, some students take no breaks from their education, teachers should be the ones designing the students' summer projects so those children can continue learning during break.\n \n A protruding factor that supports the position that teachers should plan the summer projects for students is that the teachers are the masters of what they are teaching. Teachers go to school to study and learn about the subject they are teaching so they know more about it than the students do. For example, a teacher goes to school for four years to study physics and teaching. Then, they go on to teach that subject to students. Since they have a degree in those areas of studies that proves their credibility to them knowing what they are doing. While some students may be well educated on a subject, a teacher has a degree, which shows they hold superior knowledge and really know how to get a student to learn a subject the right way. Therefore, teacher's should design student summer projects.\n \n Another prime point to key in on is the fact that teachers are more experienced than the students by a large margin. Most teacher's have been educators for years, and even if they have not, they have been in the field for years. Becoming a teacher is something that takes time. What has to be kept in mind is that they once were students too, so they know what is best to do or give to help their students continue learning. My aunt, for example, studied mathematics for four years in college and is now a math teacher at a high schoolÂ nearby. She knows what is best to do for her students to learn because she once had to learn it all too. Although students have experience in the learning field, teachers are more experienced and know what is the best way to design a project for students to continue learning even through breaks.\n \n One under mindedÂ factor that should be considered when determining whether teachers should design the summer project is the level of maturity teachers hold compared to students. Teachers are much older than their students, as a result, they are more experienced in the world, which makes them more mature. For example, if I were given the opportunity to make my own summer project, I would make it as short and easy as possible. This shows my immaturity as a kid because i want to spend as little time learning in the summer as possible and use the rest of that time to have fun. My math teacher on the other hand, realizes that summer is long and if the students do not do any math over the summer, then they will forget a lot. To prevent that, she gives out lengthy math packets so her students can continue learning. This shows her maturity in her realization of how important it is for a student to continue learning even through breaks. While some students may be mature, teachers are more mature than the majority of their students. Thus, teachers should be given the responsibility of designing summer projects.\n \n Even though some students are serious learners day in and day out, teachers should be the ones planning out the summer projects for students. Children are focused more on having fun than they are on furthering their education during any break. Summer is no exception, for some it is a resting time, but for most it is an opportunity to slack off on their education. Teachers know how to keep the kids learning, nevertheless, the teachers should do the teaching and the students should do the learning.Â",

These are national student organizations that are simply supervised by school officials but headed by the students. These clubs do operate year round which is what makes it great for summer projects. These clubs prepare students for post secondary life and provide educational and real world skills in a variety of subjects students could be interested in.

These organizations are also competitive with certain subject areas which also encourages skills like studying, or hands on skills such as demonstrating or teaching. In the TV show Degrassi, a group of high school juniors come together to do a project over break for their school. This project had consisted of research on the history of their community and how to make it better. To do this project, they needed to gather information, use teamwork, utilize critical thinking skills, and present in front of the school board. In a similar manner to the organizations already mentioned, they also gained valuable skills of leadership, managing, and teaching. While it was directly related to their school, unlike FCCLA and DECA. They also shared the skills of motivation and organization with FCCLA and DECA but they took a different approach.\n \n There are many ways to have a productive, educational, and fun summer project for schools everywhere. It all starts with students designing their projects to build independent skills and choosing to work on something that is interesting to them. While teacher designed projects will help them with their current school and build skills for the academic side of their future which is important, they are more for the immediate. Students now are the future, therefore these reasons listed are why they must be designed by the students. Giving students a path to becoming better and more successful citizens. Â Â Â Â Â Â",

In the TV show Degrassi, a group of high school juniors come together to do a project over break for their school. This project had consisted of research on the history of their community and how to make it better. To do this project, they needed to gather information, use teamwork, utilize critical thinking skills, and present in front of the school board. In a similar manner to the organizations already mentioned, they also gained valuable skills of leadership, managing, and teaching. While it was directly related to their school, unlike FCCLA and DECA. They also shared the skills of motivation and organization with FCCLA and DECA but they took a different approach.\n \n There are many ways to have a productive, educational, and fun summer project for schools everywhere. It all starts with students designing their projects to build independent skills and choosing to work on something that is interesting to them. While teacher designed projects will help them with their current school and build skills for the academic side of their future which is important, they are more for the immediate. Students now are the future, therefore these reasons listed are why they must be designed by the students. Giving students a path to becoming better and more successful citizens. Â Â Â Â Â Â",

    essay: "Most students dislike summer assignments, could that change if they desgined the assignment themselves? Summer assignments can be a chore that students are unhappily forced to complete. I believe that if students could design their own summer projects they would be more willing to complete it because it promotes creativity, gives them control over how they do their project, and gives it an overall feeling that its not just another boring assignment.\n \n Others could say that without direction students wouldn't know what to do. However; without that direction students can have full creativity over what they do. From multiple tests i've seen, when a student is allowed to work how they want their creativity and willingness to work increases tenfold. Given the opportunity to be creative on their own, students can and will be more productive and willing to complete an assignment.\n \n No one likes to be told what to do, this is all the same for students. If students are given control over how they work on projects and assignments they are much more productive. The freedom a student can feel when given control over a project will only encourage them to continue learning throughout the summer.\n \n School can be a boring and repetitive place for students, multiple assignments all feeling the same can wear them down. When summer rolls around its a breathe of relief, until they realize there is still more learning to do. If students designed their own project however, that could all change and very well could be excited to actually continue learning throughout the summer.\n \n In conclusion, students dislike assignments, especially during the summer. But if a student was allowed to design and create it themselves it would not only promote creativity, give them control over the project allowing them to not feel chained to the rules, and give them the mindset that they are not just completing another assignment.

    essay: "During school, students are constantly testing their knowledge by learning new things, but throughout summer break when school is not in session, students often forget what they were taught during the school year. Most projects assigned to students are teacher-designed, even though a student-designed project would be more beneficial towards their education.\n \n Although a teacher-designed summer project serves as a guideline for topics the student should focus on, student-designed summer projects are more efficient because they teach students to be more creative, help the students decide a method that could help them remember what they learned during the school year, and allows the student to work at their own pace without stress.\n \n When learning something new, creativity plays a significant part in success. Students who apply their creativity to a project are more likely to enjoy and learn from their assignment rather than those who choose not to. For example, if a student was given a writing assignment and allowed to write whatever they desire, the student's interest would spark and their creativity would show. Another example is if students worked on project in groups; The group members would be allowed to combine their creativity to create a successful piece.\n \n Decision-making is a key component to life, therefore students should be allowed to make their own decisions when it comes to creating a project. For example, if a student was asked to do a book report by their English teacher, the student should be allowed to decide how they would like to present. This method helps the student learn because they are incorporating their own methods and decisions. By doing this, the student is incorporating their learning capabilities into a work of their own, thus allowing them to successfully learn the topic.\n \n Learning at another's pace rather than oneself is an inefficient way to learn new information. Therefore, a teacher incorporating their way of working into a project is unacceptable for a student's learning process. For example, a student who is given homework should be able to complete it without a deadline because the student would be working at their own pace and learn from what they are practicing rather than stressing about the deadline. Also, when stress is involved in learning, students are less likely to complete their assigments because they will have anxiety attempting to start.\n \n In conclusion, student-designed summer projects are more efficient beacuse they teach students to be more creative, help the students decide a method that could help them remember what they learned during the school year, and allow the student to work at their own pace to prevent stress. Teachers should allow students to design their own projects because it motivates them to learn how they want to learn. If teacher-designed projects continue to be incorporated, students will be less likely to complete their projects while learning new topics.Â",

    essay: "Everyone loves the summer, but the one thing that students do not look forward to, is summer projects. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because students will procrastinate when choosing the project, students will make the project too easy, and teachers are more experienced than students.\n \n School can be very stressful for a student, but that might not always fall on the teacher. Students tend to make things harder for themselves by waiting at the last minute to complete assignments, especially when they are given more freedom on the project. Summer is the best time of the year for a student and they do not want to spend that time thinking of what topic or project they should choose. Students will procrastinate and wait to the very last minute to come up and complete their assignment. If a teacher picked the assignment, they can give students the tools and structure they need to make an A+ worthy project.\n \n Right after the final bell to signal the start of summer, a student earns a sense of freedom and accomplishment. Summer is the time where students want to sit back, relax, and soak it all in. That's why if the summer project was designed by a student, the project would be way too easy. In the summer, all students want is the time to be young. To go out with friends and enjoy a warm summer night. But having a summer project to come up with gets in the way of that time. Students would want to get back to that time as soon as possible. Therefore, the students would make a project so easy that it would in no way benefit them. Students will find a way to make the easiest, and least time consuming activity for a project. Teachers, however can design a project with the right difficulty to help a student move forward with their learning, while also insuring the best summer vacation possible for the students.\n \n During the 182 day school year teachers have a lot of projects and assignments to come up with. That's why when designing a summer project, teachers are the perfect people for the job. Students aren't as experienced as teachers when it comes to coming up with a project. Teachers make many projects over the course of the school year and they most likely have gotten the formula down by the time summer comes to a start. Teachers know how to structure and execute a project to help students learn to their fullest potential.\n \n In conclusion summer projects should be designed by teachers because teachers have a better ability to structure a project, students will tend to procrastinate when given freedom on a project, and students will limit themselves by making the project way too easy. At the end of the day, summer projects are made to help students maintain their ability to learn over the summer and I believe that teachers are the people best suited to help students grow during their summer vacation.",

There shouldn't be student designed project because they will most likely forget about it or throw something together for a project.\n \n Firstly , The teachers will know about how the project is supposed to be done. They will know mostly know everything about the project. The teacher will inform the students before they would leave for summer break about the project. The teacher will give examples of the projects about how they are supposed too, and how they don't supposed to look. They will give you details on how you can make your project better. The teacher will hand you out a syllabus on what you need for your project.\n \n Then, The teachers will have a project dealing with the upcoming classes of your semester . The teachers will help them grow in knowledge and in the world. There will be a earlier learning start for students because, They've already worked on it in the summer. The teachers will cover all classes the student have for the upcoming school year.

    essay: "Planning a summer project can be a difficult task for anyone. However, for school summer projects, teachers should be the ones to plan out a summer project for the students. Teacher's have been proven to more knowledgeable then their younger counterparts. Teachers are just overall more knowledgeable about how to teach their students.\n \n In order for teachers to better prepare their students for their class; a summer project is best left to the teachers to plan out. The reason being that teachers should have a pretty good idea of they should be teaching for that year's education. Centering the project on what teachers will be teaching; would better help understand where their students stand on certain subjects of that class. Not to mention, teachers also have more experience in what students should be learning because at one point they were students themselves.\n \n Being a teacher most certainly means that teachers have gone through learning experiences that they thought had gone well, or maybe had thought classes could have been taught using better methods. Teachers can then apply what they have learned from previous learning experiences ,and either take or improve uponÂ them.\n \n Then, we have the most obvious reason why student shouldn't come up with their own summer projects. Student have time and again proven that they push off or be become lazy doing certain tasks. This may not be the case for all student, however it is the majority. Another reason why students may not be able or be good at planning projects, is because they may be simply to busy doing other activities. Some example of these activities are sports, having a job, visiting collages, or planning out what they want to do for a career. Students may just simply not have enough time to plan out what they want to do for a project; where as for a teacher. It is their job to plan out what students should be doing in or for their classes.\n \n Those are the reasons on why teachers are better equipped to plan out summer projects and not students. Teacher's can pull from previous learning experiences to apply to how they want to teach students. Students could outright just be lazy or to busy to plan out assignments. Then the obvious fact that teachers have just learned more ways because they are older.",

    essay: "Have you ever imagined allowing students design their own summer projects? Would allowing them be beneficial to their learning? Many strongly believe that if students were to design their own assignments it would give them more motivation, but if anything it is not educationally helping them. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because students would not actually do their assignments, the teachers know exactly what they want their students to learn during the summer, and it's an efficient way for teachers to prepare their students for the upcoming school year.\n \n Many students always have a way of getting their teachers to allow them come up with class assignments but that is not always the best thing to do. If it is up to them to create what they need for the summer, they will not be productive. They can create something that they think is so much fun compared to the things their teacher gives them, but it could be something completely different to the subject their work should be about. All teachers know what every single one of theirÂ students need to improve on; they create assignments based on certain subjects an individual or the whole class needs help on, so that it does not become a huge issue when entering the following school year. I mean don't get me wrong, teachers understand that the work they hand out to their students can't always be boring and when it is time to create the students assignments they should include some interesting activities for them to accomplish. Perhaps allowing them to create summer work is in some ways practically, but it is a distraction in the sense of it could take them all summer to settle down on a project they want and if that was the case then they would have wasted their whole summer of learning in just thinking about a project they want rather than simply just getting their work from their teachers. Certain people do have their own opinions, but what we always need to do is put our students education first.\n \n This should be viewed as a great opportunity teachers have for preparing their students for the upcoming school year. A strong number of people whether it's parents, teachers from different schools, or just friends don't believe that giving their kids summer work does prepare them for the next school year. In my past summers I remember that there wasn't a time where i did not have some sort of assignments to work on and I remember I always understood the first few subjects we were learned and that was because all the assignments I worked on actually helped me when school started. Many of my friends always tell me how one simple assignment did so much for them. I would always be lost and understand the new material from the very beginning. One simple project, work book, or even a packet of a certain subject can take a student so far, allowing students to feel more at ease and also allowing them to get amazing grades from the first few weeks of school. More so, it is a beneficial way to have more students succeed when testing time roles around at the end of the year. There has been a great amount of students who do strongly agree with summer projects being teacher-designed simply because they realize how remarkable the finishing results are.\n \n When thinking of a subject like this a number of questions run through my head like, \" Would the students or I truly create something so efficient to our learning just by instructionsÂ given to us from our teachers that try to explain what we need? \". Going back to the issue on students completely misinterpreting their expectations; not all kids can come up with an assignment that covers the details they need to work on. From personal experiences there has been multiple times where my teacher allowed us to make our own projects that should cover all our subject units, but I completely failed because i would think I was doing it all correct and when it came to the due date and test time I would fail. This is just an inefficient way, especially if you want your students to actually do great in your class. I mean it also makes it so much harder for the students to recover and catch up or having to bring up their grades. In the end it's all about assuring your students will be outstanding throughout the whole school year in everything they do.\n \n Student-designed summer projects might have a nice sound to it, but a students future should be in consideration. All these summer assignments should be teacher-designed simply because students will not complete their tasks, all teachers know the work their students need to improve on, and it's an efficient way for teachers to prepare their students for the following school year, so that it does not hit them all at once. Students could go through a great amount of stress if it were up to them and that could all end in a horrendous way, which is why it is not a great idea to allow them to create their summer work.Â Â",

Summer is a time for fun and relaxation but that also doesn'tÂ mean that they should forget everything they learned. Student's should keep exercising their brains to make sure they are successful for their next year of school. Most school's require students to complete summer projects. Student's usually come up with summer projects due to the fact that it's summer which creates a lotÂ of opportunities for student's to come up with their own unique design. Teachers should be designing their summer projects because they have more experience in the field of learning and life as a whole.\n \n Teachers have to learn a subject to be able to teach a subject, they all have extensive knowledge in the area of studies and learning.

As you can see they have to prove their knowledge before they can get accepted. Therefore, I think they would have a better understanding on how a project should be designed for a student over the summer.

Since they're already teaching student's why can't they teach them over the summer as wellÂ through designing their projects.\n \n Teachers are generally much older than student's so they've experienced things students have not.

However most schools require their students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning over break. These summer projects should be student-designed because fellow students will be able to understand their peers struggles and interests, connect with a project that is designed for them, and learn more from topics and examples that interest them.\n \n Fellow students have a much better understanding and knowledge to what students are interested in, as well as things they may struggle with. Their peers would be able to design a project that they know their friends will enjoy. A student-designed project will help prevent a student from not being able to complete the assignment. For example if a teacher where to assign an online web quest but didntÂ know that some students did not have access to the internet, a fellow peer would see that issue in their school and know to create a project to be submitted by paper. it is also well known that if something does not interest a student they probably would not want to complete it. A project created by a peer would help grab their attention, make connections, and get them excited to complete it.\n \n Being able to connect with an assignment is very important for a students drive and interest in a project. If a student can connect to their assignment they will be more excited to complete it. A fellow student will be able to better connect a project to the current trends and interests. This will boost a students confidence and not make them dread doing work over the summer. A summer assignment should not feel like work; if a student connects to it and enjoys the topic then it will feel less like extra work that they have to do over their summer vacations'. When a student connects to a topic this will make them eager to learn more about the project.\n \n When a topic interests some one they are more likely to want to learn more about it. If a student was to design a project that interests their peers it will help them learn more and get more take away from an assignment, which is the whole point of an summer project. Parents and teachers want their students to continue to learn over the summer, so when a student has an assignment that they actually want to do they are more likely to benefit and learn from it even with out noticing that they are learning.\n \n Students obviously dont want to have to do work over the summer. So summer assignments need to be fun hands on and include topics that students enjoy and connect to. This will helpÂ students be engaged and continue their education while school in not in session; which is exactly what parents and teachers want!

    essay: "The Summer Project\n \n Summer projects are often popular to help assure that students are still learning throughout their break. What many people can not agree on is whether they should be student or teacher designed. Either way it is still providing knowledge to be gained during this time period, but by students designing them a better outcome should be seen overall.\n \n As seen so many times before, kids do not want to do school work in the summer; which is why they are typically so excited for break. Allowing them to create their own project leaves room for creativity and imagination. Creativity is put into place because they can take whatever they want , with some guidelines from the teacher of course, and turn it into something nobody has ever seen before. The internet is so handy and has the answers to almost everything now, children can just look up ways to do the project if teachers design it. Therefore, they are not really learning anything, just changing some things around enough in another's work, so that it is not plagiarism.\n \n Summer plans could get in the way as well. Some kids go away all summer or are working, as well as playing sports. With this being their time to relax they are not going to want to do a project that they did not come up with or might not be interested in. If they do create it, they can make it about their summer or something to do within their summer plans. That way, it is not such an inconvenience. With the project being more wrapped into their summer it could also make it easier for them, provide better grades, as well as the understanding of a subject.\n \n Teachers have specific curriculum that they have to teach every year. Depending on how their schedules are laid out. Such as, class all year around or just one semester of that specific class, can provide a crunch time. More often then not, the class does not finish up all the curriculum. If the teacher provides a project over the summer to ensure that the students learn what they need to before school starts, there is less crunch time and stress off both the teacher and students shoulders. By designing the project they can ensure that the children gain the knowledge that they need and are prepared to jump ahead on the first day back to school. A set topic and guidelines can allow for easier and quicker grading for the teacher. Just because a project is done the correct way, does not always mean that whoever completed it truly understands and can grasp that topic. Cheating is often done in times like this because nobody wants to do a boring teacher designed project during summer break.\n \n For better understanding, grades, more effort, and happier students, summer project should not only be student-designed but come with certain guidelines from the teacher. By creating their own work, it allows for the students to get interested and learn about the topic well. Although, it will not always be easy for them, it can provide better outcomes in the end. Their knowledge is what we should be concerned about, what promotes that more and that is what has to be thought about when arguing this topic.Â",

    essay: "The bane of many students existence are summer projects. Many students dread having to complete yet more schoolwork during the time in which they are supposed to be taking a break from school. Though we may not enjoy summer assignments, it can not be denied that they do help students retain information over the summer. Some people feel that these summer assignment should be guided by the students, while others feel the teacher should design the project. In my opinion, summer projects should be teacher designed because the teacher can ensure that students are learning what they think is important,Â it outlines what students need to do so that they do not have to stress about making their own project, and students can assist each other due to the projects being uniform.\n \n If the teacher designs the project, they can ensure that what the students are learning over the summer is going to benefit them when summer break ends. If students are allowed to make their own projects, the risk of them researching something unimportant or irrelevant is not unlikely. When a teacher designs the project, they can make sure that everything students are learning over the summer is important and relevant to their class. When I was in elementary school, we were assigned summer reading. This summer assignment was intended to help us improve at reading and to last most of the summer. No book list was given so we were free to choose any book we pleased. As a result, many kids chose to read short, easy books in order to complete the project as quick, and with as little effort, as possible. This puts them at a disadvantage as they did not get the same reading and word practice that other kids got. Teachers should design summer projects in order to make sure students learn what is necessary for the class.\n \n If students are given a summer assignment by theirÂ teacher, they are more likely to complete it over the summer, rather than last minute. As a student, knowing exactly what I have to do for the assignment makes it easier for me to complete them over time. This is because I know exactly what I need to do to finish the project, thus I can plan as to when I will complete each part of the project. To have the student design the project would add an extra layer of stress over coming up with and completing a project. This leads to them putting it off until they run out of time and have to rush their project to turn it in. When they wait until the last minute, they are likely to retain less information than if they did the project throughout the summer. During the transition from eighth to ninth grade, I was assigned a summer reading of a Greek mythology book. Along with the book, I was given a reading guide to fill out and turn in when school started. Having the reading guide allowed me to split up the reading and complete it over time. I could complete a page of the reading guide and then take a break, then pick it up another day and complete another page. Overall, teacher designed summer projects encourage students to complete their assignment over the summer through providing a structure that students can follow.\n \n Teacher created summer assignments promote collaboration as they are identical across students, allowing students to discuss with and help each other. This collaboration allows them to have better projects and learn more about the topic they are required to research. Students can share what they know in order to learn from each other. Some students are better at certain topics than others, if they can combine their knowledge with that of others they will improve their understanding of the topics. With no teacher to ask over the summer, their peers are the only one they have access to. Students can get help from their classmates and both improve their assignment, and their relationship. Being able to ask for help is greatly beneficial to students as ,otherwise, they would just leave it be and never be able to correct it. Going back to my Greek mythology summer reading, every student had to read the same book that I was. I was able to ask my classmates what they thought about certain parts of the book that I did not understand. This collaboration allowed me to better understand the book and succeed in that unit when I returned to school. Creating uniform summer projects promotes help and collaboration between students.\n \n In conclusion, summer assignments should be teacher created so that teachers can make sure students learn what is necessary, students actually do the assignment over the summer, and to allow students to work together on the assignment. I believe that it would not only benefits students, but also the teacher. The point of summer assignments is to help students retain or learn information. The teacher knows best what students need to learn over the summer to be successful when school begins. Teacher created summer assignments provide many benefits over student designed summer assignments and is the best way for students to learn over the summer",

    essay: "Summertime is by far the most favored season among students. Students of all ages get to relax and not have to worry about what time the bus comes or what day their six-page lab report is due. Three months of no worries is something that anyone could dream for, and students are fortunate to get it every year. Some could even argue that summer is too short, considering that we only get three months of break compared to the nine months we are in school. Nevertheless, summer is a gift for all the hard work students put in all year. As great as summer may appear to be, there is sometimes a downside that is tied to school: summer projects and assignments. Usually, the words \"summer\" and \"assignment\" are not supposed to go in the same sentence; but in some instances, schools give assignments to students over the summer so they are not unprepared for the arrival of the next school year. These assignments are meant to be helpful rather than work to keep you busy. Most students think these assignments are not right to give, and prefer to design the projects themselves if they must have them. For many obvious reasons, students should not design their own summer projects, for it is the teachers that truly know what will better them as students.\n \n Although student-designed summer projects may seem like an advantage to the student, it is very much the opposite. If a student designs something for themselves to be able to learn, they would not know what their supposed to do. With no real knowledge of the curriculum, how would a student be more well suited to create an assignment for themselves? Students need the teachers to set things up for them because they are the professionals that get paid to make these projects. The teacher will always know what is best for the student whether the student chooses to accept that or not. Summer projects are not always the most fun to do, but teachers construct them in order to benefit the student. Similar to the saying \"mother knows best,\" teachers know what is best for the student. Summer assignments should result in gratefulness toward teachers rather than resentment; because it is those same teachers who give the assignments that care the most about the student's future and wants them to be challenged. The bigger picture of these assignments should be thought about rather than seeing them as absolute burdens. Just trust and believe in the process.\n \n Next, if a student makes his/her own assignment, they would not push the limits of their own ability. In reality, if something could come easy rather than difficult for someone, the odds of taking the difficult path are slim to none. For example, a student is given the opportunity to write an essay on any topic they choose to. That may seem like an advantage to the student, but in reality is a disadvantage. The student will choose a subject that is very familiar to them because it is the safest to dive into. Doing what is easy defeats the whole purpose of what is supposed to strengthen a student. Teachers giving assignments is a more sensible concept because they know what will benefit the student. The whole purpose of assignments and projects being assigned rather than student-designed is to break students out of their comfort zone. Testing their abilities and seeing what they are capable of gives a better evaluation of the student. A student's willingness to work is crucial to their future as well as other aspects of life. Student-designed projects are not usually given because they do not display true capabilities. A task must be given to a student to determine their ability to go above and beyond.\n \n Lastly, teacher-designed summer assignments give the student a better understanding of what to expect for the upcoming school year. To illustrate, a new student could newly enroll in the school after moving from another state. The standards compared from their old school to the new school are likely to be different, leaving the student oblivious to what they will endure. The summer assignment is a preview for the year, showing what the student should expect to experience throughout the duration of the year. Summer projects also refresh students to how school goes so they are not going into the new year unprepared. Every student, for the most part, comes back to school rusty after summer break. Handwriting is crooked, having to adjust to the new schedule, even forgetting the log-inÂ and password to the computer. All of those things are expected because those things are taken out of the daily schedule that students endure. All of those things also make teacher-designed summer projects all the more effective as refreshment. Doing those projects get students back in the swing of things, as well as providing a head startÂ for the new year.\n \n To conclude, it is essential to students that their teachers design their summer projects. There are no real advantages to students designing their own summer assignments, whether students realize that or not. Teachers work everyday to better the education and future of their students; which means they know what is better for their students in the grand scheme of things. Although they may seem like a drag, summer assignments are meant to give a taste of what the new year will bring. A teacher would not give an assignment that provides no benefit to the student. Teachers are always a step ahead and know what is beneficial and not. Let them continue to do what they do best, which is help students go forward.Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

    essay: "At many schools, summer projects are assigned to students. TheseÂ projects are usually either an essay or a research project. Currently, these projects are strictly designed by teachers without any say from the students. Should teachers be dictating what students must spend their days doing during both the school year and the summer months? Would it be more beneficial for students' education if they were able to design their own project? Summer projects should be designed by students because there is more room for creativity, it is more sustainable for students to accomplish, and students will be more driven to work on it.\n \n Summer projects should be designed by students because there is more room for creativity. Creativity is an important skill to have, so a student-designed project will definitely help students in that area to use after they graduate. Imagination and creativity is much more of a key factor in student-designed projects than ones designed by teachers. When each student is allowed to come up with their own idea, plan it out, and create the project with little to no restriction or guidelines, there is more room for each student to show their individuality and original ideas. Without teachers telling students precisely what they want to see when summer break is over, students can let their imaginations run wild and create something that they are proud of.\n \n Students should be the ones designing summer projects because they would be more sustainable for everyone. Many students in high schoolÂ have summer jobs in order to help support their families. A teacher might assign a project that is far to lengthy for some students to complete in addition to their daily eight-hour shifts and having to take care of their younger siblings. These students' grades would sink the second the new school year starts due to their inability to finish the time consuming summer project by the first day of school. If every student were able to design their own project, they would be able to create one that is more sustainable and able to fit into their busy schedule.\n \n Projects assigned over the summer should be designed by students because they will be more driven to work on it. Some might say that isn't the case, because students might not take the project as seriously as they would if it was designed by a teacher. On the other hand, if students were able to design their own projects, they would be able to choose a topic to research and write about that interests them. Therefore, they will be more inclined to complete it and will take the project even more seriously than they would if it was designed by a teacher. Student-designed projects would cause students to be driven by their interest in the topic they picked; instead of by the need to get it done before school starts. This would not only lead to more competed projects, but the projects would also have a lot more time and effort put into them.\n \n In conclusion, it would be more beneficial for students' education to design their own projects. This would lead to more room for creativity, being more sustainable for students to accomplish, and students are more driven to work on it. This matters because what students do and learn now will affect the rest of their life. Students being able to do their own project or research over the summer could lead to students improving their work ethic and even finding their true interests. Schools should start making the changes today to create a new and important future in summer projects.",

    essay: "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during the break. There has been an recent argument stating if those projects should be designed by the students or teachers. Some state, projects should be teacher-designed because it will help students prepare for the upcoming school year, widen their knowledge of unknown subjects, and let's them apply critical thinking, but this is not true. Although some may disagree, I believe summer projects should be student-designed.\n \n There are a variety of reasons on why summer projects should be student-designed. One reason why they should be student-designed, is that the projects would be aimed toward their age. This is the case because, projects made by students would appeal more to the other students. It would also make the process of the project more fun because it is aimed towards the students' age. Another reason summer projects should be student-based, is that it would have more modern-based topics and issues. For example, the projects would have relevant issues of their society like, LGBT rights, school shootings, and police brutality. These projects would also have interesting topics students may enjoy. Those topics could be about: social media, celebrities, fashion, and sports. Student-based projects would also include diverse options. Student projects would let students have the option of doing group work. This would develop the students teamwork as wellÂ as their work ethic. Another option student-based projects would provide are projects related to students' hobbies and skills. Projects that require hands-on activities or art-like objectives, would strongly interest students into doing them.\n \n There are further reasons why summer projects should be student-based. Student-based projects would be easier to understand. Since the projects were made by students, the projects would help the students understand the information. Unlike a project made by teachers, student-based projects would help students learn at a way easier and faster level. When the projects are easier to understand, this would improve students' attention span. Another reason why summer projects should be student-based, is that students would obtain better grades. Students would improve at a subject at a far better level, because the projects would be topics that they enjoy. Since the project accommodates to them, the students would earn way better grades than something that doesn't interest them. When something interests a person, they tend to want to understand it at a far better level. The final reason, student-based projects are more beneficial, is that it would provide better learning. Students would be more invested in a student-based project, because it would be directed towards them. They would also be more involved, which would inevitably, make them learn better.\n \n I believe projects over the summer should be student-based. This is the case due to: it being aimed towards the students' age and it being more interesting. Those who disagree state: teacher-designed projects would help students get real practice, prepare the students, and help students widen their knowledge. I believe academic scores in school would be at an all time high due to students appliance to student-based projects than ever before.Â Â",

    essay: "If the Summer is plagued with more work we should be the ones to design it, so we can still be an creative and a hardworking student, have a strong understanding of the subject and voice out pressing matters in the world.\n \n While us students want to be done with school and be free, it is scientifically proven that if you don't continue learning a subject you'll forget about the subject you're learning. To keep that retention, the students should create a project to keep you the students in check; It can vary from a research project to an presentation using key objectives in class to show how you used them in the real world. The position everyone should say is, yes to further have higher Graduation rates and Test scores, because if the students show compassion to their school work & their will to get things done, every one will succeed. When we work together, build each other up and help each other when needed the world becomes a whole lot brighter, nobody should have to be bogged down in a project that seems like it was made to have you suffer. This project should be fun and should make you want to complete it to show your classmates how well you did; It should also prove that you care for your work and backs it up .\n \n On the flip side teachers did go to college for, four plus years and have been in this profession for even longer, so that is a great factor onto why most summer projects are teacher designed and so pressing on certain subjects. It's not supposed to be hard, the teachers just want he best for you, and have to teach you the schematics for next year or for life. It's similar to parenting, sometimes you have to be harsh to get the point through and the point is to get that student to be well rounded before he/she leaves high school. All the Teachers want to see is the students being successful and confident in everything they do to better on their lives. In short they want us to succeed to better on our lives; which is selfless and much appreciated.\n \n Another way to choose a student project would be an voting system, a select few would pitch in ideas that are teacher approved, that way we are still learning the curriculum but in a different/ active way; After that the whole class votes, yes or no. If yes it goes on to other classrooms until the verdict is reached on if the project is fundamentally helpful and play a healthy part on work ethic. This project will help students with the strengths and weaknesses, they can either group up to get it done quickly or go solo a on their own pace. Instead of laying on the couch, eating, sleeping, overall being lazy they can make that brain work as if they were still in school, I'm talking about firing all 8 cylinders and constantly learn more on a rigorous daily basis\n \n However, teachers are no joke though as they work day and night to give us students the best education possible, it's stressful being a teacher and in our eyes a worthy sacrifice.\n \n Grading papers form 150 students and also having to stay on track and give out more papers is a hassle; thats why we have teacher aide's to help them get through the day which is selfless and deserves recognition. To every teacher, thank you for doing what you do if we did not have you we would not be here learning.\n \n To add on to the previous statements, we can be more inclusive and have a battle of the brains where all teachers do a project & students do a project, whoever wins by vote from the school staff will get a a reward of their teams choice; these are all just ways to do school work but with a spin of fun & healthy competition, because seriously work can be boring for teachers and students alike ways we can fix this on a daily basis are:\n \n Have an reward system regarding questions and candy.\n \n Play an Kahoot game on the subject to engage participation.\n \n Let students design homework or class plans.\n \n Let them grade papers and see the process and life of a teacher.\n \n Have students stand up and stretch.\n \n Ice breaker activities.\n \n Talk about foreign matters.\n \n These are just a few ways to stick out from the typical, book work and paper.\n \n Book work has dated back decades, Its time to modernize and find different ways to learn.\n \n While for decades teachers have been prescribing projects that are an inch thick in paper, we have been struggling, we need change now; Change is good and needed change is how we industrialized and now change will be how we do our tests, papers, essays & projects. We should be able to choose what subject a paper is on and how should it be done, because in all honesty we are the future so we need to work on certain matters, problems & accessions towards our future like emissions, pollution & much much more. Student designed projects will talk about these matters and open up the public eyes about how serious we, the youth of tomorrow are taking it as serious as Gun control, College Debt and other pressing matters. Allowing us students to work and talk about problems all around us would be a pleasure to spread awareness on these subjects.\n \n To wrap this all up, We the students of tomorrow would love to be able to control summer projects in terms of spreading awareness/ looking at hard topics the public usually avoids. To be inclusive and attention grabbing is the goal and we can push for regulations throughout the school system, a recent matter was opening high school later than usual and getting in the nitty-gritty with financial costs & Bus scheduling. We can and will build each other up on these group projects. In turn we are equipping the mind for the real world we can use steps the we gained form high schoolÂ and teamwork to get the job done, test scores & graduation rates would be higher due to us engaging in school year round. To close, we can't get anything done without Teamwork and student input, we need to let students have a say in their education to let them be the best the they can be in anything and everything they do.

    essay: "Isn't it wonderful to know that you get a chance to design an independent project made by your own thoughts and ideas?! Back in my home country I use to attend a school where I was assigned a project by my teacher to complete over the summer. That didn't go well for me because I already knew how to do everything she assigned me, which didn't increase my level of knowledge at all. It makes it very boring to work on something that someone else is assigning you and you dont get a chance to learn. Summer projects should be student-designed because it makes them more enjoyable for students to work on, gives them a reason to sit back and observe, and teaches them to follow responsibility.\n \n First off, projects should be designed by students because it makes them more enjoyable for students to work on. My friend use to go in a school where she had a chance to design her own project over the summer and she said that it was great working on it. In fact, she focused more on the topics she was weak in during the school year. Projects are very fun to work on when you know exactly how you're going to design it. I personally love working on stuff where I dont have anyone giving me directions. However, I'm pretty sure none of us like being given a specific topic to work on and just getting stuck with it.\n \n Secondly why projects should be student-designed is so the students have a reason to sit back and observe. Although, everyone is always busy partying around and having fun until they remember that they also have a task to complete. They will set time besides gamboling and sit down to think how they want to design their project. Students will learn to generate new ideas and have the power to think fast. Since teachers always design things for students to work on if, for example, homework, classwork, labs, and etc..why not give the student a project to design by themselves.\n \n Lastly, summer projects should be student-designed because it teaches the student to follow a responsibility. If project is designed by the teacher, students will know in the back of their head what they specifically need to work on and they won't find that extra time for critical thinking. Most of the students will keep delaying their project because they know their already provided with what they need to work on. This makes it important to give the students a chance to get something completed in their own time with their own thoughts and ideas.\n \n In conclusion, I'm pretty sure a lot of students enjoy working more on what they design than what the teacher assign them. It makes them feel like a grown up knowing that now they have the ability to design a project by themselves. They know to find time and have the responsibility to think on their project because it's going to be graded and turned in after the break ends. It would be really satisfying to see how different students create projects which they design by themselves without any help! Â Â Â Â",

    essay: "Even during the summer, learning new material is important for students so that they can maintain their knowledge. Therefore, requiring students to complete summer projects is a great way to allow them to keep learning even outside of school. However, these projects would be best if they were teacher-designed, rather than if they were student designed. This is because teachers would be able to provide the projects with more reliable information and content than students who most likely would not be very experienced in the content. Also, students may not put much effort into their projects if they designed it, in order to make it less difficult for themselves, whereas teachers would make sure to design the projects in a way that would allow the students to put in the effort to learn the content. Lastly, teachers would be able to make the projects both educating and entertaining in order to fit the students' desires.\n \n Allowing teachers to design the summer projects for students would ensure that the students are provided with well-known and reliable content. For example, if the teacher were to design a math project with math problems or scenarios, it would most likely not have any mistakes and contain problems that the students would be able to solve. Whereas if the students were to design the projects that they didn't have much knowledge on, there would be a high chance that they may have made a mistake in the problems and as a result, affect their learning as well. Therefore, it would be less risky to allow these summer projects to be teacher-designed to make sure that the students are learning the right content that they need.\n \n Many students would argue that summer break should not include any schoolwork, therefore, assigning them to create a summer project would only influence them to create a project that is not educational,Â which would not benefit them in learning the content. For instance, if the student were completely against doing any schoolwork over their summer break but were still assigned with designing a science project, they would most likely design the project to be effortless, so that they could get it done as fast as they could, and not teach them any content. In order to ensure that the student does put in the effort to actually learn the information, it would be more beneficial to give them teacher-designed projects, which would provide them with the right level of effort that they would need to put into their work.\n \n In fact, a number of students do not even have much knowledge on how to create a well enough project that would best educate them. Therefore, teacher-designed projects would be able to suit the students' needs and provide them with information that would benefit them the most. In addition to this, teachers would be able to design the projects so that they could entertain the students as well as educate them. For example, the teacher could design a math game as a project, where the student could have fun playing the game as well as learn the math material. As a student just now learning the content, it would be best to have more experienced teachers create the projects in order to suit the students' level of knowledge on the specific content as well as their desire to be entertained.\n \n As a result, summer projects should most definitely be teacher-designed, as it would be more reliable, educating and entertaining. In the long run, the students would be more likely to learn the content without any mistakes and have fun learning it as well. Even if there are still many students who absolutely object the idea of teacher-designed projects, it would be best for them to keep in mind that these projects would do more to help than hurt them in their later years of school. In addition, these projects would give those students a head start in their learning and be more beneficial to help them maintain their knowledge for the rest of their school years.Â  Â Â Â",

If the things they choose to do is school-realatable than they should get to do it.\n \n A summer break is a kids time to have fun. It's not meant for more things school, it mean that school needs to be as far as possible. Kids should be out playing with their friends, not stuck doing something school realated. Kids should never be forced to do something that they don't want to do. Me, personally I would never take a kids summer break away from them.\n \n It shoud definently be student-designed.

    essay: "Giving students summer projects keeps their brains functioning. Some schools require that students complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. These summer projectsÂ should be teacher-designed because they know the content, have more resources and have more experience.\n \n All teachers know what content they will be teaching giving them an edge to designing summer projects for students. With an understanding of the content they will able to create projects that will be beneficial to the the students. Moreover, the teacher can plan summer projects that include information that the students will learn throughout the school giving the students a head start. For example, a math teacher might give his or her student a math related summer project which will cover topics that will be learn't in the upcoming school year. This makes the project something that will be helpful for the students and keeps their minds working. It will also make their school year easier since they've already learned some topics through the summer project.\n \n Teachers also have more resources to be able to produce summer projects for students to keep them engaged. Many teachers attend workshops and meetings to learn about ways to make their lessons better. This gives them immense amounts of resources they could use to put together helpful summer projects. They also have connections to other teachers and programs that students don't have the access to. These connections are important since they provide useful information. With that said, teachers would produce better summer projects than students would.\n \n Finally, teachers have more experience when it comes to designing projects. A big part of a teachers jobs is to create projects and worksheets for their students all year long. This gives them experience regrading what the students will enjoy and how to plan the projects. They would also know how to assure that the students are learning but in a fun way based off their experience. Teachers go through college to learn all this, so they have a lot of experience and a good understanding of what projects should entail.\n \n However, some might say students should be able to design the summer projects because they are the ones that have to do it. It is true that students are the ones that have to complete the projects but the teachers know what will be better for the students to help benefit them. For example, a student might create a project where they have to play video games. This would not benefit the students in anyway since they will not be learning anything. Therefore, summer projects should be designed by teachers because they know the content, have more resources and have more experience to assure that students continue learning during their break.Â",

    essay: "Schools do their best to provide best education for all the students. They have various types of summer projects, classes, programs, education tours, online courses and more, that a student can participate on. Some schools even have internships that students get paid from. Some schools assign students their projects to assure, that they continue learning during their break. Most students fail to continue to learn because they have their own personal plans to accomplish during their summer break. But, some students fail to do it because the projects were given from their previous teacher, that they have already had and they do not want to work for them again. They would be more happier to design their own project for the break. The fact that they want to choose their own project is because they want to be more productive and more innovative. Although, summer projects should be student-designed.\n \n Some people might claim that, projects should be school-based and it should be assigned by the teachers because they have the best opinions for the student to work on and they are more relevant. Teachers can evaluate students' weaknesses and give them projects based on what they need, for their own practice and revision session during the break. Teachers should assign project about the course, that they have already completed for more revision and for more details about it. For example, i already completed the earth science course on my freshmen year but, for more details and information about the topic that we discussed, our teacher gave us the project about the climate change and the impact on the environment, during the summer time, so that we can be productive and visualize in our break. Teacher-designed projects are more reliable because the teacher can choose a specific topic for the students' requirement. Some students are naive, they can't come up with a topic and they end up not doing it. Of course, many students will probably disagree on student-designed projects, and claim that teacher-designed topics are way better.Â However, every person has an interest on doing something or every person have a hobby. Moreover, students should be able to decide on what they desire to work on from their own interest or describe about their hobby, writing an essay.\n \n Students should be self-reliance of themselves because self-reliance is the key to success. They should not depend on anyone else, but their heart and the way how they think, that will bring accomplishments to their lives. I understand that teachers are responsible of giving the best topics for students to work on, but i believe that, students have followed all the directions of the teacher, during the entire school-year, but in a long break, it should be the opposite. Teachers should allow students to think of their own and come up with a topic ,and write what they have learned from the teachers. Student-designed projects will help them research about topics and, it will benefit them for the future. It will help them think independently. It will allow them to choose their desired topic and work on their own will. For example, my oceanography teacher allowed us to pick a topic from the board and he gave us an option to choose our own topic too. I managed to pick a topic that i desired, eventually, i completed my project researching and thinking about the topic on my own because i was able to elaborate it myself, since i got to choose the desired topic i want, but some of my classmates had a hard time by only researching because they chose the topic from the board. Furthermore, students can observe from their teacher and get to the point, when they can think for themselves.\n \n It is evidenced that, you can learn a lot from visualization. Most of the students go to trips, during summer time with their family ,and that will be great advantage for a student to come up with a self-designed project, as they visualize on their trip. For example, when you go to the museum, there is lot to visualize and learn from it. Self-designed projects would be complicated for some students, but most importantly, research and your effort, is required. As evidenced by the quote, \"as you sow, so you reap\", it means the harder you work, the better your results will be. We should always remember that, effort is valuable. Self-designed projects are very beneficial because it helps you to work as an independent individual. Furthermore, you will gain the way how you think, both physically and mentally.\n \n In conclusion, teachers should allow students, to think for themselves' ,and allow students to choose their topics. Students-designed projects will help them think more efficiently and it is more convenient for both students and the teacher. Visualization would be an easy hint for the student to work on theirÂ project. For the solution, teachers should assign students to write a journal about, how they spent their time during the long summer break. Potentially, this will make it very easier for both students and the teachers. This will allow student to write about their real-life event ,and it will make the teacher very happy about reading student's personal summer experience.Â",

If students are able to design their own summer projects they'll have more motivation, use their own creativityÂ and avoid procrastination.\n \n First, students tend to always procrastinate with a lotÂ of homework assignments,especially over big breaks. This can lead to not doing an overall good job on a project, which can then lower students grades. When I was in my freshman year of high school, I had a summer assignment due by the first week of school. I had to read any book that my teacher had put on a list. The list was of super boring poetry books that I had nothing in common with. I had to pick a book so i finally picked this random book, Fly. I didnt want to read this book so I waited until the last week of summer break to read it. Little did I know that I had to write an essay, create a poster about the book and create a short film about it. I was up every night that week trying to complete it last minute. When I got to the first week of school I had received a 78 on the project. This was not the best I could of done, but because I waited last minute I got a low grade. If I had a book that I was interested in this would all of been avoided.\n \n Next, creativity is something that people lack nowadays, they always rely on others to create something for them such as projects, work, etc. If students are challenged to use their own creative minds to create a project it will help them for the future when they need to do these things for jobs. I am someone who hates being told what to do and how to do something, so being able to design my own project will make me want to do it even more. I had a project that I got to design for my chorus class that I was in my sophomore year. I got to create a schedule for elementary school choirs, that was the topic I got to choose myself because it seemed interesting. I did my own research and found the perfect teaching plans for an elementary school choir class. It was such a good project because I was able to create exactly what I was passionate about, but it was still related to the class I was in. The elementary school across the street from my high school liked my ideas so much from my project that this year they use it for their lesson plans.\n \n Lastly, students already have very little motivation to do anything in the summer time. All they want to do is have fun and not have to worry about school projects. Teachers expect us to want to do everything that they assign and thats not always true. If they want to keep students motivated and to do something well done, then teachers should have students do their own work. Forcing us to do something also makes students not motivated. In my sophomore year, I had a few teachers force us to do assignments that were very boring and it made me not motivated to do it at all. If I was able to design my project I would of been happier and not have felt forced to do it. I would of enjoyed working on the project and I would of done my best on it.\n \n It is nice when teachers come up with ideas on assignments because then students will have deadlines to complete it by, its more organized and teachers dont have to worry about students going off topic, but having students pick what they want to do will make a better project overall because students will be more motivated to do it, turn it in on time, not procrastinate and use their own creativity inside of their summer projects.",

    essay: "Would you prefer it if your summer project was teacher-designed or student-designed? Schools that require students to complete a summer project to make sure they continue learning, should have the teachers design the projects, because getting the teachers to choose what their students projects should be about, helps expand the students knowledge, it gives the teacher security that the students will do the project as expected and it also get the students out their own comfort zones.\n \n First, schools that require students to complete a summer project, should have the teachers design the projects, because it will help expand the students knowledge. For example, if students know little to nothing on the topic given to them, they will discover facts they didn't even know existed. In addition, if the students discover interesting facts about the topic given them, it would encourage them to do some more research on the topic; therefore, expanding their knowledge even more than before.\n \n Next, schools that require students to complete a summer project, should have the teachers design the projects, because it will give the teacher security that the students will do the project as expected. For example, if the students were to chose the way they design their projects, it would never get done because they'd procrastinate. However, we can't say for sure that the students will do their summer projects if the topics or the way it is designed is given to them, but we can say for sure it give the teacher the reassurance they need.\n \n Finally, schools that require students to complete a summer project, should have the teachers design the projects, because it also will get the students out their own comfort zones. For example, if students were to chose the way their projects are made or what topic to make it about. It would be about something they have knowledge of, something thats within their comfort zone. Although, most students like to stay within their comfort zones, it's good to expand that comfort. You never know what you might find and catch of interest.\n \n In conclusion, schools that require students to complete a summer project to make sure they continue learning during break, should require the teachers to design the projects because it helps the students expand their knowledge, gives the teacher security that the students will get their projects done during break, and last but not least, it gets the students out of their own comfort zones.",

    essay: "During the summer, students want to play video games, hang out in the mall with their friends, relax at the pool, or just sit at home in their room and just be on their phones. The one thing students dislike is that schools expecting them to finish up a summer reading project or a math project. They do not like it at all. But, if the students play a part in planning some of those projects and it becomes student-designed, it may persuade the students to actually care about it and possibly build up a good study habit throughout the summer as well.\n \n Student-designed summer projects should take over teacher-designed summer projects due to the fact that student would be interested in perfecting their skills in areas such as reading and writing, which in some cases, those are some of the areas where students struggle at coming back to school. In addition, the students may not feel obligated to do it. They may feel like they have to do this because the school made them do it over the summer to stay focus. If the project was student-designed, the student would feel like the teacher or school is hearing them out. Therefore, the student will do it because they had a piece of input in the project and the teacher/school would not have to worry about most of them not caring about the summer project.\n \n The goal of a school is to ensure that the students are getting the education they need and to help get the students involved more in learning and by having a summer project that is student-designed it would put them one step closer to that goal. For example, if the students were able to help design the project for the summer, they technically still be helping to achieve the schools goal which is to get them ready over the summer.\n \n In conclusion, student-designed projects should replace teachr designed projects because in the student-designed projects would help the students get invovled more during the summer and they would care about it more because they were apart of the process rather than teacher-designed projects which you have to do what the teacher wants you to do.",

    essay: "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to make sure that students learn throughout summer break. Teachers should design these task so that the projects will actually help students retain and gain knowledge and there will also be exponentially more organization if a teacher were to create the projects. Some would say that students should design summer projects, but there is a great chance that the project the students make will not be focused on academics.\n \n To initiate, teachers should design summer projects because it will allow students to retain and gain information. Schools that allow the students to decide on what they should learn and review over break come to the conclusion of students returning with very minimal knowledge. That leads to the teachers having to spend weeks or even days reviewing! To illustrate, when I was in seventh grade, the teachers decided give the students the freedom to choose what the summer projects should be. It became extremely chaotic and did not help whatsoever. We were forced into a multitude of weeks of spiral review because of that foolish decision. Also, teachers go to college specifically to learn how to educate students in the best way possible. Therefore, they have a lot more experience in lesson planning and teaching in general, so it should absolutely be teachers that create summer project that would be the most beneficial to us.\n \n Furthermore, a teacher, that has far more expertise and credibility in educating, will have a greater sense of organization than a student would. Teachers easily spend hours of their days making plans and lessons for students, so they clearly already have the capability to make the summer projects a lot more thorough and precise with the learning material. Take a look at a teacher's desk. There will be a grand amount of binders, folders, notebooks, and so many other items they use to organize their work. All of their work is categorized to the smallest detail to help make the lessons they create be the most beneficial possible. Now take a look at an average student that has a singular binder with papers shoved everywhere. I can almost guarantee you they will then be searching, for what feels like an eternity, to find an assignment somewhere in the midst of the labyrinth of crumpled papers. This is exactly why a teacher should be the one who designs summer projects.\n \n However, there are people who fully believe that summer projects should be student-designed, but that could not be any farther from the truth. If a student were to create their own summer assignments, then there will most likely be no focus towards academics. The overwhelming majority of students would take the easy way and make their projects be as minimal as possible, so that they could go back to what they wanted to do. Once again, students would come back from break not knowing any more than what they did before. If a teacher designs it, they could have the project spread out through the break to make it not as cumbersome. Then the students would retain the information from the projects rather than them rushing to complete it all at once just to get it over with.\n \n In conclusion, teachers should design these tasks so that the projects help students keep the information that they gain, teachers are also a lot more organized because of the experience they have, and the educators would be capable of making the summer projects a lot more academic than the students.Â",

    essay: "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Usually, these projects are made by teachers, but students should be able to make their own projects. These projects should be student-designed because students will time their time and do it, be creative with the project, and they will be excited about it and learn something new.\n \n As students make their own summer projects, they will take their time and do it. They will choose the topic they want and start planning to make sure everything will look right. They wont feel the need to get it done so quickly. Students will want their projects to look like nice. I had these two friends who were in two different classrooms. The first teacher made the summer project and the second teacher let their students make their own project. The one friend who had the teacher that made the project, she felt like since it was already planned out, that she didnt feel that it was necessary to do it at that moment and she ended up doing it the day before it was due. The second friend who made her own project, she took her time and did it. She planned it out. She finished the project a month early. However, some students who do make their own projects end up doing it a week before its due, but that's better than having it do it a day before. Students will feel that making their own project is better.\n \n With students making their own projects, they'll be creative with it. They'll let their creativity side come out. Students won't feel bored. Since they're designing it, they will have fun with it. They won't feel the need to procrastinate. Students will want to make the project look perfect. My cousin, who had a teacher that let them make their own project, made her project look so colorful and beautiful. She took her time with it. She told me that she didn't rush and that she wanted it to look nice. She told me that before she was never really creative until she did her project. She felt that when doing this project, she was very creative. It surprised her. So, making a student design their summer projects, it shows them how creative they are.\n \n Students will be excited to make their own projects. They'll pick a topic their passionate about. They will learn more about their topic. They'll teach themselves. They will retain new knowledge. They won't be bored. In 7th grade, my teacher gave us a project to do over the summer. It wasn't fun. It was boring. I didn't learn anything new. It was the same thing, I learned in class. It made me not want to do it. So, I forgot about the project the whole summer and I ended up doing it on the first day of school. It was rushed, but I didn't care because it didn't interest me. If I were to do a project that I was going to make, It will make me feel excited about it. It will make me want to do it. I will have picked something I didn't know aboutÂ and from that I will have learned something new. I would want to finish it and see the outcome of it. By the student designing the project, they will be excited and learn something new.\n \n Overall, students designing their own projects is better than the teacher designing it because students will do it and take their time on it, will be creative, and be excited about it and learn something new. They won't feel bored and won't procrastinate. They won't do it a day before it's due. They'll plan and take their time. They'll feel proud about their work. So, schools should have students design their summer projects because they will continue to learn during their break.Â",

    essay: "Remember that moment on the last day of school, right before summer break? Remember the mid-day naps and late nights spent with friends? Remember the horrifying moment of realization that your summer project is due in less than a week; and you haven't even started? Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure the continuation of learning over their break. Summer projects should be student-designed because it allows the student to choose a project according to their own personal interest, it would be less confusing for the student and parent(s), and the student is more likely to prepare and produce a quality project.\n \n Many families have exciting activities planned for the summer time. They travel and explore new things with their children, helping the kids develop an interest in different things and the desire to discuss them. Allowing students to choose and design their own projects gives them the opportunity to express their interests. It also allows the teacher to evaluate their skills and learn about the student. My cousin is very fond of rocks andÂ the rock cycle. For his summer project, his teacher allowed him to design it himself and he created an elaborate project on the rock cycle. His teacher later contacted his mother and praised him on his creativity and knowledge of rocks. Through the use of student-designed projects, the teacher was able to discuss the areas that he needed improvement in and identify his interest.\n \n Doing work that teachers give you can be difficult, especially if they aren't around to help clarify their requirements. Student-designed projects would be more efficient because it would be less confusing on the students and the parents. Parents often attempt to assist their children with their projects, but it can be difficult understanding what is needed and sometimes the child ends up receiving a low score. Last year, I had a summer project prompt that I didn't understand. Naturally, I went to my mother for help. She gave great advice and answered my questions, but when I turned in the project I received a sixty-seven. The teacher said that I hadn't answered the prompt correctly. I was confused because my mother had helped me with the prompt. The teacher sat down and explained what it was she was looking for and gave me the opportunity to make up my grade. If my project had been student-designed, the teacher would've had minimal involvement in the project allowing me to put it together in a way I would have understood, eliminating confusion.\n \n No one likes being rushed to do things they don't feel like doing. Students are more likely to prepare and produce a quality project if it is something they want to do. Most students struggle with time management for the simple fact that the things they need to do aren't interesting. There's homework, chores and sometimes work. Summer projects shouldn't be another boring task assigned by a teacher, it should be up to the student. When you give the student control over their task they will want to complete it in a timely fashion and they will make sure it is their very best work because they want to take pride in its uniqueness. It's like dance competitions. The dancers are allowed to choreograph whatever they want as long as the dance fits the assigned dance style. They are then graded on technique, creativity, and skill. If schools made summer projects student-designed, students would be more motivated to do them because they can make them as interactive and different as they want.\n \n Having summer projects helps the teacher keep track of the progress of learning over the summer. Summer projects should be a simple way for students to express their interest and have fun.",

    essay: "The summer project should be Teacher-designed because the teacher knows more about the subject than students do. the main reason why a summer project would be assigned is for students to continue their learning career during break. Most school projects are usually not hard but time consuming. They really help students to not forget about what they are learning about. In the summer time, students tend to take their whole mind off school because there is no work to do, but if they have a project to do, its easier to keep your mind on the subject your learning.\n \n If the teacher was the creator of the project, it would be so much more straight forward and exactly on the topic that he or she was going for. The reason why it wouldn't be a good idea for a student to create the project is because it may not be what the teacher wants us to learn, for example, if we are going to read a summer book, and then write a summary on the book; the student can choose a book that: they already read, a very short book, or a book that has nothing to do with the topics they learned about. If the teacher assigned the book, She would let them read and study a book she thinks is best for what they learned over the year.\n \n Another point about why teachers should be the one who designs the projects is because, They have more knowledge about the topic. For example, my history teacher gave us a project to do on world war II, and we had the choice to either create the project ourselves, or for the teacher to design it for us. We had one week to decide either or not we should design it or not, so we made a chart. The outcome of this chart should us that it would be best if the teacher designed it for us. The reasons for letting our teacher design for us was: the teacher is gonna be grading it so we want to know how to do it right, if we were the ones to design the project, and everyone in the class has a different subject, then it would be very confusing on the teacher to grade or talk about in class when we come back in the summer.\n \n The only reason I feel like would be a better idea if the students designed the project is because it gives more creativity for the students. The problem about that is, the student can do the project the way the teacher does not want it to be made. I think the best way to handle this situation is if the teacher gave the students a specific topic and specific rules to the project. In that case the student can be creative but at the same time, the teacher would be able to grade it and talk about it in the class for everyone to listen, because everyone's project would be on the same subject.\n \n In conclusion, the teacher should design the project because, it would give the student a better understanding on the subject that the class is learning about. Students would have a broader thought about what they learned about in that class. They would not forget about what they learned, and they would keep it in mind through out the whole year. It is honestly hard to remember everything you learned during the year, so summer projects are great for students, if the teacher was the one who designed it.",

For example, some people are really lazy and just need a little push, so If any teacher consider doing a teacher-designed project It will give the kids the push they need to completing their project. Even though kids like to complain alot maybe this would stop them from complaining and actually finish there project, you also can get a good grade.\n \n Another reason to having a teacher-designed project will be more kids will be able to complete their projects faster.

If my teacher was helping me In some type of way I would complete my project faster,turn It In on the dead line, and get a good grade on It.\n \n Some people say that student-designed projects can get you thinking or you can be creative. However It will take you way longer to complete. For example, If I was doing a project I would have to think about what I wanted to do and get my supplies that I would need, but If it was a teacher-designed project all I would have to do Is get the supplies I needed to complete the project.\n \n In conclusion, summer projects should be designed by your teacher because it can be easier and more kids will complete their projects faster.

    essay: "In our world, many school are now requiring students to complete their summer projects so they could assure them to continue learning during their break. However, now they having a troubling tie deciding if school projects should be teacher-designed, or student-designed. The two controversy bias options have been growing in demand deciding which one would further help students with their academics. Summer projects should be student-designed because students will be able to choose a project that appeals to them and be able to continue learning about.\n \n School projects should be considered to be student designed because students will be able to choose their own project that should appeal to them. If students don't get to choose and project they want, how will they even be motivated to learn about it? Students should able to find a project that is considered enough for them to work on, so they could be motivated enough to study. This then, help the students to learn more about their project and also help them conduct their own experiment with them, and finally this can help them to present their work showing what they have done. For example; if say a person chooses to a mini volcano project, he would first have to find out how to make it, then he have to study about how it works, and finally how will he summarize it on what id does or how an eruptions occurs. This can give a great start on what they choose to do or plans to do.\n \n Next, school projects should be student-designed because students will be able to share and present their projects in class. This can help benefit both the students and teachers because the students are showing knowledge about their project, while teachers administer them to see what they have learned about. In the end, this will let teachers and school that student-designed projects are much more beneficial than teacher- designed projects. This can soon increase the chance's of choosing school-designed projects over the next couple decades. Leaning towards the future, many students will continue this and succeed in their academic or future jobs.\n \n Students projects should be teacher designed to many students because teachers can choose project's they choose for their class and teachers can decide how toughÂ they should be. However, if the teachers do decide to do this, theÂ students will then not be able to understand what to do, they will not be able to do the project, and they can be very relectutant enough to do the project. Instead, what the schools' can do is let the projects be student-designed so, students will be able to choose a project that appeals to them and be able to continue learning about. From this, many students wouldÂ work on their projects, be motivated and end up work as hard as they can to do well in their academics. This will soon give a bright future towards all the students and a time for all the teachers to relax.\n \n In conclusion, schools should decide school projects should be student-designed because students will be able to choose a project that appeals to them and for them to be able to continue learning about. Towards the end, this bring's up students grades, achieve their dream goals, and help them and their school for choosing the right choice of what they have to do for the students school projects. This will then do a better job of taking care of the students and helping them retain their knowledge over break in a better manner than teacher-designed projects. In the other hand students than can support each other in taking in these projects and move further on working as groups or working in a competitive way, seeing who will get the better made. In the end, towards everything this new decision should be able to help everyoneÂ world widely.",

    essay: "Some schools have summer projects so they can make sure their students still remember what they learned. I think these summer projects should be teacher-designed because if students designed them they would be super easy and the students wouldn't be remembering anything as well if the teacher made it. If teachers already design work for the students then it wouldn't be as difficult for them to make the summer projects. And teachers making them would mean a lesser chance of cheating\n \n If students were to design summer projects for themselves then they wouldn't be remembering as much if teachers design it because students would just make the work really easy so they wouldn't have to do much. Also if students made them then there would be a higher chance of the students cheating because a student could make something that is very similar to another students work and the teacher wouldn't even know. And the students could have just thought of the same idea and then they turn it in and the teacher thinks they cheated when it was just a coincidence so they get in trouble for thinking similarly.\n \n If teachers designed them then it would be less work on the students and the teacher and the teachers already make work for the students. the way it would be less work for the students is they wouldn't have to think about what they're going to make they would just have to think about how they are going to do it. And teachers would have less work because they would know a general idea of what they were grading instead of it being something the student made up. Also teachers already make work for the students so they are used to it. And if teachers made them there would be less chances of cheating because the teacher made the work so she would know if the students were copying from each other\n \n Those are some reasons why teachers should make the summer projects instead of the student. So it might be a bit more work for the teacher but it's overall better for everyone because the students get to remember the information they learned and the teachers get to do less work when they have to grade it.",

    essay: "Summer projects are seen as a way to make sure that students are learning. These summer projects are usually teacher-designed. It is a valid opinion to believe that the projects should be teacher-designed. There are many reasons for the projects to be designed by teachers. The students could easily pick simplistic projects that do not give them any type of learning experience. Teachers know more about the topic and could give them different ways of learning. Lastly, students can easily forget to do something when they are responsible for the outline or design for an assignment that is usually given and made by a teacher.\n \n Students over the summer usually want to save time for leisure activities. When the idea of school comes into the minds of these students, it can be seen as agitating. When you add the freedom to make your own project the way you want, there can be downsides for the student and the teacher. Since many students want to minimize stress during their break, they could easily make a project that makes the work appear as effortless. This effortless mindset usually produces work that is mediocre and possibly doesn't go into detail about what the project is about. This could anger teacher and make their assigned project appear to be pointless. The student's work would have no benefit to their grade or their opportunity to learn.\n \n As a teacher, it should be necessary to keep your students focused on the topic that is at hand. Some teachers will even go out of their way to do this by giving a project over the summer. Many teachers give these projects to students with additional options designed by them. This is logical, due to the fact that a teacher knows a lot more about the topic of the project than the student. The job of the teacher is to find a way to make the information adhere to the student's mind. The teacher's perspective will give the student different ways to learn the material while keeping them interested and busy over the summer. In my experience, I found that I was more motivated to do a summer project and learn more about the material when I had different ways of learning it through the teacher's direction. When doing a summer reading project, I had read the book but found little interest in finding a way to incorporate my own creativity into the project. It was much easier to just read the directions given from the teacher and it also made me learn the theme and main topic of the book more adequately.\n \n Responsibility is a necessary thing for students to have. But it is very common to find students overwhelmed with this new foundÂ freedom. Many people forget to do things when it is necessary for them to do it without guidelines or specific criteria they have to meet. Sometimes it's not that they forget, but that they are totally frustrated with the idea that they have no assistance on the project. This could be especially troubling over the summer as students are more focused on enjoying their break. The idea that they have to do something on their own without any prior information can be overlooked. When doing a project for a pre-IB class I found that it was easier to do when I had guild linesÂ to measure up to and it wasn't just a time for me to implore on my creative talents in order to get something done.\n \n Summer projects are something to make sure students keep learning over their break. It's clear to see that teacher-designed projects are much more efficient. Without the guidance of teachers, students could make simplistic projects that offer no benefit for the teacher or student. The teacher's knowledge about the project could make it helpful for their students to keep learning different ways about the material. It is also common for students to forget or lose interest when they are given too much responsibility for an assignment. Student-designed projects can leave room for a large quantity of errors and mistakes that could ultimately defeat the purpose of a project. Therefore, teacher- designed projects are better in the sense that they can keep the student learning as if they are still in school but give them time to enjoy the benefits that come with summer break.Â Â  Â  Â",

    essay: "The word \"Summer\" brings a lot of feelings of excitement. Kids across America know summer to be a time of freedom, and a break from school. Recently, some schools are requiring students to participate in summer projects. These projects are used to continue student educate year round, opposed to the regular school year. Some schools feel the need to determine the project for the students, instead of allow exploration into interests. Other school allow for schools allow for student-designed projects, in whichÂ students are able to form their own project, and delve into what intrigues them. I believe student-designed projects are more beneficial to education because, they would be relevant to student interest, and allow for creative exploration;teachers must check student-designed projects for educational content.\n \n School can feel like a rut,however, summer can turn that rut into a mountain of good feeling. Some topics covered in the classrooms have no benefit beyond the test, and a teacher-designed project would be no different. Most kids don't appreciate being forced into any sort of work, especially during their months off, so providing a predetermined project would not peak a students interest. If something isn't interesting to the student, are they truly learning? allow students to formulate their own project, and plan it out would create a better passion for education, and their summer work. When students find their work relevant, they work harder, and in return learn more. Since learning more is the whole goal, I see a clear argument for student exploration during the summer months. When students are left are able to pursue their interest, you will find an increase in creativity.\n \n Everyone likes to picture themselves as a free thinking, and it can be hard to channel that in a traditional high schoolÂ environment. Allowing students to investigate their passions will result in increased creativity, along with better work. As they begin exploration into their projects, they will feel better about the whole working over summer idea. With their own interests at the heart of their projects, students will be able to come up wtih more creative,and innovative project ideas. As the find themselves deeper in their left hemisphere, they will be faced with increased problem that will be unique to their situation. Since all students will be completing personal unique projects, they won't be able to rely on others for direct solutions to their problems, which will increase problem solving skills. With increased student freedom, comes the downside of noneducational content.\n \n Students may get a little off topic with their first attempt at a student-designed project. While I believe student freedom is important, I also feel their should be strict guidelines to maintain educational value. Since summer is a time for students freedom, all students are going to search for the easy way to avoid work during their break. It's the heart of our nature. This can easily be avoided by guidelines, and teacher approval on their proposed project. Teachers must find their investigation education, and discover the value in their topics, while allowing for an open mind, not to control students. Teacher approval will allow for the educational value to be present, while allowing students to explore their interests. This balance between education, and freedom will maximize summer project learning potential.\n \n Education is a fine line between interests, and true value. summer projects are meant to increase value, but teacher-designed projects can weaken interest. No students likes following the same instruction through the school year, and keeping that procedure during summer projects would be painful for students. They would not find teacher-designed projects relevant, which would lower interest in their project. Without interest, students would lose educational value through teacher projects. Student-designed projects are the happy medium for summer work. Student-designed projects would better educate because, they would be relevant to student interest, and allow for creative exploration,however, teachers must approve students' projects in order to maintain education value.Â",

    essay: "Summertime is a time for students to take a break from school. Taking a break, however, comes at a cost. During summer, students tend to forget things they learned in the past school year. This is why some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure students continue learning, even during summer. These projects should be student based because it can be used as incentive to work,Â gives students more options, and makes sure everyone can do them. When it comes to summertime learning, students should be in control. When students design their own projects, everybody wins.\n \n During summer, it's hard to do school work when there's no school. Some students may find it hard to find ways to work while others may not even try. Giving students the ability to choose what to do can combat this problem by giving them incentive to work. When giving students the ability to choose, they are more likely to work on the projects. In addition, not only will they want to do the projects, but enjoy them, since the assignments are on the student's terms. Giving students more freedom when it comes to learning can strengthen their minds and help them grow.\n \n When the projects are teacher-designed, that means every student gets the same prompt. While this might be fine for some students, there's no way of satisfying every student. Letting students design their projects can make sure every student does what they want. If students were to design their own projects, then every student can be satisfied with what they do. Student-designed projects can also create diversity, ensuring every student's project is different in their own way. More choice when it comes to projects makes students more prone towards things they want to learn and might be able to learn new skills.\n \n Another problem students may face is the inability to do the projects. While some students may be able to accomplish the objectives of the projects, others might be incapable. Letting students design their own projects makes everyone capable of completing them. When designing their own projects, students will work with the resources around them and make sure that the project is able to be accomplished. At some point if the student runs into a problem, instead of going through the hassle of contacting a teacher and figuring out what can be changed, they can change the projects to their own standards, saving time and energy. Some people, however, may not agree with these reasons.\n \n People can still argue that teacher-designed projects are more successful. While it is true that if teachers designed the projects, every student will at least have something to work on, teacher-designed projects aren't the better option. Even though every student has a project idea, not every student has the means of accomplishing them. Even if they were, there's no tell whether they will like doing it or not. Students that don't like the project are more reluctant to finish or even start. While teacher-designed projects have one advantage, they also have many disadvantages.\n \n In conclusion, students should be in charge of designing their own projects during the summer. First, student-designed projects can give more incentive to students and encourage them to complete their projects. Second, student-designed projects give more options and freedom to students. Finally, giving students the ability to choose their own projects makes sure that each student can complete their projects. When it comes to summertime learning, students should be in control.",

    essay: "Why should summer be about learning if that is the purpose of school? Students go to school for most of the year and than they get a break, but are forced to do a project on a matter they may or may not like. Summer projects should be student-designed because students will have a lack of motivation if it's on a subject they don't like, they can pick their own project ideas with in reason of the school,andÂ students can be learn to think independentlyÂ from there teachers and make their own decisions\n \n Students will lack the motivation to do a project if it's not on a subjects like because they believe that the subject as no value orÂ purpose for them. For example,a student gets a list of project ideas they must choose from,but they don't like any of the ideas on the list; they still have pick a subject even though they don't find any value. The student will ignore the project because they think the idea is as no value or purpose to what they want to do in life. The subject on which the project is on was on value or purpose to the student because it was nothing to do on what they value or purpose in their education. Another example is,a student does a project on what a teacher thinks is a valuable lesson that they should learn about, but the student thinks the opposite but is told to find reasons on why the lesson is valuable. If a student was to pick their own subject on the project they would have more motivation because it has more value and purpose than on something that their teacher thinks is valuable and purposeful to them. Students would find better motivation to do the project now that they can do it now what they if valuable and purposeful. This shows that students will lack motivation to do a project if it was teacher-designed because the subjects that teacher pick have no value or purpose to a students education,and that students-designed will give a student more motivation to do something that they find valuable and purposeful than on a subject that can't express themselves on.\n \n Students can pick their own project ideas instead of the teachers ideas because students may have some better ideas than the teachers do. For example, a student wants to do a project on the important'sÂ of sleep in teens, but that isn't in the teachers list of ideas; it limits the students imaginationÂ and creativity; the teacher could have lost out on the opportunity to read or hear about a good subject. This limits the students imagination and creativity by limiting them to project ideas that have been over and over again and their creativity with old subjects and putting it into more modern or in a differentÂ way of approaching that same idea. If the students were to stick with the same project ideas and never use their imagination and creativity and would never learn different ways to approach on a topic that many people have seen, but never in a different way. This shows that students picking their own project ideas is a way to use their imagination and creativity and approach new or same ideas just differently is better than a teacher-design because teacher can get better topics from their students and use them for new students to come and not use the same ideas over and over again. The student and the teacher are two different groups,so what the teacher thinks is a good project idea is not the same for a student because they think differently.\n \n If summer projects were teacher-designed than it doesn't allow the student to think of these ideas them themselves. The students are relying on the teachers to pick the ideas, so they will never have to think for themselves, but if the the projects were student-designed that would allow the students to think for themselves and make their own decisions. For example, teachers allow the students to chose ideas and teach them to be independent from them and suffer the conquensensÂ if they don't chose a subject. The students learn the independence from teachers because they won't always have a teacher to depend on when they are out of school. This shows that being independent from the teacher is important because it teaches students to rely on themselves later in life.\n \n Summer projects should be student-designed because students will have a lack of motivation if it's on a subject they don't like, they can pick their own project ideas with in reason of the school,andÂ students can be learn to think independentlyÂ from there teachers and make their own decisions. Students learn to use and expand their imagination and creativity if they can think for themselves and it also teaches them to be independent from teachers because the won't always have them in the future.",

    essay: "Are you tired of rushing to get summer assignments done the week before school starts? Do you feel like summer assignments are just causing you more stress? How much information do you really remember from summer assignments when you go back to school? As students we all dread the strenuous summer assignments given at the end of the school year that help us prepare for our classes in the upcoming fall semester. These assignments often feel like a restriction from our fun summers that we have had planned for months. Students often put these assignments off until the very last minute, when school is getting ready to start again. There must be a way to make summer assignments for enjoyable for the students while still preparing them for their new courses. Summer assignments should be student designed because students can learn in a style that is best for them, they can space out the work load, and they can make it fun and enjoyable.\n \n Summer assignments should be student designed because it allows the students to learn in a style that works best for them. Many teachers assign long packets and textbook readings, which provide all the information needed, but it might not be the most efficient way to get the information to stay in the students long-term memory. Students learn in all different ways, some students learn better by reading information, others learn better by writing down the information, as wellÂ as some students learn better by hearing or working hands on with the information. Students are more likely to remember the information when it is provided to them in a way that is interesting and intriguing to them. Letting summer assignments be student designed allows the students become more creative outside of the classroom for example there are students that learn best by reading textbooks but other may excel in learning by creating a poster, an info graphic, or even a hands on model.\n \n Another reason why summer assignments should be student designed is because they can space out the work load. At the the start of summer most students are not thinking about doing their summer assignments. They just got out of school and they certainly do not want to focus on doing more work. If the summer assignments were student designed the student would know exactly how much work they have to get done for each class and they could approximate how long it would take them to complete it. This would encourage students to be more responsible for getting their work done and become more organized. The students would be able to plan out when they would need to the work and how the could evenly space it out so that they are still learning, but also enjoying their time off from school. Although there would still be students who would not do their work, or they would wait until the last minute to do their work, it teaches students to be more responsible and they would learn how to manage their time more efficiently.\n \n The last reason why summer assignments should be student designed is because the students can make it more fun. We all know that school work is not the most enjoyable thing, but it is especially not enjoyable when you have to do it during the summer. There are some more enjoyable ways of learning than just reading from a text book and pulling out the important information. If the students were able to design their summer assignments, they could look forward to doing them, because they are exciting and it would be something that the students want to do, not forced to do. It is psychologicallyÂ proven that people enjoy things more when it is not forced upon them to complete a task, so shouldn't that be the same for summer assignments? If students were able to design their summer assignments they would pay more attention when completing it and the information would have a greater chance of being encoded in their long-term memory, for when the school year starts again.\n \n Student would be better off if summer assignments were student designed because they can choose how they want to learn, they can manage their time and work load, and they can enjoy it while doing it. I think both teachers and students can agree that summer assignments are dreadful to complete and grade, so why not make it more enjoyable on both sides. Would you rather have students complete a summer assignment in a fun, creative way, or make it feel like a task, where they are least likely to retain any of the information given to them? School is stressful enough as it is, so why have that stress carry into the summer.",

    essay: "Summer is usually where I have most of my fun. I am always working, playing football, and hanging out with friends. Usually I dedicate most of my free time to things I love doing on my break, but sometimes when I have to do school related things, I like when I get to pick the summer project rather than the teacher to pick it. I think if the students get to pick the summer projects they want to do, it will probably lead to a better and more exciting project rather then a boring project which was required to do.\n \n I think if most students get to pick the summer project they want to do, they will find their topic more interesting, therefore making the project more enjoyable. If the summer projects become more enjoyable, students would actually want to them and not forget or ignore the projects until school starts back again. Especially since students are on summer vacation, most students will not do anything school-related or even the projects, but if they do it on something they enjoy, they would likely do it instead of slacking off. Students who tend to hate school may do projects if the projects are based on something they like or something they find interesting. Most students would actually have a passion and might even enjoy the projects they get to pick to do in the summers.\n \n I also believe the students will have more fun doing summer projects they enjoy rather than what the teacher picks for the students . Since students have more freedom and more say on what topics their summer projects will be on, I think the students would put more effort and more excitement into the summer projects. Projects that tend to be interested by the students can lead to a better projects since the students actually know the topics they like and choose those topics to do summer projects on them. Making summer projects more enjoyable could lead to students maybe liking school due to the freedom they get to pick went they choose their own summer projects instead of the teacher assigning the topics. And since the students get to pick their own topics, they will have more passion doing the projects, therefore leading to better projects and grades for the students and easier grading and less work for teachers.\n \n Lastly I believe that if students go to pick their own summer topics for their projects, they will finish it quicker and get it over with as soon as possible instead of waiting last minute to complete the projects. Since the students get to pick their projects, they would be able to finish it in no time due to their topic being interesting and their topics being enjoyable. Since students would most likely pick a topic they enjoy, their knowledge of the topic might be big or they might do a lot of research due to they wanting to find new information out, thus helping them finish this project easier and faster than other projects. Some people think that if teachers gave out topics for summer projects it would be more educational and better, but these people are wrong because if the students got to pick out there summer project topics, they would be able to enjoy it a little more and it would be more enjoyable to the students. Also if the students got to pick their topics for their summer projects, they would probably get it done with quickly so they could be able to do a lot more activities like hanging out with people or play sports or even work and since the topic they picked was something they had interested in, they would be glad to get it over with.\n \n In conclusion, all these reasons that were stated in this essay are good reasons on why schools should let the students pick their topics for summer projects instead of the teaching picking them out for them. Letting the students pick what topics they want to do for summer is an easier way to make the projects more exciting and better learning for the students. People should care about letting the students pick their topics because if they want to research more about a certain topic, this will allow them to able to research it more in depth and help the knowledge of the student grow more.Â",

    essay: "Summer projects should be student designed, because it's Summer break, most student's won't be doing work. They are most likely to be outside in the pool, at the park and playing sports. But because of that student's should be required to work on the project at leastÂ once a week every week until the due date of the project.\n \n Working on a student designed project could be more beneficial and encourage creativity and inspire many great idea's. because during Summer break because during break student's have more time and more creativity and inspiration, especially when it's student designed, every project would be unique and different according to the type of summer the student had, If they had a happy fun, filled summer the project could be fun and playful but if the student had a layed back and chill summer the project could reflect that and being chilled and layed back.\n \n It could also prevent cheating, and expose cheater's. As if two student's come back to school with the same project it's most likely they cheated. because whats most likely going to happen is the students who dont do any work will cheat and copy off of the students who took valuable time out of their summer.

    essay: "Dear Mr. Generic_Name\n \n Have you ever got a project and struggled with it so much because it was a certain part you didnt understand about the project? And you just thought to yourself \"if i could of picked what i had to do for my project i wouldnt struggle with none of the project i would get a good grade!\". If students could pick their own projects it would be creativity! Some schools are requiring students to complete a summer project over break, that way they can still learn while on break. However, they cant decide whetherÂ they want the summer project to be teacher design or student design. The summer project would be a better understanding for the students if it were to be student design. This way would be giving the teachers an understanding of how their students think on their own, And this is giving the teachers a way to help the students pass their class by letting them do something they enjoy and desire to do, Also letting the students decide what they would want to do for their summer project would encourage a lot of students to actually do the project!\n \n Its important for teachers to know what their students enjoy during far as learning actives for school. If students had a chance to design their own project it would show teachers their learning desires When i say that Im talking about what type of strategiesÂ students use to study for their tests, what actives do they prefer to do for a classwork grade, etc. This way teachers can figure out what would make more of their students pay attention during the lesson. Some students struggle so much because they dont understand certain things in school because of the way it is being taught to them. If students were allow to design their summer project it would give teachers a way to help their students be successfulÂ and pass their class. TeachersÂ would have a much more understanding onceÂ they see howÂ they prefer to do the work that they are being graded for.\n \n Teachers need to see the best way they can get their students to enjoy their class. It is important for the students to be engage in the class. For an example you are not going to pay attention to something that does not interest you. If the teacher knew what type of stuff interest the students they would know what type of stuff they would need bring to bring up when they are trying to teach the students. A lot of students fall asleep in class often because they are not engaged in the lesson. Letting the students design their own summer project could not only be a good thing the students but also a good thing the teachers. So many kids would learn so much just by paying attention because the teacher now has a better understanding on how to go about the lesson. Now a days students are receiving homework and not returning the homework in for their grade, and i know exactly why its tactics. Kids dont like paper pencil work, they much rather use the computer. For insist say i were a teacher and i were to say,\n \n \"OK class go home and in your notebook copy twenty of the vocabulary words down with the definitions. Fifty percent of the students would not complete that assignment. However if i were to say\n \n \"Class i want you to download this flash cards app on your phone or computer and design your own flash cards and show me once your done so i can give you the grade for that assignment\". Ninety percent of the students would complete that flash card app assignment. Because kids are interest in stuff you make fun for them to do and things that they are exciting for them!\n \n If teachers are granted to design the summer project most likely most students arent going to complete the project. Its not that students dont enjoy learning or completing their work, its simply that students struggle doing things they have no interest in. Its the teacher job to teach the students and make it interesting for them. If students were granted to design their summer project, It would encourage a lot of students to actually complete their project over the summer. When your teacher gives you an opportunity to express yourself and allow to receive a grade for it. That means a lot to most students. To some students teachers dont care enough to actually encourage students to engage with lessons. Being that students would haveÂ a chance to express their selves by completing a project would encourage the student to enjoy the lessons, the classwork, the homework, projects, andÂ so on in that class.\n \n If the summer project were to be student designed it would give teachers a better understanding on their students, Also it would teach teachers some ways to help students be engaged during the lessons,And it would definitely encourage more students to complete their projects in the future. Thank you for taking the time out your day to read my letter, I know my daughter will understand your decisions .\n \n Sincerely ,\n \n Generic_NameÂ  Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â",

    essay: "Some schools require students to complete summer projects assure they keep learning during break. I believe that these projects should be teacher designed. It has many more benefits to be teacher designed than student designed. It would also be easier on the students than making them design their own project.\n \n Firstly, it would be easier for the students to have a set criteria for the projects made by the teacher. If the students were to design the projects there would be more freedom, but also more room for error. the teacher designed projects would be easier to follow and help with getting the information they need to continue learning over summer break.\n \n Furthermore, the assurance of the students continuation of learningÂ over the summer is greatly increased. The teachers would be able to give the right information needed to do the projects. If the students were to design these projects it could not run as smoothly as it needs to; they could also get the wrong information.\n \n However, if the projects were to be student design, there could be benefits to it. There would be lots of room for creativity and originality. The students might have a better sense of freedom on the projects and it could possibly make them work better. Also, being able to design it themselves could instill a greater passion for working on the project. The possibility of being original with the project design could also lead to a better assurance that the students will still learn over the summer.\n \n In conclusion, the projects should be designed by the teachers. It gives better assurance to keep students learning. It also assures that they are getting the right information needed. It is also mainly easier on the students ability to do the project. The teacher designed projects provide the best assurance that the students have a continuation of learning over summer break.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â",

    essay: "Students are often given projects they don't like, but if they design them they could be a lot more drawn to work on them. Because is break, students shouldn't be working on a project they don't enjoy, they could choose to do a project about something they like. Summer projects should be student-designed, this would make the projects feel more personal.\n \n If students could design their own projects they would be more motivated to work on them. I once was assigned a summer project about whales, a topic I'm not really interested in. I didn't really worked on the project during break and waited until the last week of break to work on it and didn't really do my best on it. If students choose to do their projects about a topic they are passionate about, they will be more motivated to learn more about the topic and work on the project.\n \n Students should design a project they would feel confident doing. Everyone is different and every student is interested in a different topic. My sister was assigned a project about cooking, that is something she enjoys a lot, she finished the project the same day it was assigned. She already knew a lot about the topic but she learned more while doing the project and she felt confident doing it. Students could feel better doing a project about a topic they already know a little and want to learn more about.\n \n The projects they would design would let them have fun and learn while doing the project. I usually have more fun doing projects about topics I like to learn about. I learn a lot more when I'm interested in what my project is about. Usually people learn more when they are having fun because that makes them more interested in the topic. Because is summer break students should be given the chance to have fun instead of having to work on projects about topics they don't really care about.\n \n Having students learn during their break is important, but break is meant to have fun and relax. A project students can have fun doing is what every student would choose. If we let students do more projects about subjects they are passionate about they will be a lot more interested in doing them and will learn a lot more.",

    essay: "Summer is a time of hanging out with friends at the beach and relaxing in the warm weather, but there is always something that swoops in to mess it up: a summer project. Summer projects are not all bad, for they are designed to ensure that students continue to learn during their three month getaway from school. However, who should design the summer project the student or the teacher? Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers have more experience with projects than students, and students will lean toward designing a quick and easy project.\n \n Teachers have had more encounters with school assigned projects in their lifetime than their students. Most teachers have college degrees. They have done the twelve plus years of primary school to graduate, and then gone on to college and done two to four more years to get their degree. Through all that schooling many projects have been assigned and completed. All of this gives teachers the proper experience and background to come up with a well designed summer project for their students. Just this past summer my computer system networking teacher, Mr. Generic_Name, assigned us a project. It was a review project incorporating all of the course material from my sophomore year that he did not want us to forget during the summer. I remember how well rounded of a project it was, so much so that I had to ask him how he come up with it. Mr. Generic_Name told me that the project was inspired by all the projects he encountered during his four years at William and Mary. Due to Mr. Generic_Name having plenty of experience with higher education projects, it allowed him to design a well developed summer project for my peers and I. I can only imagine the toddler like projects that would have been produced if my peers and I were allowed to design our summer projects instead of Mr. Generic_Name.\n \n More than likely if a student is given the opportunity to do less work they are going to take that opportunity. Throughout my years of high schoolÂ I have seen this exact manner take place over and over. Students will take the easy way out by selecting courses that have a history of demanding very little from those enrolled. This same mannerism repeats itself once the student is enrolled in a course and it comes time to actually work. Just this past marking period my Math Analysis teacher, Mrs. Generic_Name, gave us a take home test for winter break. This test consisted of 47 problems. The more problems you did the higher grade you got, but students did not seem to take advantage of this. More than half of my class chose to only do 30 of the 47 problems. This was because completing 30 of the 47 problems earned the minimum for a passing grade, a 70 percent. My peers had full control of their grades and chose to only work for the minimum passing score so that the rest of their winter break would be free of math. This is what will occur if a student is allowed to design their own summer project. Once a student realizes that they get to design their project they will make it something simple, lousy, and childlike. The student will design something just good enough too pass, so that they can return to their more practical summer.\n \n Some argue that a student would be more inclined to do their project if they got to design it. However, this is not true as someone's interest in something does not determine whether they will do it or not, but their work ethic is the true determining factor. Summer projects serve a meaningfulÂ purpose; to make sure kids maintain learning and strengthening their brains even when school is out. Something with a strong purpose like that should not be taken lightly and should be handled by someone who can produce the best project. This is why summer projects should be teacher-designed, so that students can take away as much information as possible when the project is all said and done.",

    essay: "People go to school not only because they have to, but because a school's job is to advance students knowledge to set up kids and teens for their future goals. A teacher's job in the workplace is to give students knowledge on things they must know and help them with their next step in life. Their next step could be; college, applying for a job, help writing a resume, applying for a college, looking for a major, etc. After a long 9 months of school, some schools require students to complete a summer project to assure learning over the break. If students are required to complete a summer project, it must be student-designed because it introduces themselves, helps students discover their interest, and develops creativity.\n \n Summer projects should be student-designed to introduce themselves to their teachers the following school year. Martin Luther King Jr. created a \" I had a dream...\"\n \n speech that explained his struggle with racism and segregation. M.L.K. Jr. wrote and executed the speech in front of a live audience on his own, later making him the leader of the civil rights movement. The speech gave him a name worldwide, everyone knew \"Martin Luther King Jr.\"\n \n During the holocaust time period, a young Jew, Ann Frank kept a diary for people of the future so they knew what happened to all the Jews who were killed by the Germans. Her diary is now a famous book and in the Holocaust Museum in D.C. Ann Frank's diary was written herself, before that she was just one of many Jews, but because of her words, everyone know's who she is. A student-designed project would set up a teacher idea for how much their students knowÂ and help them to learn about their students.\n \n Students developing a project on their own develops creativity. Albert Einstein is known as one of the smartest people in the world. He created a robot, Frankenstein. Einstein blocked out others, used his own knowledge, got creative, and made history on his own. Helen Keller was born with the default of not being able to hear or to see. This was a tragedy, making it hard for Keller to walk and successfully know where she was going. Growing up with this issue she became extremely smart and used her problem, got creative, and began helping others by tutoring people who are deaf and blind. If students created their own projects it would give them an opportunity to come up with something incredible using what they, causing them to be creative, and generate ideas\n \n Students are in school receiving teacher-designed projects all year. On a students summer break, they should at least be able to create a project that interest them. Many young kids, between 3-7, try many different sports like; soccer, basketball, dance, gymnastics, baseball, cheer leading, flag football, etc. parents enroll their kids in different things so they can discover their interest young and stick to what does interest them to improve.Â Many high schools have electives to chose from as an extra class for students to find their interest. If teachers picked the elective classes for the students there is a good chance the student would not enjoy the class, destroying the point of an elective. By letting students branch out and selecting things that they enjoy could create an amazing project.\n \n Students wait all year for their three month summer break. Most schools dont require a summer project, however, some schools do. Over break there should be no project but if required give students the opportunity to design their own. This could not only benefit the students, but the teachers as well. A student-designed project would introduce students to their teachers, giving the teachers an idea of what the student does and does not know. It would cause students to brainstorm and come up with creative projects and help student's to find what interest them. A student-designed summer project would be effective for students as well as teachers.Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â",

    essay: "Some schools instead of letting students have a break during the summer, instead make the students complete summer projects. Why schools do this is for the students to continue thinking and learning during the break. Most schools have the teachers design these projects, but the real way they should do it is by having students design them. The reason it should be this way is because it will encourage students to think for themselves, will let students learn and practice a topic they are interested in, and for the fact that a student can learn in a way helpful to them.\n \n Independent thinking is a virtue that every single person should have. But sadly independent thinking is not something students get to practice very often. But summer projects that students get to design themselves is a perfect way for students to build and improve this skill greatly. Rather than the student half heartily completing a project that a teacher designed, the student would instead think up and complete a project themselves and will learn a great deal in the process. For example when I was in Tenth grade my history teacher had my class complete a project based on World War One, and those where the only instructions. If it had been a simple project where we each had to make a poster board for an event during the war. Instead each person in my class designed a project entirely their own. One person did a poster on trench warfare, another person came up with a song about how the war was started. I came up with a game that showed how hard it was to prevent the war. This project encouraged each person in that class to think for themselves and we were all better for it.\n \n Having to complete a project about a boring topic can be brutal. One reason is that when people are not interested in something they can have a hard time doing it. A student designed summer project could be a perfect solution for this. The reason being is that instead of a student struggle to complete a project they don't care about, the student can and learn and practice a topic they are passionate about. For instance one time in my Filmmaking Class I got to complete an independent project on anything I wanted. My project was a film about cars, and for my entire life I have always loved cars and car movies. In doing this project I finally got to make my own car movie and in doing so I learned about a great deal about cars and film makingÂ it self. From how to make cars interesting to a viewer to how to film inside of one. This was an opportunity I was incredibly thankful for and will help me in my future of film making\n \n One could say that if a student is given too much free reign on a project during the summer they will not complete the project or will make a half baked one. This is not true as all people and all students learn differently and require different needs and when given the time and resources will make something great. For example for me they best way to learn is by doing it through something I am passionate about. Like I love to bake and in my eighthÂ grade civics class I got to make a cake about Presidential elections and because of they way I got to learn about it I still remember it to this day. This could be possible for every student if the project was more fitted for the students needs because that F average student could really be just struggling to learn and not out of laziness not completing the project but out of confusion or shame. As well as these projects would be during the summer the student would have even more time to practice and learn.\n \n Summer projects that students themselves are a great way for students to learn. From promoting independent thinking, to having the student learn about a topic they are interested in, and the student getting to learn in a way helpful to them. These could really help students in getting ready for a new school year and the rest of their lives as these are skills not easily forgotten.\n \n That is why schools should let student design their summer projects themselves.Â Â Â",

    essay: "A lotÂ of people argue that in school, the teachers know best and not the students. This has led many people to believe that summer school projects should be teacher-designed and not student-designed. Summer school projects should be student-designed because teaching methods evolve with each generation and it gives the student more confidence.\n \n An efficient teaching system would change the way it teaches in response to newer and smarter generations. For example, when computers were becoming common in the 80's and 90's, many schools adapted to using them to better teach their students. This made teaching much faster for both the teachers and the students. Because the students back then demanded change, almost every school in America now has computers in it.\n \n Students would be much more confident if they knew the assignment was designed by another student. One example is the SOL's tests in the state of Virginia. Many students would find it more convenient if the questions on the test were more modern or relatableÂ and made by someone closer to their age. Applying this to every test would significantly boost student performance. Also, there is a popular saying that goes, \"Great minds think alike.\" Students minds are more sharp than most teachers minds, therefore resulting in a more efficient assignment design system. Furthermore, this leaves the students with less stress, easing the massive load of pressure that modern schools apply on them.\n \n From a constant wave of smarter, brighter generations of students to just simple confidence; this is why summer school assignments should be student-designedÂ and not teacher-designed.

    essay: "Have you ever had to do a project over the summer for school. Well some schools have it as a requirement to do a project over the summer break. The project that is assigned by the school should be teacher designed. This is because when the students comeback to school there teachers design the projects that are given. Teachers know the specifc steps the students need to use to make sure they have the right information they need to get a good grade, and what information they are required to have on their projects. Also the teacher can design it around something the students do on a daily bases on summer break.\n \n First reason the teachers should design it because they design all the projects when the students comeback to school from summer break. I say this because the teachers are always making the plans, and creating the way the projects are done. This is shown when they give you a project they create those plans and requirements. It also shows where you can find the information about the subject that the project is on. The biggest thing about the teachers designing the project is that it is involved in what you are learning in the class that you have the project in.\n \n The second reason on why the teachers should design the projects is they know what information the students need to have on their projects. Also what specifc ways they can get the information without violating the rules of the projects. This is because students have access to all type information through the internet and other sources, but some sources are not correct. Websites on the internet are a prime example of getting false information, which could lead to getting a horrible grade on the project that is assigned. Also the teachers know the websites that are vaild because they go in and look through them carefully.\n \n Finally the teachers can design the project around something the students do everyday on summer break. This is because they know studnets on summer break are not going to do reading or writing a paper. So they just make it something easy like recored the weather for a two whole weeks. They also could make you track how long you sleep a day for a whole week.\n \n That is why teachers should design the summer break project. It is because they are going to have to make the projects when the sutudents comeback.Â",

    essay: "Teachers has given students an option for summer school, either they design their own project or the teacher design it for them..Students should be allowed to design their own summer project because they will understand it more, get it done right, and you will take your time on it.\n \n If students design there own project for the summer then they will understand it more. I say that because you go to summer school to get help that you couldn't get during school. So of courseÂ you will want a teacher to design a project for you to do. But if you find a project to do yourself you will see its much less complicated than the teachers. Plus you want have to listen to the teacher orders because its your own design.\n \n Another reason why is you will get it done right. If you designing your own project you shouldn't mess it up, it should be perfect. You have to trust in your self that you can do it right. I made a project on cars once I got a A+ on it becauseÂ I designed it myself so everything was perfect. Everything you do is not going to be perfect but when its your piece of work it should be close to A1.\n \n Lastly if you design your own summer project you will take your time on it. Lets be honest, most time when a teacher gives you a assignment that you don't like you will rush through it. If you are designing your own assignment then you will learn to take your time because you would want perfection to come from your own work. For example you won't have to worry about rushing on your research, finding your resources, and even decorating it. Everything is on your own time.\n \n In conclusion students should design there own summer projects to make it easier on themselves. They won't have to rush, it will be more understanding, and it should be a perfect project. Teachers want you to do things their way but sometimes you have to do your own thing.

    essay: "You don't attend school to instruct and educate yourself, you attend school to engage in subjects, activities, and to learn from unfamiliar and familiar experiences, provided to you by a well equip and trained instructor. Teachers are their to provided assignments that are challenging, engaging, and purposeful in helping you to advance and progress further in your academics. For the past two summers of high school, I have completed three Advance Placement assignments; overall, they've provided me with some structure and understanding of what i'll be learning throughout my courses, despite the long hours and reading that was sometimes boring. Although students have a greater understanding on what issues or topics will be interesting to engage in over the summer, teachers are experienced enough to know what topics would provided useful information. Summer projects shouldÂ be teacher-designed, because, teachers are trained, experienced, and disciplined about what topics would be best for their students.\n \n To become a teacher, you must attend multiple years of college and to learn and retain rigorous information that will advance them in their field of study. With this training, a teacher can formulateÂ a project that would provide: guidelines, broad or narrow overview of the course,meaningful and useful information about the course; therefore, it is imperative that a well trained individual such as a teacher, to design summer projects for students. A teacher will apply their knowledge of the course they have obtained and, assignÂ challenging and well suited subjects for their students to engage in over the summer. All of these factors contribute to a meaningful and effective summer project.\n \n \"The older you get, the wiser you are\", a popular quote that depicts one of life's greatest principles, experience. Simply, a student has less experience than a teacher in a course, solely because, the teacher has learned much further in depth through higher education. Teachers have completed numerous assignments, projects, and activities to know what will bring a greater understanding from their summer project. It is important for students to be protected from mistakes and failed attempts that happened to instructors in the past, hence, teachers should design summer projects.\n \n Although students are creative and strive to do their best, sometimes, they focus and complain about the difficulty and objective of the assignment rather than, facing challenging and rigorous assignments that are needed to comprehend the course. Overall, students lack the discipline needed to self instruct the best fitted assignments that will help grasp an understanding on the course work. Moreover, it is a summer project and many students would not design a project that will be time consuming and challenging; in fact, they will design a fast going project or something inefficient to the overall goal . Therefore, teachers are to be the enforcer and designer of the summer projects for students.\n \n Even though it would be fun and creative for students to have a part in designing their own summer projects, students must acknowledge their deficiency in areas needed to provided a well suited project. Teachers are the best and most fit for the task of designing summer projects due to numerous factors stated in the previous paragraphs. Students may know what they like, however, they lack the discipline, experience, and training to self instruct their summer assignments. Overall, Teachers are not obsolete to the learning process for students over the summer, they provide the structure and the enforcement that students need. Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â",

    essay: "Summer projects should be teacher designed. And for a multitude of reasons. But a couple of these reasons are Student designed projects wouldn't be challenging at all because they'd make them for their own conveinience if they'd even design one, and also the teachers know what is going to be taught in the future for the class so they can accurately design the project to cater to that, and the students can't.\n \n I'm a student and I know if I was ever given the opportunity to design my own summer project I'd try to make it as easy possible, and I know many of my fellow classmates would try to do the same. It's just how teenagers think matter of fact it's how most people think. If you can design your own work for yourself why make it harder for yourself that's just simple logic. In class students often say things like \" If I was in charge there'd be no school\" or \" If I could make the test I would make evry question 1 + 1\". Comments like these that I hear everyday in class are exactly why students can't be responsible for making they're own assignments, because they won't learn. Some of my friends are always looking for the easy way out of things and I presume that their are other kids out there like them so them designing their own work wouldn't work. I feel that kids should think this way simply becaus we're kids and this is how our brain works. This is a very important reason for why kids can't can't design summer projects it wouldn't make tham any smarter because they'd be designing the projects to their own convenience.\n \n Teachers know what they are going to teach in that year the lesson plan for the entire year is provided to them by the state. The student's do not, they're there to learn and to learn only. So the idea that the students would design a project is absolutely ludacris! Why would they do what their parents pay the teachers to do through tax money? If the students made the projects the projects wouldn't help them at all because they'd have no idea what they'd be learning and the idea that they'd know what their learning because they're in that class gets thrown out the window because its a summer project, only the teacher knows what's taught in that upcoming year. I think students should focus on learning and teachers should focus on teaching their shouldn't be any sort of role reversal because that just complicates things. Also teachers are their to teach the students it clearly states that in their job description. Having students design their own work just clearly sets them up to fail because they don't have the knowledge to know what knowledge they need to gain in order to be succesful.\n \n On the other hand I can see how people could have an argument for why kids designing their own summer projects could be a good thing. Students know what goes on in their minds and what certain work they need to address specific issues. Essentially they know themselves better than teachers do, and them designing their own project could cater to their specific needs and problems. Also a few of my friends have told me that when their teacher lets them design their own projects and assignments they feel like they know and understand the material better. In addition studets designing their own projects could mean less backlash for the schools incase parents get mad about summer projects being too hard, because the students in that school designed that project not the teachers.\n \n In conclusion students should not design their own projects because if it were left up to them they wouldn't learn anything and the project wouldn't be serious, and students don't know what is being taught in the class so they don't have the capacity to create their own work. This shouldn't even be a real question because it's very obvious that students shouldn't be designing their own projects they are there to learn from the professional which is the teacher not try and be the professionals themselves.",

I think it should be teacher-designed because they came up with this idea so, they should have some designs thought of another reason why i think it should be teacher designed is that teachers have more experince of doing projects then students so, they should have alot of examples of projects for students to do and the last reason is students are on summer break if the students have to think of design to do they probably will forget or not do it but if a teacher gives them the design of the project to do they will do it quick and then enjoy there summer break.\n \n Firstly, the teachers came up with this idea of giving students a summer project so, they can contine learning durning their break they should have some designs for the students for their projects. For example, my brother and I work at kroger and when we are off work our job still want us to be good citizens so they sign us up to feed the homeless and bring clothes to the shelters. Our job want my brother and i be good citizens at all times so, they gives us examples how to show them that we are good citizens.\n \n Secondly, teachers have more experince then students at projects so, they should have designs thought of for students. For example, my father was a boyscout member for 5 years and he know how to make different types of toy cars so, i had a project at school i had to design a toy car and my dad had experince at toy cars so he gave me alot of designs to do and i did the easiest one. People who have experince can help the other person who doesn't have no experinceat at all.\n \n Lastly, it is summer break students don't think about school if the students have to think of a design to do they will not do it but if the teacher give them a design for the project the students will do it quick for they can enjoy there sumer break. For example, Im a student at Generic_School if we had to design a project on summer break and i had to come with a design it would not have been done because we on summer break i don't think about school but if a teacher gives me a design i will to do it on first day of summer so, i don't have worry about the project trust me alot of students think a like so they will do the same some students don't even do home work and you think they will do a summer project.\n \n The teacher should design the project because they came up with idea so,they should have some designs, they have more experince then students at projects so they should have alot of designs to share, students are on summer break if they have to come up with a design they will not do it. If we had to this at my school nobody will do it because we don't think about work whatever school does this is a bad school.",

If I had a project to do over summer break I would prefer it to be made up by me.\n \n We understand that teachers and schools want us to keep learning over summer, but a lot of the times many people go out of the country, visit family, do not have internet access, and etc. So, if students had the ability to choose their own project, they could do it based off what they have available over the summer. We all have to take our course classes in school, where we already do lots of learning on those specific subjects. So why not for a change, change it up. Give students the chance to choose their own topic. Maybe something they do not have a class for at school or something that really interests them.\n \n Student-designed projects would give students more of a broad area to find an idea. If a teacher were to design the project, most student'sÂ projects would all be the same. Having the students create their projects will give a wider variety of projects and topics. If having to present, other students could find out an interest they never knew they had. For example: I have been learning about the wars since around 6th grade, so if that was what my project would be on, I would be very bored writing about it because, it is something that I have talked about for almost six years. But if I was given the opportunity to write about something I want to write about, I would choose forensics, because we do not have a class about it at school but it is something that I am highly interested in and want to know more about.\n \n Statistics from Harvard University in 2019 say, \"93% of students have gotten better grades on self-made projects rather than ones handed by teachers.\" More students believe that when they are given the choice to choose a topic and make a project based off what they like and what they prefer, they receive a higher score. Self-designed projects give the students a chance to explore their interests and create something that is meaningful and custom made by them. No one wants to do the same project as everyone else, it is time to be unique! We do lots of projects throughout the school year that everyone else in the class does, so why not have summer be the one time we create something special to us.\n \n So tell me what is your project going to be about if you had that chance? Take this chance to be creative, find something that really sparks your interest, or whatever is available to you. Studies even showed you will do better when your project is self-designed. You have 185 days in your summer vacation then school comes around just to end it. Find a good way to spend it, do your project but enjoy it.Â",

    essay: "Summer break is usually a time for fun and a break from school. Things like partying, vacation, working, and sleep are what most students tend to do on their break. During that time they aren't learning any new material which could cause a lot of problems going into the future. Some schools have started to give students summer projects that will help the students keep learning while on break. I believe those projects should be teacher-designed projects. Having the oppurnity to learn the same way you learn inside school without actually being in school, it gives students guidance and details about what should be done, which makes it easier for students, and would make it easier for the teachers to grade.\n \n Since I was in middle school I have been told that I had summer reading projects to do over my summer break. Summer reading is a teacher-designed project in which I choose a book off of a list, read it, and write an essay on so that they when I go back to school it could be graded by my teacher. Ever since Middle School students would do those projects so they wouldn't have a bad grade when they get back to school. They knew the summer reading project would get brought up and they wouldn't want to start of the new school year wrong. Summer reading helps students in English over the summer because they're reading a whole book and writing an essay on it after. That's basically the exactly same thing that we do in school! Teachers could guide the students through the emails and papers on how do to certain things meaning besides being face to face with the educator; your really just right back in class doing another project.\n \n Giving students something that outlines everything their supposed to do and how they're toldÂ to do it will make everything on everybody way easier. For some students it would be hard for them to come up with their own idea and for others it may not. Some students may already have something in their mind but other may not even know where to start. I meaning just making up a project out of thin air is going to be very hard considering we are still young and on summer break. Teacher- designed assignments could make would make it easier for students to know what they need to do all they way down to the detail which would make it easier for students to just do it like its normal. Having something laid out in front of you letting you know how to something will help the student stay focused on learning and help them get a good grade for the upcoming school year. While making them think about their on designed project could lead to stress and probably procrastination. They would have to think about all of their own little details notÂ knowing exactly what their supposed to be aiming for or compare it to. Thats very difficult for a student to do while trying to balance having fun on summer vacation, and more time than none of the time they'll just forget the project and go have fun. Now some people may say that students should learn responsibility, that they should focused on the job at hand and if they don't then they have to face the consequence. But knowing that i've already spent months in schools and i've picked up their traits along the way I am not trying to have to force myself to do anything in the time that I am free from school. Thinking that they've done work all year giving by a teacher in the time they have to do the work why stop now at a time when we don't even have school.\n \n Teachers now-days make most of their worksheets that they give out to the students. If they didn't make it personally then they got it from a website. Here's the thing though teachers make assignment that they know how to complete themselves and that they know how to grade. Having teacher-designed projects makes it some much easier on the teachers. They know how to grade the work, also they know what they are looking for. They aren't just making up random points to make up for certain people based on the type of project they did. They would have a structured organizer to go off of. Making it easier for students to just go with whats being told and easier for the teacher that just has a certain way of grading that can work for all students. Meaning no student can say that was done wrong because the way they were graded. All the students will be graded on the same things making everything clear and straight to the point. Just like it is during the school and which makes the grading promise for worksheet go so smooth.\n \n Having teachers designed projects for students during their summer will all around make things simple for everyone. Teachers can easily continue to do what they've been doing and students can get what they need to pass. Making time for students to still have fun while they are on break while keeping them educated. They are meaning reasons to why teacher desinged is the smartter choice and many reason why its may not be even though I don't think so.Â  Â Â  Â Â  Â Â",

    essay: "Lest be real to ourselves, when teachers assigned students to complete a summer project, the majority will end up leaving it to a side and they will prefer to focus in other activities that they may have fun. Why? But why not?. The idea of students designed their own summer projects is valid because it will be less stressful for them and it will assure that the student complete it.\n \n First, its a real fact that students dont like school at all; since they start students cant wait for their next break, so give them more work to do during their break will end up making them feel a lotÂ of stress that can affect their social, personal or educative life. But, if they had the a chance to select their own projects, it can become a fun or interesting assignment for them because it will be of their choice.\n \n Students usually believe that the majority of what they can learn at school is not even important for the real world; so students decide to just not complete the work teachers assigned and they start doing what they think its better for them. But if schools allowed students to designed their summer projects, it will make sure that they can focus more on what its real important for them; and it will be a joyful feeling for students to finish their assignment that they made.\n \n Finally, students when they're during summer break, they're really focusing on personal goals and having some joyful time. By letting them to designed their own summer projects will assure that its completed and it will be less mental stress for them. However, teachers have to make sure that those summer projects will be teaching them the correct things.Â Â Â Â",

    essay: "Summer projects are beneficial for learning. Students should design their own projects over the summer because they have time, can work with friends, and are educated about the subject. Some state that teachers should design the project because they have more experience and better planning, but this is false. Although some may disagree, students should design their own projects over the summer.\n \n There are many reasons why this decisions should be made. Students manage their time in the summer differently making the designing process easier. They can use information they've learned previously in the school year when designing the project, helping the students gain time management skills. They can also choose their own topic allowing them to be informed of what they're designing. When a student picks a topic they enjoy, the final product will display a large amountÂ of effort and dedication\n \n There are further reasons why students should be able to design their own projects. Students get help from their friends who generate ideas for the students designing the project. Friends also help better the bonds they from with the students while spending time designing the project. Students can get help from their family member who help educate them, teach them new tactics, and purchase necessary materials required that the students cant afford. Lastly, students can go onlineÂ to locate sources they can use to gather information while designing; furthermore, the students can locate articles provided by verified authors.\n \n When students design their own project , they are in control. They gain skills through designing with the help from friends, family, and the internet. Students who design their own project gain skills they will forever use.",

    essay: "A big issue in the school system is the question as to how to keep students working their brains over summer break. Many students find themselves or their peers to be stuggling with their work when they return to school in the Fall. A great number of schools have found success in assigning projects for each student to complete throughtout their break to ensure children to excercise their brains. The debate over summer projects is whether the assignment would be more beneficial if it were designed by teachers or the students themselves. Summer projects should be student-designed in order to provide oppertunities for creativity and independent studies, contibuting to important life skills.\n \n Allowing students to design a project specific to their interests encourages the student to express a creative process. The initial task of choosing a project requires the student to get creative with their resources based on what they find interesting. This process is critial to forming skills such as decision making and reasoning. Creating the project itself provides multiple levels of creativity and self expression for the student. Without a general project outline, the student will have to come up with ideas completely personal and relevant to themself. With the wide variation of projects produced from peer to peer, little input from other students will affect each others work. Enabling the students to set focus on topics and presentations personal to themselves sets the class up fo success by introducing crutial skills of creativity and hardwork.\n \n Student-designed projects will put students in a position to work and study independently, providing skills for future education and career paths. Many projects in the workplace consist of due dates in the future, leaving the employee responsible for time management and execution of the project. It is the responsibility of the employee or student to choose a project reasonable for time provided and work required. Projects that are student-designed will help form these skills so students can maximize them later in their careers. A student-designed project will allow students to work and study independently, leaving them solely responsible for their research and production of their project. Learning at a younger age to be acountable for their assignments will benefit the work ethic of the students in the future. While it may be a concern that students would choose a project too simple for their skill level or without much hark work behind it, a set of standards from a rubric could guide the students in the right direction to complete a challenging project on their own and gain important life skills through it.\n \n Assigning students student-designed projects will benefit students by encouraging hard work, creativity, and life skills. It is important to give students the option for independent and self designed work to push students to use their skills and succeed in future oppertunities of education and career paths.Â",

    essay: "Some schools require students to complete summer projects in order for students to continue learning during their break; these projects, however, should be designed by students. Instead of sitting in a boring room and having no say in planning a project, students should plan them themselves. Allowing students to design their own summerÂ projects makes projects more interesting and enjoyable.\n \n Allowing students to plan their own projects gives the students more freedom to use their creativity. When students plan their own projects, students have the opportunity to decide what they want their projects to be. For example, some students may want to their project to be a science fair. If they had the freedom to plan out their science fair, they would be in control; which would allow them be able to plan about what each person could present at the science fair or even when the science fair will take place. In turn, it could allow students to be creative and enjoy themselves. Allowing students to design their own projects give students the freedom to decide for themselves.\n \n While allowing students to design their own projects give students the freedom to express their creativity, it also shows that they are responsible. When they design their own projects, they show that they are able to make responsible decisions. For example, the students that wanted their project to be a science fair might have to consider where the science fair will take place and what type of concessions will be there. These are the decisions that the students will think about when they plan there science fair, and will result in proving their critical thinking skills and responsible decision-making. When students have the ability to plan out their own projects, they can be responsible enough to make good and smart decisions.\n \n However, there are those who disagree and state that students should not plan their own projects because there would be too much responsibility for the students to handle; there would also be too much freedom and students can take a negative advantage or abuse that freedom. On the contrary, the students would not have too much responsibility due to there being a large body of students pitching in ideas. As a result, there would not be too much responsibility on only one student or a small section of students. Another reason why these statements are false is because with a large amount of freedom, student can be a lot more creative when designing projects.\n \n In conclusion, students who participate in summer projects, that is required by school, should be able to plan these projects themselves. Eventhough some may disagree, their statements are false. If more summer projects were designed by students instead of teachers, more students would enjoy and appreciate summer projects a lot more.Â",

    essay: "Imagine. Summer is here, and the dreadful school year is finally over. You're prepared to grab your swimsuits and go to the beach and actually enjoy your time off from learning. However, your blissful period is interrupted with anguishing agony as you realize you were assigned a summer project to complete. We've all been there, mourning over the fact that we received one more assignment to do for school. We are reluctant to start the projects as they seem pointless and a form of busywork for us; however, summer projects are designed to assure continuous learning through engaging tasks. Although teacher-designed projects can be seen as desirable, summer projects should be student-designed as it helps foster creativity and self-reliance.\n \n One reason why summer projects should be student-designed is the fact that it fosters creativity. Giving students the freedom to learn about topics that interests them far outweighs the notion of just finishing an assignment. In my high school experience, I tend to remember projects that I was truly interested in, rather than the monotonous ones designed by teachers (that solely get work out of you). Projects are meant to be engaging, so that later down in life you can recall the learning experience. This difference proves that creative work fosters quality rather than quantity. Furthermore, a teacher-designed project inhibits a student's potential to express their creative mindset. By receiving a topic and a guideline on how one should complete a project, a student becomes mentally set on pursuing that one path, disregarding all other options. This mental block of creativity can be harmful to a growing teenager as the advancement of society is dependent on creative thinkers which student-designed projects help create.\n \n Another reason why summer projects should be student-designed is the fact that it engages students to be self-reliant. Given the freedom to pursue one's take on a subject, helps foster self-confidence. In my high schoolÂ experience, doing a personal research that was interesting really helped create a sense of pride and accomplishment. Being confident leads to trusting one's ability rather than relying on others;and in our competitive society for careers, self-reliance is extremely important. Furthermore, allowing students to pursue their own designs lets them mature into adulthood. The apex of self reliance is adulthood and self learning is meant to teach and prepare students for their future. By removing the dependency of a teacher when doing a project, self support truly shines through, giving students hands on experienceÂ on the hallmark of adulthood. This is similar to the concept of parents not supporting a baby for too long so they can learn to walk on their own.\n \n In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed rather than teacher-designed as it fosters creativity and self-reliance. Given the freedom to pursue their own path, students not only learn more effectively but also become more unique. Letting students be unique allows for a desirable diverse community in which society becomes enriched by. Therefore, everyone should aim for topics that interest them when they are given the chance, as that is when humanity truly learns at its best.",

It gives them an opportunity to pick something they really love learning about and it helps the teacher get to know them better.\n \n They're most likely to put a lot more effort into the project. For example, you were just assigned a project and the topic on it was something you absolutely hated you're not going to want to do the project or put much effort in it and you're going to get bored with it.\n \n It's something positive for students to do during the summer.

    essay: "For most students, summer is the best time for students to relax and release the stress that they endured during the torturous school year. However, some students are required to complete summer projects to make sure the knowledge that they have attained from those nine or ten months of school doesn't leak out of their brains. This is not a bad thing because it allows for teachers to know what they should focus on for the new year when these students come back. Summer projects should be designed by teachers because the summer projects will be graded by teachers, teachers already have the knowledge about the curriculum, and students will be too lazy to want to design a project for their summer.\n \n Summer projects should be designed by teachers because, in the end, teachers are going to be the ones grading it. Grading things, often, take a lot of time from teachers. However, the time it takes to grade could change by the subject that the teacher is grading.\n \n For example, a math teacher could take two or three days to grade all of their students' math tests. On the other hand, English teachers could take a week to a month to grade essays for all of their students. Projects take a long to do because the purpose is to see what the student knows overall and allow them learn things they didn't know before. Teachers are going to grade these projects at the beginning of the year, but they are also expected to begin teaching students new information of the course and grade other things assigned to put in the grade for first quarter. It would be stressful for the teacher if the students were able to design a project that would barely passed the minimum effort expected or if the students design a project that far and beyond. It would be a chaos for teachers to grade. Therefore, teachers should be able to design a project that they believe would allow them to efficiently grade at a faster pace.\n \n The people that should design the summer assignments are the people that know the subject of the summer projects the best and those people are teachers. It easy to say that designing a project is easy. However, it's difficult to find the resources and plan out a project that would effectively help new students learn the information they need for the new year. It will be difficult for new students to make a project on what they don't know. Teachers, on the other hand, know about the subject and the important things that students should focus on. They know websites, videos, movies, documents, or other resources that are helpful to students. For example, I had an AP United States summer project that I had to do in the summer of 2019. The teacher give us YouTube links to watch from and made us practice how to write different types of essays. The project wasn't boring. It taught people a lot of useful skills by allowing them to watch videos and reading sources. I learned a lot of things that I didn't know before. This example shows that teachers already have the information to make a good summer project that allows new students to learn effectively.\n \n Honestly, students are too lazy to want to design a project. If a student is too lazy to do a summer project, why would they want to make a summer project that will be source of their suffering and anxiety for the summer? For example, I had an English book that I was suppose to read in the summer of 2018. I did not even read a page in that chosen book. It was the easiest summer project ever and I was too lazy to even do that. Students want to have fun during their summer. They don't want to design a project for their summer. People could argue that designing a project is fun or if a student designed a summer project then they could make it be easy. However, the project will never be truly \"student-designed' because teachers and schools will have a requirement of what is suppose to be on the project that students will be designing. Also, summer projects are for new students. These new students know nothing to very little information about the new subject that they will be taking for the upcoming year. If teachers or the school expects students to do research on the subject to make their summer project. They might as well just make their own summer project because either way the student is gonna be force to learn something new. It will only be more work for the student to design a project for the summer that they will have little information about or they won't even be able to do it because they won't be in the class next year.\n \n In conclusion, teachers should be the ones designing summer projects because they know the most about the subject, they're going to grade these projects, and students are too lazy to design a project. People can argue that a student can still design a summer project and make it enjoyable, even with teachers' requirements. However, it would be so difficult for teachers and students because teachers will be forced to make requirements of what should be on the summer project and be forced to see if the summer project is effective. Students will be forced to make a summer project for new students and not for them because they're going to move to a different grade or subject the next year. Unless new students are making it. However if new students make it, they won't even know what are the important things that should be on the project or how to most effectively gather the information. It'll be too difficult, therefore teachers should just design the projects themselves.",

    essay: "The end of summer is coming and you're required to complete a project, before going back to school. Some claim that a teacher designed project is more sensible rather than a student designed project,I think a student designed project is better because the teachers provide boring topics,students get the freedom to choose whatever, and let's the students show there creativity.\n \n A student designed project, would be better because teachers provide students with boring topics;If the topics the teachers gave us wasn't boring than students would show more excitementÂ towardsÂ the subject as a whole. Such as students don't want to be forced to do a project on something they don't really care about,teachers give out boring topics and expect high tier work from students. Teacher designed project would only be sensible if and only if the student had no idea what to do there project on.\n \n Giving the students an option to design there own projects opens the door for them to show off there creativity. Students rarely get to show there creativity in anything,but if the project was a student based design then the project would be completed at a higher standard compared to a teacher based design. Student based designs would go more in depthÂ with the project giving the audience a true visual on what the student is trying to show compared to a followed rubric that a teacher gave to you.\n \n Last but not least,a student based project shows the teachers your'e capable of usingÂ self thinkingÂ skills. Showing your'e teacher you know how to use certain skills,such as giving them information on things you need to improve on and things your already good at.\n \n some have claimed that teachers know whats best for the students,but I thought otherwise as the boring topics they give us,not letting us show our creativity and last but not least our self thinking skills.

    essay: "Summer Projects\n \n I feel that students should be able to plan there own projects over the summer rather than teachers giving them projects themselves. My reasoning be that students can be creative when making thee own projects and using there own ideas. My second reason is that students can complete it over time and do it at there own pace to know they completedÂ the project correctly and finished it in the way tat they like it. My last reason is that it enables that students to have a open mind, rather than being controlled or having to use someone else's ideas.\n \n The main reason why students should be able to design there own projects is so they can be creative. When students follow what a teacher wants they cant always be open minded. If students use there own ideas and make there own projects it allows for the student to be open minded and be more creative while doing the project. When using there own ideas it lets the students be more focused and have a more original idea. If all the students get told to do the same thing it makes the teacher have to grade the same project over and over. Rather than grading different projects that are more interesting and different.\n \n The second best reason students should make there own projects over the summer is so they have as much time to do them as needed. Usually in class the teachers set a date for the projects to be due by which leaves the students stressed. When they dont have a lot of time students tend to rush threw the project not being able to complete it all in the time given. Bu if the students use threw own ideas and make it threw outÂ the summer it makes the projects more entertaining for the student to make and lets them complete the project on there own time.\n \n My last reason students should make there own projects is so that they have fun with it. Most of the time when you have to follow a piece of paper given to you by the teacher it leave the students bored and has them repeat the same information over and over. Rather than them making there own projects an having fun while doing so. It leaves the field of ideas moreÂ open when you can go off the things you know rather than looking it up on Google and always having to listen to a teacher. When you let the student use the information they know it allows the student to the type of person they really are which lets the teacher know what interest them and motivates them to maybe switch things p in class while doing assignments like those.\n \n In conclusion I think that students should be allowed to make there own projects rather than having to listen toÂ a teacher or have to follow a form. My reasons being that it lets the student be more creative and have them be more interesting. I allows the student the have fun with it and makes it more interesting for the teacher to grade. Lastly it gives the student more time to complete the project when they do it own there own and enables them to finish it correctly and not be stressed out. Thats why students should make their own projects.Â Â Â",

    essay: "If some schools require students to do summer projects over their break, how can one insure that students will complete it if it were designed by a teacher? Students never want to do work over the summer, but if its a requirement it should at least be something that intrigues them. If the project is teacher-designed many students probably wouldnt like the assignment that the teacher assigns them over their break. which leads to a possibility of many students not doing the project at all. Students dont want to have a project that'll be confusing and time consuming to them. They would rather have something that can be productive and fun. A student-designed project allows for: students to be more interested in their project, to have a project designed by students will be more intriguing, and students can work together creatively to create something that'll help them to continue learning over the summer.\n \n Many students like doing things that interest them, it makes them enjoy what they're working on. If the summer project is student-designed. It will be something that they create, not something that a teacher made up and gave to their students to give them a hard time over break. It's indeed a way for them to learn but its not how a student would want to learn. Students want to learn during their break with something that doesn't bore them. They want something that can keep them entertained and want them to keep learning. overall a student learns better when they're fully committed to it and want to put their focus on, especially if its designed by them.\n \n Almost all teachers know that students enjoy working together, students are very creative and intelligent, thats why having them design a project like this strengthens the reasoning behind why these summer projects should be student-designed as compared to being teacher-designed. Does one really believe that students enjoy doing projects that are designed by a teacher, no, students enjoy doing things their way, something that can relate to them and understand a lot better. For example, a student would prefer working together with other students to create something fun for them to do over their time off, as opposed to being restricted to do work over summer by ones teacher, with boring ways of learning; therefore, leaving students demoralized. Students always perform well when on topic and working together, if a students can come up with something creative together. It'll make them feel comfortable with completing this summer project; furthermore, allowing them to continue learning through a unique, fun, and creative assignment.\n \n In conclusion, a student-designed project would: intrigue students, make them more interested in it, and it allows them to work together. Having students design a project for them to do over the summer would increase student productivity over their time off. Therefore enabling that student to continue learning and maintaining their intellect. Most teachers try to relate to students but they cant, having a teacher-designed project wouldnt be as a effective as having one designed by a student. The amount of creativity that a student has in ones mind is overwhelming. Students work best with others and together they can create enjoyable tasks for themselves. The probability of a student doing a student-designed project is much higher as compared to a teacher-designed project. Summer projects will be more enjoyable and interesting if it were designed by students instead of teachers.",

Teachers know exactly what to require on the project, as well as what key points to make sure they go over so when the next school year starts,students' brains will already be soaking up information throughout that summer. it won't be new to them when the school year starts. usually without any project or learning tools set in pace during the summer, students brains will practically lose a majority of the information from the previous year, it is very important to have your brain always functioning as well as feeding it more information daily.\n \n If students were to design the project, they could possibly not have the correct information on it, or just not enough information. one students education level should not be applied to the project because every students can know a little more, or know a little less of a subject and could use the practice. teachers should be required to design the project so it can be beneficial to the student, it can be a little challenging, just enough to get your brain functioning and really thinking, and so all the information provided is from a broad understanding of all the students weak spots, as well as their stronger spots.Â",

    essay: "Student Summer Projects\n \n During the summer we all have receive some sort of project or assignment that would be due during the first week of school. However, the projects are always assigned by teachers on what they think that is best for us. Not all students are pleased with the fact that we have to do work during the break. Considering that they just went to school for almost ten months and still have teachers think about what the students should do during summer break it's not fair. In my opinion I think that teachers should let students choose their own summer projects because they can have fun while making the project, turn the project however they like into something creative and have them be motivated. Summer is the time to not stress about assignments that are complicated. Instead it should have the student be interesting to have something to do so they can remember the memories they made while making the project.\n \n Summer time is the time where students can be stress-free and just have fun with friends and family. Including the fun activities they enjoy doing. That should be the main idea of a summer project because letting students decide how they want to do their own projects will keep them motivated on doing it because they can express their creative minds onto something they know they won't get judged on. For example, Most people even without having to do a school project, majority of teenagers want to document their summer to show everybody what they did, to remember the amazing sunsets or sunrises throughout summer or the cool places they went too and family events that happened. As well with trying new thing that you didn't think you would enjoy but by the help of thee summer project you made , you learned a lot more about yourself. Either by the help of a friend or by just finding new activities that interested you by reading it or by seeing a commercial. Students want to share every detail of it because it was something they experienced during those two months that made them happy and not feel over whelmed with stress that was over their heads because of a boring assignment their previous teacher assigned them before school ended.\n \n In addition, while students are making the project they can work individually. Some may feel more motivated to think outside of the box on what your whole topic should be or how they can make it happen. However, with a group project you can work with friends make it even more adventurous. Some students may think differently instead of going out they can make an invention or make something from scratch, the possibilities are endless because it would be up to the student to create something unique that teachers may not have thought of before.\n \n When teachers design projects sometimes it isn't the type of projects that we all expect. You can't really be creative because majority of the time they will give you a template of the important things you should actually do and it just gets rid of the fun of doing the project because you're only doing what it is asking you to do. As well with having teachers design the project it wouldn't make much sense because you passed all your classes as well with the grade you just passed. During the summer you don't have any teachers that you're enrolled in yet in their class. That's the main reason why I think it shouldn't be up to the teachers to design and have the students instead .\n \n In conclusion, I strongly think that summer projects should be student-designed rather than having teachers designed the project because summer is the time where even if you're a teacher student, principle. It is your summer and your own experience. You should at least as a student have the control of what you're own summer project should be about during your summer break because it is where you mostly spend time with family and friends just enjoy everybody's time. Also it helps you think in many ways on how you can make your summer the best one yet by doing many activities or starting new hobbies just because of this project and learn yourself at most by just having fun. A project doesn't have to be boring, you just have to find what interests you and what helps you keep motivated.\n \n .Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â",

    essay: "Many students tend to forget things they learned at school, in the summer. During summer, teenagers are out having fun and taking a break from school. Although the school year is over, students should not lose focus on what is important. Since teens need to keep focus, a summer project would be the perfect task for them. Summer projects should be designed by their up coming teacher because students will get familiarized with what they will learn, teachers will assign projects that will be beneficial to their students, and teachers will have a criteria showing students what to look for.\n \n To begin with, going into a new school year, no one really knows what the year will be like. Having a summer project allows students to have some knowledge on what the new year might bring. For example, if Generic_School made students do one summer project it would not only help their grade for the first quarter, but also show them know what they willÂ learn. Although there will be students who will not do the projects, there will also be people who will complete them because they are serious and focused on school. Students who work hard and want to be successfulÂ in life will see that summer projects given to them will be beneficial to them.\n \n Additionally, teachers know what is best for their students. A prime example here at Generic_School is a geometry teacher, although she assigns a handful of work, she knows that if the students completes it, it will be extremely helpful to them. Most of time students will complain about the amount of work a teacher might give them but in the long runÂ it will help them tremendously. Teachers giving out projects to do in the summer may sound dreadful but it will, undoubtedly help them. To add on teachers will always tell students what to look for and give them a rubric to help them.\n \n As a matter of fact, teachers will never assign a student a project and not give them a rubric. Often times, students will argue and pout about a project, but when a teacher gives their students a rubric and the criteria of the project, it makes it twice as much easier. Students who are serious about school and want to bring up their GPA will not complain about one measly summer project. Also, summer projects will never be too hard, since the school year has not yet started. Teachers will most likely tell their students what to do and how to do it. Even though the projects assigned to students may be easy, some may complain about the subject and want to do a project on a subject they choose.\n \n While some students may prefer to do a summer project on what they want. The pros to this would be that they are actually interested in the subject and more motivated about it. They would also, most likely get a better grade on something they are genuinelyÂ concerned about. For example, if a student loved the ocean, they would be more excited doing a project on marine life or how unique the ocean is than doing a project about different rocks. Although this may be true, teacher-designed projects would be more beneficial than a student choosing their own subject.\n \n To conclude, teacher-designed projects would be more productive for students than student-designed projects. It gives students the opportunity to learn a little before the school year starts. Teachers will assign students projects that will be helpful to them. Also, the projects would not be extremely hard because the teacher is essentially telling students how to complete the project. Schools should allow teachers to assign the students projects to do in the summer because it will help them a great deal more than students choosing their own projects.Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â",

    essay: "A summer project is suppose to show teachers what you learned over the past 9 months in his/her classroom. that's why they invented the project and some students never do it which could hurt their grade at the start of the first nine weeks. Students should not be able to design this project because some students might make the project too easy and some students might just be lost and confused after the fact that they got help from a teacher.\n \n The first reason why students shouldn't be able to design this summer project is because students would just make the project about an easy subject like art or gym and it might not be so helpful to teachers. students like to sleep in class or be on their phones and most of them students are going to be the ones lost on how to do this project which is 50% of students in each classroom. If the students were allowed to design the summer project it would fail because student lack the skills needed to create the project they don't know what to make the project about and some of the students still wouldn't do the project because they feel as if they learned a lotÂ already during the school year. If you want students to design the summer project the teachers should give them rules to follow and a list of things that are inappropriate for school and not allowed to be on the project. many students would continue to struggle with school work if they design their own projects because its not helping them get better on that subject for school.\n \n Another reason why teachers should design the project is because they would help the students get better with the subjects they struggle on the most in school. teachers can design projects to help students get better with work in school and if students where to be in control of this project they would make the project about something off topic or something that is not about what they learned in school. the whole reason for this project is so that students can show the schools what they learned over the years and show them that they are still learning over the summer time and not just playing around. Im still a student and i want to graduate and summer is three months away if my teachers were to give me a project and tell me to design it i would make it about my favorite subject in school which is history but some students like to play around and skip class and school to hang out with friends so they don't learn anything and when it comes time to do the project they are confused and lost on how to do the project the point is if students don't want to do the school work in school what is going to make them do the summer project so some students are going to take a zero for the grade because they don't care about their grades or the school.\n \n The project should be about what students learned not a copy of their friends work. some students like to share thier work with others and it could get them both in trouble. the point is some students are going to cheat off each other so they can get a good grade on the project if they was to be in control of the design. teachers should give the students a list of things that are good for the project to be about because if they dont they are just going to be turning in some work that isnt about school work they learned or even school at all. Teachers need to be the ones to design this project just like all the other ones they made why would they switch it up all of a sudden now?.\n \n A summer project is suppose to tell teachers you learned a thing or two while sitting in their classroom how would the students who didnt pay attention during class do the project?. these are all reason why teachers should design the summer project and not the students.",

    essay: "Over the summer, some schools require students to complete one summer project to keep their brains active and continue learning during the break. Teachers have the ability to assign their students what their project should be. However, it can be argued that students should be the ones that get to choose their topic for the summer project. Students should be able to pick their own summer project because they get to share what they are passionate about, have more control over the process, learn how to be self reliant.\n \n Students should be able to pick a topic based on their interests instead of a teacher assigned topic. Students will have a better attitude and work ethic if they can do a project that reflects and shares what they are passionate about. They will also show more dedication and time put into their projects because students will care to make sure the information is accurate and not misrepresented. Students will be more proud of the work and research they have accomplished for a project that they choose and find appealing instead of a topic from a teachers choosing.\n \n If students are given the ability to choose their own topic, they will have more control over their process and what they want to research. For example, students can start out with something as simple as a bottle rocket and decide what they want to do with it. They could do a project on fuel types or materials and have control over what they want to use or discover. This could also help students to easily restart a new project of they are have difficulty researching their current topic. In contrast, if students are having problems with teacher picked topics, they have to figure out how to do the project some other way and do not have the ability to switch. Allowing students to pick their topic is better so students have more control over their project.\n \n When students are required to pick their topic, they will not only learn how to take responsibility for their work,Â but will also learn how to meet a deadline by doing a little bit of work every day in order to receive a good grade. Students also will learn self reliance and work on their own if every student picks an individual topic. If teachers pick students topics, there is the possibility of students copying others work that may have the same topics. If students choose their own topics, they will learn to become self reliant by showing their own work and findings.\n \n The biggest downside to students picking their own topic is that teachers grading summer projects or presentation may not understand the work or topic from a project the student has dedicated the summer to. If teachers picked the topic for students to focus on, they would have prior knowledge of the topic and know that students can successfully complete the project from other students that might. But this could be avoided by having students submit their topic online over the summer so teachers know what they can do to be prepared. Students can then meet with three or four teachers, one of which could be someone with some prior knowledge of the topic, and students can go more in depth into their project. Teachers can ask questions making it more like a discussion that the student can lead instead of a student presenting to a class of their peers.\n \n If schools assign summer projects, students should be the ones who select their research topic so that they will be more excited and eager to share what they have learned, they will have more control over the management of their project, and they will learn to take responsibility for their work. Overall, students will take more pride in work they have done if they choose what they want to research.",

Certain schools require student to complete these for programs that students are in. Some students may have difficulties with these projects based on how they're designed while others have ease. Summer projects should be teacher-designed and not student-designed because of equal opportunities, it aids students to be prepared for their next school year, and its another way to assess growth.\n \n First, summer projects should be teacher-designed to ensure that students get equal opportunities.

    essay: "Many students can argue the fact that we would want to have our summer available and free. Not loaded with all of these projects that future teachers will assign to us. But have you ever thought about the reason why teachers do this? It's to give insight and a general observation about how the class that you signed up for will be like. Teachers don't give these projects to ruin our summer. In fact, a lot of them would much rather have us enjoy our summer. However, students need intellect about the class that they should eventually be prepared for. 3 months is a lot of time to forget about the material that you previously learned. Which is why I believe that having summer projects that are teacher-designed would be more beneficial to the graduating students. Teacher-designed projects will prevent students from not learning properly, memory loss and provide teachers an insight about what to teach.\n \n To start off, every student would much agree to ban and/or make summer projects optional. Including myself. But we, as students, never realized the benefits and refreshments that these projects provide for us. If students were to somehow \"design\" these projects, students would obviously take the easy route instead of pushing themselves to become smarter and more vigilant of the criteria that will be taught. For example, various schools and counties require students to read some sort of book and log it over the summer. From experience, we would per say, completely forget about the assignment and log fake dates and pages just for the sake of \"doing it\". Through this path, the student did not learn and influence their reading abilities due to this method. Therefore, validating my thought process. On the other hand, when teachers give a specific book to read, students will most likely read the book or at least read upon a summary to have a little knowledge, knowing that the teacher would give out some kind of quiz or paper to complete. The purpose of requiring a specific book is to provide a reference about how the class will be like and the criteria that will be taught. Student-designed projects would not be reliable in this case.\n \n As a student, memory loss is very frequent in my case. I forget about a handful of material and subjects that have been taught. When given a vocabulary test, I tend to blank and forget about the words that I have studied because it wasn't taught to me over and over again. Memory loss can happen to anyone because it's unpreventable. This is another reason as to why summer projects are designed and assigned. It's to refresh our memory and remind us about the education that has been previously learned. If projects were to be student-designed, they would most likely have absolutely nothing to do with the future subjects. We have no knowledge about what a teacher is going to teach. In this case, wrong statements will be acquired and lead to misconceptions. Our memory would be refreshed with these non-true subjects creating a confused situation once the school year begins.\n \n Not only do teacher-designed projects give students support, but it also gives the teachers support. Teachers can prepare themselves for the upcoming year through summer projects. It can give them some expectation of what to teach. Eventually creating some circumstances that can be built off of. It gives the ability to expand the criteria into something more knowledgeable. For instance, a biology teacher can assign a project that can revolve around cells like eukaryotes and prokaryotes. This project could later on be broken down into units because the project was based on a very broad topic. Because students completed the teacher-designed project, they could possibly be more ready to accomplish learning requirements faster. The knowledge of these students would be broadened leading to an easier understandingÂ of the beginning units.\n \n Unfortunately, teacher-designed summer projects could create stress and anxiety. Summer is a time for children to enjoy no homework, tests and etc. Projects should not be given on a time where students can receive a break. Subsequently, required projects are not going to disappear. Student-designed projects could have less of an influence towards stress because it would most likely be easy to complete and have the possibility of incorporating fun activities. This would achieve the factor of less stress and anxiety of completing a project on time. Although these circumstances appeal greatly to students, teacher-designed projects would believably contain a more beneficial outcome. In the end, a project that has correct information will more likely have a positive outcome in the long run. In conclusion, educators creating these projects will bring upon a better learning experience for students. Teacher-designed projects will prevent students from not learning properly, memory loss and provide teachers an insight about what to teach.",

    essay: "Summer projects, we all hate them but have to do them at some point. There is no getting around it, so why not design them better? Summer projects are becoming more and more common but a lot of students have concerns about their break being over loaded with work. Is it still considered a break when you have to do home work every night for a solid period of time? I think summer projects should be student designed so teachers do not assign too much work, Also its a good use of students time to design and complete a summer project.\n \n I think summer projects should be student designed so teachers do not assign too much work over break. If a project is made by students they will make it as simple as can be while also having all the requirements to still learn the information properly. There should not be anything wrong with having a project with the minimum amount of work needed to still learn the topic. Sometimes teachers create projects without realizing how much work must be done to complete the project. If the project was student created with teacher approval a lot of issues would be solved. Student designed projects that have been approved by a teacher will make the work load go down while the students learn the same information. This is all because the project was designed by someone with relatively the same amount of knowledge of the topic.\n \n In my opinion summer projects should be student designed because its a wise use of time to have students create and then later complete a project. Students will learn a lot when designing a project because they must know what the project is on. Creating a project will teach them the info needed to complete the project so they will learn the information and have it stick in their minds too. The students would be able to complete the work reletivley fast because of the fact that they designed the work themselves. I dont see a problem with getting work done faster do you? Having student designing projects for peers to complete a great use of time because students will learn while creating the project. They will also get the work done quicker since they created the assignment.\n \n An opponent of my view might say that a student created project would be made too easy for the class. A flaw that I can immediately point out in this argument is a teacher would have to approve the student made project before assigning it. A teacher would never approve of a project that didnt make the students actually work. While this opposing viewÂ makes sense there is a way to make sure the work load is appropriate. I think that teachers should have a strict set of guide lines for the project the students are designing.\n \n Summer assignments should be created by students in an effort to make sure students do not work too hard while on summer break. It's also a good use of time for students when they create their ow assignments. The time it takes to completeÂ the work will go down while the amount learned will grow. Summer vacation is a precious time and should not be spoiled by large and work heavy projects. more schools should consider student designed summer projects, its a smart idea. Â Â Â Â",

    essay: "After nine months of endless assignments and fighting the desperate battle to balance academics and extracurriculars, summer break arrives for public schools around the country. Those three months spent relaxing in the sun can be a much needed escape for many, but they can also do a huge disservice, as the knowledge that was previously gathered slowly deteroriates with the sudden loss of daily learning. Schools across America have begun to hand out summer assignments for the classes that are to be taken that fall, and it has ultimately been a success. The question now is how these summer assignments should be created and then presented. I personally believe that these projects and worksheets should be student-designed and for the following reasons: students understand their own time restraints, they know what level of difficulty works for them, and they can see what is and isn't necessary to review.\n \n First is the management of time. The only people who understand what kinds of schedules students follow over the summer are students themselves. Many teachers seem to believe that the summer experienced by high schoolers is similar to those in Disney Channel movies; they wake up at noon and hang out with their friends every day until school starts back up again. The tough truth to accept is that summer has only gotten harder with the passing years. Many students pick up part time jobs to gain income, while others take on their own academic hurdles, such as Generic_School. It can be extraordinarily difficult to find time to lift your head above the flowing current of busywork, which makes it more important that students design these summer assignments. They know how much time to set aside for academic work, and they can think through an effective time management plan which would make assignments not too short and also not too long: moderation.\n \n The second point to examine is the level of difficulty. Students know what kind of work they can handle. From personal experience, it wasn't very fun to sit at the beach and attempt to complete the first page in a packet of AP Chemistry problems, but it was perfectly necessary and extremely helpful. The questions required knowledge from past teachings and a small amount of inference and research, and I completed the assignment in just a few hours. I had to read out of a textbook to understand new concepts, but the work itself was fairly simple. It's these kinds of summer assignments that students would be able to effectively compose, because they do in fact want a healthy challenge, just not an impossible feat. The difficulty levels should vaguely coincide with whatever class the work is preparing students for, without giving them the feeling that they are already back in school.\n \n The last point is knowing what's necessary and what isn't. For example, a long assignment for an optional music class seems rather unnecessary compared to simply suggesting practice over the summer. If students were required to have a lengthy project for every single class that they planned on taking the upcoming school year, summer wouldn't exactly be much different than every other month. Students don't need a complete break, but they also don't need three more months consisting of the same grueling and tasking work. I do think that AP classes should be handing out summer assignments. But academic courses? That's for the teachers to decide.\n \n In conclusion, students are smart enough to form their own summer assignments that follow the basic guidelines given by teachers. They know how to wisely create a project that doesn't absorb too much or too little time, isn't too easy or too hard, and is completely necessary for staying on track in school. Not every student would be willing to work on an idea for a project that would be assigned to each of their classmates, but every grade has several bright and accomplished achievers who would take up the challenge. Students know their own limits. We can set them for ourselves.",

Teachers should designed summer projects because it helps students to learn more on what they need to do and students know what they need to be doing without stressing about it; however if students designed projects it could be wrong.\n \n First, teachers should designed summer projects because it help students on what they need to do. For example, it helps students to get to the level where they have to be for the next school year and students actually understand the subjects better. Students actually get the work done because they are doing. Teachers should designed summer projects because it helps students get ready and prepare. students should do what their teachers asks them to do so that they can get better and prepare.\n \n Second, students know what they need to be doing without stressing about it.

    essay: "Many schools require students to complete summer projects in order to keep them learning over the break. These projects are usually teacher-designed and are assigned to the students at the end of the year. Some students argue that these projects should be student-designed rather than teacher-designed since it is taking up their summer fun time, but many disagree. Summer projects should continue to be teacher-designed because students will receive a premade rubric, projects are likely to be more organized, and projects can still be based off the students liking.\n \n Some will argue that summer projects should be student-designed due to the fact that it is taking place during the students summer free time. Students want to be able to create the project themselves so then they can create it how they want to create it but that makes grading very difficult for teachers. Letting students design summer projects also has a high risk of unorganitzation because students may have the mentality that they can do whatever they want and still receive a good grade. If students do what their teachers tell them to do, then they will already know what to do from the beginning.\n \n Most teachers and parents would agree that a rubric should be given to the students for them to follow while completing projects. Rubrics allow students to have a guideline to follow while completing their projects, essentially making the projects easier. Rubrics also give students a checklist that helps them stay on track and makes sure they are getting everything done that they need to get done in order to get a good grade. If students created their own rubrics, that would make grading projects extremely difficult for the teachers and most students do not understand how hard it is to actually create a rubric. Therefor, rubrics should always be given out by the teachers.\n \n If summer projects continue to be teacher-designed, then students are more likely to be more organized with their project. Students will have gotten an explanation on how to complete their project and will have been informed in a way everyone understands on how to complete the project to the best of their abilities. Organization is key when completing projects and the best way to stay organized is to allow the teachers send students on the right track. Most students to not think about how easy it is to become unorganized and turn a great project into a ball of confusion. They need the teachers help to make sure they do the project right.\n \n Summer projects may be teacher-designed but that does not mean they can not be based off of the students opinions and liking. Students can still receive a rubric and be told what to do and still have a high level of creativity involved in their project. Before school comes to an end, teachers can ask the students what they want to do most. having that information allows teachers to create a project that is easy for them to grade and is still fun and enjoyable for the students who are doing the project. A big factor in school projects is making something that the students can be happy and proud of and not something that they forced themselves to finish and are unhappy with. In order to keep both teachers and students happy, summer projects should continue to be teacher-designed.\n \n Once summer starts, students become independent and are on their own with the project they are assigned with. That is why they should be given a guideline on how to complete their project, ways to stay organized, but they should still be able to complete their project with a smile on their faces. If summer projects stay teacher-based, then all three points can be addressed and improved upon. Students may believe that they can do everything by themselves but they will never succeed without a teachers help from the beginning.",

    essay: "Students tend to forget the curricular over the long period of not being at school. I would understand because my middle school required everyone to be assign on either projects/assignments over summer, to assure our learning. Having the teacher design the summer project is better then having students design them for many reasons. Teachers know what to put into the summer project and know that the students would use their knowledge to complete the assignment.\n \n Teachers have the ability to acquire the knowledge that they teach to their students and assign the projects to the students' understanding. I have done a summer project in middle school just so I would not forget my studies. Plus, to maintain their knowledge it would have been school related, in order to continue their learning process. It would make the student feel at ease when coming back to school.\n \n Students would have forgotten the subjects over the summer break by the time they start school again. Knowing that they would, requiring them to complete a summer project is appropriate. From my experience, I know that in math they start to review a little of the course that I took last year to prepare me for the math that I would take this year. To be ready for the next curricular, students need to review themselves over break to know the basic understanding of what the other subject is going to build off on. Which is the reason on having the teachers to create the project base on the subjects that they learned throughout the course.\n \n Although having to work on a project over summer can be a positive outcome, there are negative outcome with it. The project that the teachers would make, can be boring and students do not want to have a summer project to ruin their summer break. I would have given up and procrastinate whenever there is a project assign to me over break. If the student design the project it would not very educational, they would not know what to do on the project. Having a teacher-designed project is important to their education and to the school. Their lack of understanding of creating a summer project that has to be important to their electives and their learning.\n \n In conclusion, having the teacher to design a summer project is purely out of knowledge within the curricular that they teach to the students themselves. Keeping up with the students' education is important to boast their confidence to the next subject. The students would understand the requirement of their project if the teacher created the project instead of the students. Acquiring the course throughout the summer break would help with their next subject and obtaining a recall on the course.Â  Â Â Â",

    essay: "The final bell rings as students come flying out the school doors pushing and shoving each other to be the first one on their bus, school is out and the halls are left empty, just when people start to relax at home they remember about the summer project that has to be finished by the time school is back in session. school projects can be a pain, but they do serve a purpose. Teachers require students to complete this summer project to assureÂ they dont loose the knowledge they learned throughout the year and to also assure they continue to learn throughout their break. Summer projects should be student-designed because it gives the student freedom, shows the knowledge of the student, and lets the project vary from student to student.\n \n Summer projects can give students the freedom to do whatever they see fit and show how they can be creative. Students like to have freedom and will put more effort into something where they can choose what to do rather than have the same project assigned to everyone where creativeness is not a product. Students have to complete the work assigned to them in school which is already lacking creativity, teachers should give the students freedom in this summer project and have the student leave the school with a positive outlook. Every day student complain about the lack of freedom school already has, leaving them to be tempted by the things they cannot have.\n \n Schools want to know that the students are keeping their minds fresh with knowledge and over the summer they give them a project to be completed by the time they come back. Having these projects be student-designed can not only be creative but also show what the student knows and remembers. Students can present what they know and how much they continued to learn by the projects they choose to do. The summer projects can also tell a teacher what topic they need to work more on with the students, and is very helpful in doing so.\n \n Students can choose what they want to show and how they want to show it, whether if it is an essay, interview, or a project that have to build, with the ideas being limitless one students project cannot be the same as another, with each project having a unique difference. students can fallow their own rules and go the places their mind takes them. With the projects being different and varying,coming in all shapes and forms, the student can choose what they want to do and what they are be able to do. With the projects being different it can be easier to tell if a student copied anotherÂ students work, where as if all the projects were kept the same it can not be easy to tell if someone copied another work.\n \n Some teacher may argue and say that a teacher-designed project may be better, but a student-designed project can outbalance the good in a teacher-designed project. Rather that telling us what we need to Know students should be able to show just how much they actually know, some student can look up the information then forgetÂ about it because it is something that they are being graded for and have to include it inÂ the project to get the best grade they can achieve. This also helps prepare the student for next year by showing them what they need to work more on and better themselves so the can enter the next year without any problems.\n \n In conclusion schools and teachers should let students design their own summer projects because it gives more freedom to the student, gives teachers a sense of the students knowledge, and gives the project variation. The final bell rings as all the students are let out, but one thing remains hanging over their shoulders, a summer project. Â",

    essay: "Statistics show that when teachers help students one on one they are more likely to recieve better standards on school work then when teachers do not work with students. Many people believe that summer projects are un-necessary because students work all school year and now it's their summer break. Although, in reality, summer projects help keep students in a working mindset and helps them stay dedicated to school. Summer projects should be designed by the teachers themselves because this gives the students insight on the teacher's style of instructing, it maintains equal opportunities to all students, it keeps the structure of a standardized school project.\n \n To begin with, as a student, being familiar with the teaching style of your instructors is a very necessary component to doing well in certain classes. All teachers have a differnet style of teaching; depending on the way they feel comfortable conducting their lessons. However, not all students may be able to adapt to the style of a specific teacher. By assigning a teacher-designed summer assignment, this gives students the opportunity to take a quick glance at the way specific teachers conduct their lessons. This allows students to not only be ahead but also prepared at the start of the school year, knowing how their instructor assigns work.\n \n Furthermore, teacher-designed summer assignments maintain an equal opportunity to all students. This means, all students will be assigned the same project by the same teachers. Sometimes when students work together they may not be able to completely agree, meaning when they create a summer assignment; some students may not like the project and its format. However, if the assignment is created by the teachers themselves, it means the students can't question eachother, but only rely on the teachers abilities.\n \n Additionally, throughout the school year teachers will assign projects to students using not only school-wide but their own standards. If the summer projects assigned to students were created by the teachers themselves, the project will maintain this standard implemented by both the school board and staff. Unlike students, teachers have plenty of experience when it comes to educating young adults. Due to the experince teachers have in their field of study, they can create a better, more structured assignment using their personal views and insights on the subject. Many people may say that if the project was student-designed then the students could relate to the project more or the project would be more understandable. However, the students may accidentally cut corners when creating the project anf be held accountable. When teachers design the summer assignment, it maintains a well-rounded format and is also related to the lessons throughout the acedmic year.\n \n In conclusion, summer projects keep students in a working mindset and helps them stay dedicated to school. Projects that are created and assigned by the teachers are more reliable knowing the assignment has a standardized structure and will contain all the details in conducting the project. Allthough students may want to create a project they can easily complete due to the fact they created it, the project may not have all of the details it needs and will not contain the format implemented by the staff themselves.Â",

The question is should the students' projects be teacher- designed or student- designed? I believe summer projects should be teacher- designed. Teacher- designed projects are entirely beneficial than student- designed projects because students prepare themselves for college, it takes them less time to complete the projectÂ and help students develop many other skills needed in life.\n \n First, students are able to prepare for college with a teacher- designed project, by helping them get used to a criteria that comes with a project. Often time in college students are given certain requirements needed to get a passing score. For example, a student may have to write a 10 page report in MLA format when they attend college if they are not used to completing strict projects, they may not complete the courses needed in college. That is why it is imperative if students start now than to be left behind later.\n \n Second, summer projects should be straight to the point and shouldn't last an extended amount of time to complete.\n \n If students hit the basic points and objectives of a project than they will learn more about the specific subject and they will excel passed the standard qualifications of the project. If there is less time wasted on guessing what the teacher would like to see, than that gives students more time to enjoy their summer.\n \n Lastly, teacher- designed projects may help students excel in life. Teacher- designed projects are developed to encourage students in many different ways. For example, if the teacher assigns a report; that will help a student with word documents. Also, if a teacher assigns a speech as a project it will help students with their public speaking. Teachers help prepare students for their future and everything they will need in life.\n \n In conclusion, teacher- designed projects help students in many ways possible. They will be able to experience a taste of college, take less time with their project and help students in the long run . Some may say that summer projects should be student- based to encourage their minds of creativity and uniqueness, however without the guidence from a teacher students may not understand the importance of structured classwork .

    essay: "Summer projects are frowned upon by many students across the U.S, but why are they even assigned in the first place? They provide us with material to review and they also give us the opportunity to get something under our belt that we may have had complications with during the school year. Lately, an astounding amount of students believe that these project should be 'student designed' instead of ' teacher designed'. this means that these projects that help students review certain materials before the schools year start would be designed by the students and not the teacher. 'Teacher-designed' projects allow the students to review past material and to work on skills/subjects that they were struggling with.\n \n Teachers design these projects so their students can study all of the material, not just the the things that were simple and easy to complete. Having the students work on material that was taught during the year allows them to keep the information in their heads, so they won't forget things such as: how to solve for x when 2x+4=0 or what a fault line is. Every student willÂ have the material in their heads so when they come back to school they wont be struggling to pass.\n \n 'Teacher-designed' projects also allows students that are struggling with a certain piece of material to review it, work on it, and try to learn said piece. Every student across the Earth has at least one or two things that they struggle with during the year. Having teachers design the summer projects allows them to add in those specific points, so the students that are having trouble will have a chance to work on it. This also allows them to not have to struggle to pass in the up coming school year, if they do happen to take advantage of it.\n \n Students believe that they will be given too much work to complete resulting in them not being able to enjoy their summer. Now, if they would work on the project little by little everyday or every other day then they would get the assignment completed that way the could enjoy their summer without a care in the world. Most students decide to do the work last minute causing them to be stressed and get a low grade, due to the fact that they were rushing to get it completed by a certain time. they also believe if that if the students designed to project they could get it done quickly by only dded material that they know and that they are comfortable with, but what are they really getting out if it? Maybe. their whole summer to goof off and a decent grade when they go back to school? they wont the same opportunity of reviewing material if it was like this. causing them to struggle and possibly fail.\n \n Students mainly focus on getting the project done instead of focusing on what they need to learn or know by the fall. Teachers dont give us work to be mean, they give us this work because they want us to pass and so we have to correct material to move on in our young adult lives. Projects give us the chance toÂ show what we know and give us a chance to go over the things we know and what we should know.",

    essay: "Some Schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Projects are used to enhance learning in a different way. During the summer no student wants to work on school work or even think about school. I think that summer projects should be teacher- designed because students may take a while to come up with a project or idea, teacher- designed projects are already made and ready to go, Projects would be less confusing when made by the teacher themselves.\n \n One reason I think that summer projects should be teacher-designed is because students may take a while to come up with ideas for the project or put it off. Students are in school at least 8 to 9 months or for some students all year around, so when it comes to summer break students are ready to relax, go on vacation, or just sleep. Students already have done tons of projects for classes or even just for one class and those projects are very stressful for some. Summer in a lot of cases are relax time and forget about school time so when they are given a project to do a lot would just put it to the side and dont do it at all. When coming up with ideas on what to do some will not know or just not even try that's why it think it should be teacher-base.\n \n Another reason that summer projects should be teacher-based is that teacher-based projects are already made in advance and are ready to go during summer and all the students have to do is follow the instructions of the project itself. If students are given the instructions and already know the idea it makes it a little easier to get done over the summer. Students tend to procrastinate and take their time, which they should, but that time may be at the last minute. It could be August and they have to go back to school that following week and haven't even came up with an idea yet. Teacher-based projects already have the idea and the instructions on how to do it and it saves time depending on the project. Students can still not do it at all but at least they have the foundation on what to do and start it and have it done with in weeks or days.\n \n Furthermore, Teacher- based projects may be less confusing then when a student comes up with it from the top of their head. Students already dont want to do the project in the first place so the idea may be very confusing to other students or the teacher. If the project is a group project the idea may not be understood fully and may get taking the wrong way. Students school brains are already shut down so when to making ideas students tend to wing it and just throw it out especially when it is a group project. They think that the other is just going to figure it out on their own and that may not be the case or they leave each other hanging. Teacher- based projects make it easier because the idea and instructions are already there and all the students have to do is just follow them.\n \n However, Teacher-based projects do have a downside to them. Teachers, of course, have been teaching and assigning projects all year and some are easy and some are not. Projects that are given by the teacher have to be completed by the instructions given and if it is not completed that way or in that way all that hard work just went down the drain. Student- based project do make it easier because it is their idea, their instructions, and their own way. So all that hard work doesn't have to go the drain for nothing. Student-based projects can be more creative because it is made from scratch and from their own head. Teacher-based projects are usually less creative because students are just trying to finish it and get it over with. In contrast, students may take a lot of time or wait till the last minute.\n \n In conclusion, Teacher- based projects or student based projects can all be very good projects. Summer projects can be challenging because the summer is relaxing time, even though all of adults think otherwise, but summer projects do keep the brain fresh. I think that summer projects should be teacher based because it makes it easier on them and the students.Â",

    essay: "When you think of summer projects do you think of fun,active,joyfull times and eciting learning? When you think of a teacher asigning a summer project you don't think of it being eciting. You think of restricted activies,rules,and limmited time. These characteristics might even take away from a student wanting to do summer projects. This is why I stongly agree that students should design the summer project because they have the right to do what they enjoy and not feel they are limited to their ideas.\n \n Students don't want to be stress all summer about a project their teacher assigned them. They should be granted to do what they want on their summer break. By allowing students to do their own summer projects lets them do what they enjoy the most. This makes it easier for them to complete and not be stressed out. This could let them have a great score coming back from summer break.\n \n Having a summer project and letting students create it lets them think of many ideas. This lets them not feel limited of what they can or can't do. For eample everything around us involves math student could group up and measure who can throw a football the longest distince. Letting students create a project for themselfs can boost their creativity and learn difrerent things around them. In this generation kids just want to stay inside on the phone this lets them get out and think of wounderful new things.\n \n Some people may disagre the statement of letting students creating thier own summer project. This could lead to students being foucsed too much on having fun than learning and completing the project. Students may not have hte experence of doing projects and leaving them stressed and confused. Students may not feel its nesecaery do to when its not assigned by a teacher. Which means student will fail and start off their upcoming year failing classes.\n \n Summer projects should make you think of an easy and fun thing to do. If you had a project to do how would you would want enjoyable By allowing student to create their own gives them the chance to know what they are capable of imaging. Also letting student not think projects are not just about thinking too hard but allowing them to create a project from what they love doing. Even though others not with students creating their own project. If you had a project to do how would you would want enjoyable?",

    essay: "Every year when summer break rolls around, students become restless and excited. But as soon as they get comfortable and begin to relax and enjoy the stress-free summer life, the realization that they have school projects to do hits them like a ton of bricks, oftentimes draining the enjoyment from their time on break. Many school teachers find it easiest and most convenient to design a project and assign it to the students, but this just ends up turning into a chore for students. What if, to lessen the students' feelings of resentment towards summer projects, the teachers allowed the projects to be student-designed? Although some believe that required summer projects should be teacher-designed, in reality it is much more beneficial to the student for the projects to be student-designed.\n \n Required summer projects should be student-designed because when students are in control of their project, they are able to express themselves and an interest they may have through the assignment. Teachers, when designing the project they assign, may feel that by providing parameters and a rubric for an assignment they are helping the student out. In reality, they are just limiting the student to think in the way the teacher thinks. On the other hand, when students design the project, they are better able to express a passion they would like to share with others. For example, a project that requires the student to read a book and do a report on the character symbolism simply becomes a chore in the eyes of the student. This student may have a passion for nature and animals, yet there would be no way for them to express that passion within the confinement of a literary analysis project. If the student were able to design the project by his or herself, it would immediately become less of a chore as they would have the freedom to do the project on something they love, be it nature, music, art, athletics, science, or any other topic of their choice. It is almost guaranteed that a student will put more effort into a project regarding a topic they are interested in. When students have a say in their assignment, it no longer feels like a pointless task forced upon them by a superior; thus, the quality of the project will likely be higher as they will feel motivated when the assignment allows them to express themselves.\n \n When students design their own projects, they develop independence that shapes them as an individual and prepares them for later in life. By telling their students exactly what to do for a summer project, teachers may be making it easier for the student in the short term. In the long term however, they are restricting the student's independence and individuality by not allowing them to make their own mature choices in designing their own project. When a student is allowed to design their own project, they are making small choices that teach them how to think and make choices independently and creatively without constant oversight. As well as training the student to make their own decisions, designing a project teaches individuals to have confidence. This is a much needed trait for teenagers nowadays who often times lack the self-confidence needed to pursue something they have a passion for. It is beneficial to society to instill self-confidence, individuality, and independence in students so that they are able to pursue their passions in life. These traits that can arise from something as simple as designing one's own project prepare individuals for life in the real world to be productive citizens that can make a difference in the world.\n \n Something as simple as a required summer project can have lasting effects on students if they are allowed to design it themselves and are not confined by the boundaries instilled by their teacher. When a student is able to design the project them self, they are able to express passions they may otherwise have no way to express and will likely create a higher quality project because of their interest in a topic. Also, designing the project by one-self instills confidence, independence, and individuality which are valuable traits today in teenagers transitioning to adulthood. Although some believe that required summer projects should be teacher-designed, the benefits that result from allowing the project to be student-designed can potentially shape an individual to be ready to go out into the real world and make a difference.Â",

    essay: "Summer can either be the best time of the year or the worst. With a mixture of the heat, mosquitoes, and stress about the new comingÂ school year, summer has its troubles. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to show learning is being done outside of school. The debate occurs with deciding if the projects should be student or teacher designed. Summer projects should be student-designed because it allows for creativity, one learns time management, and one can exercise self-reliance.\n \n One reason why summer projects should be student-designed is that it allows for creativity. Without strict guidelines, students can produce original content. This will make grading better for teachers because they see a variety of projects. Creativity is important to a student because it will make the project more interesting. Students like to make a project their own and will overall put in a substantialÂ amount of effort when they can be creative. One can easily see how student-designed projects allow for creativity.\n \n Another reason why summer projects should be student-designed is that one learns time management. A student learns time management because they have a set period of time to create their projects. Students will have the ability to manage when they start their projects and can decide when the time is best for them. When students learn time management it helps them prepare for life outside of school as well as build character. It can be concluded that student-designed projects allow one to learn time management.\n \n The final reason why summer projects should be student-designed is that one can exercise self reliance. When a student creates their own project, they rely fully on themselves. Self-reliance is a skill that can only be gained by practicing. This is a great skill to have because one will need it in the future. It is beneficial to start learning how to be self reliant as soon as possible. While creating summer projects, one can clearly see that students gain the important life skill of self-reliance.\n \n Some people may think summer projects should be teacher-designed because it prevents confusion, but if students have questions they can easily email their teacher. Because one can be creative, learns time management, and exercises self-reliance, summer projects should be student-designed. The next time you meet with a school teacher, talk to them about how important it is to get students involved in creating their own projects. Without student-designed projects, students would be miserable and hate their summer. Make a change in the community around you for the better, and improve students lives for generations.Â",

Since students usually understand what each other enjoy about projects they can rule out the difficulties of planning and have fun doing the project while balancing work with enjoyment. This allows Students to do the project with enthusiasm instead of being bored and miserable from getting a project topic they never wanted and without executing it in a way that would add their uniqueness to it.\n \n Summer Projects should be put in the hands of students because if they are the ones doing the projects why not give them the responsibility of running the projects and have them be done how they want to make the summer more enjoyable.",

    essay: "Just because it is summer break does not mean kids should stop learning. Some schools have required summer projects to ensure this learning continues. One issue they have come across when doing this is should these projects be student or teacher-designed? Summer projects should be student-designed because some students have limited time, allowing them to design it will create more motivation to do it, and it is their time off to relax.\n \n Summer may be a break from school but this does not mean that all students have completely unlimited time.\n \n Many students hold a job over the summer in order to save or just get money. Allowing for student-design enables students to ensure that they have the ability to complete the project even if they are working. Finding a work and school life balance can be hard, but allowing students to have a little control can help ensure that they can find that balance. Summer is the time of the year where many people go on vacation. Students going on vacation should be able to enjoy family or friend time without stressing over the project. Student-design is going to help them know that they can complete the project without hassle or worry. Having projects be student-designed helps students with limited time manage the learning alongside their work or vacation time.\n \n Motivation makes the task at hand a lot easier compared to when someone is unmotivated. Motivation is a big factor when it comes to a workload. If projects are student designed this will create motivation for them to complete it. Having the projects fit what the students want is helpful in making sure the project is reaching completion. Designing their own projects in comparison to the teachers designing it helps ensure that the student is actually interested in it and will truly learn from the experience. Learning is a daily part of everyones life. Students having a choice in a school system where almost everything is designed for them by someone else is a welcome change. Having this choice of what the project should be is going to increase motivation greatly.\n \n Summer is a time of relaxation. Summer break is specifically for students and faculty to have time off from the stressful school year. Students should be able to relax since they have worked so hard the whole year. Designing their own projects is a way to enable them to be stress-free due to them choosing the concept of the project. Stress plays a big role in an individuals happiness. Having time to de-stress is hugely important for anyone, not just students. Choosing what they want their project to be is going to create a more relaxing summer for students so they feel they can reach completion. Having time off is very important for students.\n \n When it comes to summer projects student-design is the way to go. Allowing students to create their projects will make life a lot easier for the students while still ensuring they receive some sort of education while on summer break. In conclusion, the summer projects should be student designed because some students have limited time due to work or vacation, giving them the creative freedom to design it is going to help with motivation, and last but not least it is their much needed time to relax.",

    essay: "Over the summer, many teachers assign projects that are due the first day back to school. Usually, they are teacher-designed and all students must complete them the way the teacher would like them to be completed. What if the teacher decided to allow students to create their own assignment to be turned in the first day of school? Many students would love for that to happen because then they can make the assignment as simple and easy as possible because that would mean less work for the student over the summer. Personally, the teacher-designed assignments are better than a student-designed assignment for many reasons. This will assure the student has a structure to go on that is the same for all students, this also assures that every student has the same assignment and it would be up to them to make it their own and be creative. Also, if a student had a self-designed assignment the chances of actually getting good work are very small because no student, or teacher, wants to do work over the summer.\n \n Assuring the student has a good structure to go on for the assignment is a strong key point in having a teacher-designed assignment. When the teacher assigns the work over the summer they obviously give each student the same assignment which means there is a structure behind the work. If a student designed their own guidelines then each student could come up with something different but sometimes they may be too different and it may be harder for a student to understand an assignment that way. Personally, a teacher-designed assignment is more beneficial because then the teacher gives you the criteria needed and it is up to the student to complete the work correctly and we can also be creative as long as we are inside the lines of what the teacher actually wants. This somewhat teaches students structure and discipline in a way because when a teacher asks for something done a certain way we, as students, are expected to do it that way and it is kind of like a job. At a real world job if your boss gives you a work project you do it, that is the same dynamic as a student and a teacher.\n \n With a teacher-designed assignment this makes sure all students have the same criteria, what the students do for the assignment from that point on is on them. Everyone can have the same assignment but can be as creative as they would like to be. Typically a student would want to design their own assignment for the creativity factor of it all but little do they realize even if a teacher gives them strict guidelines there are different ways to carry out an assignment in your own way but still reaching what the teacher asks for. The point of a teacher-designed assignment is to give the students all the same thing or at least give the students all the same options on what they can do. With or without the options, the student should still be completing what the teacher asks them to. School is so much like the real world, job wise. When the boss gives their workers an assignment those workers better do it and do it right or they won't be in very good standings. The same goes for when a teacher gives the student an assignment, either the student will do it to their best abilities or they will have to suffer with the bad grade as a punishment.\n \n Finally, if the teacher allowed the students to create their own assignments there's no telling what kids will bring in. Nobody, not even teachers, want to work over the summer. With that being said, without a good bases for an assignment kids will easily do the most minimum amount of work possible. Which then leads to a terrible grade and little to no foundation. Being a student takes a lot of responsibility and discipline, a teacher-designed assignment teaches a lotÂ of the responsibility and discipline simply by meaning if it's not done the student will pay for not doing it. Having a student-designed assignment doesn't always teach really good discipline because the child can do what they want to a degree without having to really show their fullest potential.\n \n In conclusion, a teacher designed assignment is far better than a student-designed one. The reasons above aren't even close to all of the possible reasoning for my answer, the biggest reasoning is based on teaching responsibility. A student has to maintain responsibility in order to be a good student and doing a summer project correctly based on how the teacher assigned it, shows how responsible and dedicated that student is compared to others who choose not to do the assignment.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

    essay: "Summer can be a time for students to have fun and enjoy the wonders of the world, however summer does not mean one can take a break from learning. Every summer, students are required by theirÂ schools to complete a project during their break to assure students continue to learn. Summer projects are generally teacher-designed and based off a strict outline, which can limit the students creativity. Summer projects should be student-designed because it will motivate students to expand their learning, engage their creativity, and it will create a sense of accomplishment in the alumni, which will set them up for success.\n \n Every year more and more students fail to complete their summer projects. One might think that they are not being completed because students do not care enough to compile to what is being asked of them. In reality students do not complete their summer projects because there is a lack of interest between the student and the theme of the project. Students should be able to design their own projects as it can motivate them to expand their knowledge while on summer vacation. Typically teacher-designed projects are based off of a strict format where a student is given a topic to research and write about. Although, many may say that having projects formatted this way will set up students for the future, they fail to realize the damage that is being done to a students interest in learning. When a student is forced to research a topic that is not of interest to them they tend to only provide what is needed of them. They do not attempt to further learn about the topic more than are required to because the goal in mind is: what is the quickest way I can get this done? However, when one allows a student to decide what they would like to create a project on one can see the excitement radiate off of their face. The student becomes motivated to start designing their project because it will be based on a topic they are passionateÂ about.\n \n In addition to, motivating students to expand their learning horizons, allowing students to create their own projects instead of having teacher-designed projects will allow students to engage their creative side. As said before, many teacher-designed projects have a cemented format in which they prefer their student's project's to be formatted in leaving little to any space for student creativity. By giving the student an all accesses pass to creating their own student-designed project, it allows for students to think out side the box. For instance, instead of the alumni creating a PowerPoint with several slides of repeating information, the student could design their project through a form of art. Take for example, a student who is doing a project on how pollution affects the oceans;He or she could paint a picture to further depict and attract the audiences attention to the topic being discussed. The student would also benefit tremendously through the ability of using their creativity as It has been scientifically proven that people who use their creativity are most likely to excel academically. Each and every student is smart however, at times students are unable to demonstrate this as a result of teacher-designed summer projects.\n \n Lastly, think about a time in which you have had to work extremely to accomplish a goal and you reached it. Do you remember the pure excitement you felt as you looked back at your painstakingly hard work and realized that it was all worth it? That is the exact feeling students will feel after completing their summer projects. Students should be allowed to design their own projects as it will give students a sense of accomplishment. when the student realizes what they can do if they are determined, the student will then be furthermore motivated to do well in school and in other aspects of their life. For example, in cartoons, when a character is faced with an obstacle, trains to overcome the obstacle, and overcomes it ;it plants a seed of self confidenceÂ that will only flourish as time goes by. Like that seed the student will flourish into a responsible and academicallyÂ smart student.\n \n Students have been completing teacher-designed projects for too long and it is now time for a change by allowing students to design their own summer projects to motivate them to expand their knowledge, creativity, and to set them up for success. As a result of permitting students to do this, every student will develop a loveÂ for the free education that is provided to them. Are you willing to give students this opportunity?

    essay: "Students often complain about having homework, regardless of what time of year it is. Summer break is usually a time for students to relax without the fear of having to do any school work. They do not know that in the long run, having take home projects will be beneficial to their school, and life, careers. Through doing summer projects, students receive more learning opportunities and help create a sense of organization and time management. Students who collaborate with teachers on putting together these projects will help them be more willing and enthusiastic about doing them over their summer break.\n \n Summer projects give students an open opportunity to learn new things before starting a new year of school. Researching and putting together a project of all the information one has learned is a great way to gain more knowledge that may be crucial for their next year of classes. Eigth grade year, before school ended, our teacher told us there would be a summer project that our whole grade had to complete before we entered ninth grade. All of us were not enthusiastic about this information, we did a lot of complaining. Our teacher then told us that we would, as a group, decide on a project. Many options were presented to us. Projects on the Roman Empire, Hinduism, Greek Mythology, and even the Egyptian Empire were all options for us to choose from. After many minutes of arguing and ruling out options one by one, the class came to the decision of Greek mythology. It was required that we work in groups and collaborate on the project. Over the summer, my group would have meet up's and Skype sessions to find ways to make our project more interesting. I enjoyed this project more than I thought I would. Mythology was very interesting and it gave me something to do over our long break. Also, It helped me with the first unit of our world studies class, which was based upon the Greek Gods, Godesses, and tales of ancient greece. By deciding as a class, we ultimately chose a project that we all enjoyed to do, and it gave us an advantage to have already known things by the time we reached ninth grade.\n \n Organization and time management are two skills that highschoolers and adults find beneficial to have when it comes to doing any type of work. Our summer project on mythology was time consuming, but our group knew it had to be done. At the beginning of summer, the group I was in decided that every week, on Wednesday night, we would either meet up or video chat to work on and research our project for at least an hour and a half. This helped us manage our time and priorities with other things we had to do in life. We spent the first half of our Wednesday nights researching many of the tales of ancient Greece and the Gods and Godesses associated with them. Our second half of Wednesday's was dedicated to putting together our creative elements of our project. We assigned eachother different mini projects to do, and worked together on creating a large tri-fold poster dedicated to the basic facts of our project. By creating this plan, we managed to get our project done with two weeks left before school would start. It taught me to be deligent in my work and how to be organized while also working with other people.\n \n Some students, and even teachers may argue that summer break is meant for the students to enjoy their time off and relax without worry and stress of homework. I think that while homework and projects may be stressful, If it is something I somewhat enjoy, it will help me push through the work and gain knowledge that I may need in the future. Students will not always have summer break, and after their education, we will have to spend almost everyday working. It is good to get into the habit of starting and finishing tasks on time, because in the future, many of us will need the skills and characteristics to succeed in our jobs and careers.\n \n Students who decide and do summer projects will be presented with chalenges, but being able to gain knowledge and have fun while doing it will always be a good idea. To teach students how to manage their time and priorities will help them in future situations and create a long lasting affect on the way they go about working on projects and turning on their best work on time.",

The smallest things can help students continue their education during break. This task can be made possible if students could design their own projectsÂ rather than relying on the teachers. The summer projects should not be teacher-designed because instructors control class and projects during the school year. One project that is student-designed will give the students a turn to control the expectations and rubric. If students could manage and design their own projects, it would give them an opportunity to create something that expresses their interests while enjoying their summer break.\n \n When students are let out of school for summer break they are looking forward to the time off from school. The warm weather makes it fun to hang out with friends outdoors and go swimming. But if teachers were create and design a project for students to complete then that would be taking the fun out of summer break. It would be a hassle for students to be required to complete a teacher-designed project rather than the students designing the requirements and topic for the project. If the students have to take time out their summer to complete a project then it should designed by them. During the entire school year students are required to complete assignments at their instructors expense. Students are in school for more than half of the year, it is important that they can enjoy their lengthy summer break without being controlled by their teachers. If the students are required to complete a project during their summer break then it should be designed by the students. Summer break is meant to give students time to relax from stressful, hefty homework. It would be unfair to students if they were required to complete a project that was teacher-designed due to the importance for students to experience a stress-free break rather than worrying about due dates for assignments and tests.\n \n Summer work is no fun for any student. It will be hard to convince any student to continue their education during their summer break because summer is all about no homework or projects. A way around that issue is giving the students a chance to complete the project at their own pace and interest. Any summer projects or assignments for students should be based around their interest rather than teachers interest. During the summer students will be busy having fun with friends, going on vacation or enjoying their time off from school. If a teacher assigns students an assignment or project that is not appealing, the chances of the students putting 100% effort into the project is slim. Also, the chances of students actually completing a teacher-based project efficientlyÂ is slim as well. But, if it was a student-designed project, the completion rate would skyrocket due to the fact the students would actually want to do the summer work. It will be hard for students to motivate and push themselves to complete a project if it is boring. Teacher-design summer work would be unfair to students that would like to control their education and topic. Projects and assignments based on the students interest would exemplifyÂ better work ethic and dedication. It is important for students to continue learning during the summer, but it should be learning based on their interests and goalsÂ rather than any teacher.\n \n It would not be a good decision to let students design and control their own summer projects or assignments because it is important students are learning the correct material necessary for class. It would be pointless for students to complete a summer assignment or project if it was not based on the school's curriculum. A teacher-designed project would be more beneficial for the students than allowing the students to design their own project, The instructors are aware of the things the students will be required to learn during the school year. If the teachers would be allowed to control the summer work then it would give the students a head startÂ on the upcoming material in their classes. Overall, the teacher's should control the requirements and rubric for the summer work because the students would learn things that are related to school rather than researching things that are irrelevant to anything they would be exposed to during the school year.\n \n Moreover, students should be given the freedom to choose any topic for their summer work rather than letting the teachers design the projects. Summer is about free time and preparing for the next school year to come. But, if students had to worry and stress about a difficult, teacher-deigned project then it would be sucking the fun out of summer break. It would be unfair for teachers to require students to complete an assignment based on the instructors expectations. It would be easier for students to show their hobbies and interests through a project that they would enjoy rather than letting the instructor choose.Â",

    essay: "Some schools require sudents to complete summer projects to assure that they continued learning during their break. In order for the school to know weather their students learned over their break, their summer projects must be teacher designed.\n \n When it comes to projects that are required by the school, the projects should have high standards; which means they should be teacher-designed. Teachers put a lot of thought into their students assignments, they think about things that the student may learn in the process of doing their work. They are the ones who teach and push students to their limit so that they can benefit from it in the long run. If the projects were to be student-designed, the students will not put the same amount of effort in their work. They will not put the same amount of thought, instead they will take the easy way out which does not benefit the student intelectually. Now the easy way out for a student would be making the projects topic on something they already know by heart. This would lead the school into thinking that their student's learned something new during the summer.\n \n In order for a student to learn over their break, they will need something a bit challenging. Something that will exercise their mind and lead them into puting more thought into their project. Usually when teachers assign projects, they give their students a rubric explaining what they expect from their work. Rubrics have standards, it gives students an idea of how their project may be great or awful. Some students may look at it and think about how they want it to be a succesful project, others will look and think about how they can improve their work. By teachers using this method they can see who really worked hard on their projects. Another way of knowing if the student's have learned would be by teachers assigning every student an individual topic. None of the students would be able to copy off of eachother for answers, they would have to find their own information.\n \n Another way that the school would be able to assure that their students learned over break would be by a report made by a teacher. Teachers can now use certain apps to see if their students have logged in and completed a certain part of the summer project. Some teachers may assign students relieable website's recommended by the county or state in order for students to use over the summer so that they can exercise their minds. When using the site's the students would have to use specific log in account's that would connect to the teachers account. That would let the teacher see if they have been using it and if they are struggling in certian subjects in the class. Plus all the data would be recorded and could easily be sent to the school so that they can see in better depth of what their students are learning. This would be a great way to make sure that the students are learning over their break.\n \n The only way for the school to know if the students are learning and completing their summer projects would have to be with teacher-designed projects. Teachers truley care about their students and want them to do the best that they can. Whenever students get the liberty of doing something on their own, they often cheat or end up doing anything and calling it work. But with putting standards in, it changes the entire way the student thinks and how they process everything because of the requirments they must meet. By pushing students that extra mile the school will be able to tell if they have learned once break is over and they will see improvements in their work by the time they come back from break.

    essay: "Most schools require some kind of work for students to do over the course of the summer outside of school. Usually, these assignments are to keep topics fresh in the minds of the students so that they can retain the information for the coming school year. These assignments do refresh the student on the topics that they have learned; however, the students rarely apply themselves to these assignments. Students do not see a point to these assignments because they don't think of the long term benefits of these assignments as the cause for their success in school. I think that these summer assignments should be designed by teachers so that they cover the necessary topics, but take into account the students requests as well. These summer assignments designed by teachers are critical because it helps the student succeed, saves time, and promotes learning.\n \n If students were allowed to be completely in control of their summer work, they would chose one of three things: not to do it, do only the topics they are comfortable with, or chose something they are actually interested in. Most students will opt for not doing these assignments and having the summer for themselves. However, when the students arrive back at school, not having done any work to prepare for the school year, the teachers will have to take time in class to reteach everything that was learned in the previous year. These summer assignments are difficult, but they without-a-doubt help a student succeed. Personally, when I was given an optional summer assignments, I did not complete it and I struggled immensely with the curriculum until I took the time to actually review the material. I have no doubt that if I had done that summer assignment I would have had a much better start to the year. With this option available to students to \"self-design,\" the students will not properly prepare themselves as much as teachers will, and therefore will not succeed as much.\n \n When summer assignments are given, it allows for students to refresh themselves on the topics that they had learned previously, and perhaps new topics that they will be covering in the coming year. This allows for the teachers to briefly cover what was learned previously and then move on to new topics. If teachers didn't design the summer assignment, then these topics would have to be reviewed in class before starting any new topics. This makes the first few weeks of the school year even more chaotic because every teacher will have to speed through each of the topics necessary for the curriculum in order to make up that time.\n \n Also, when students learn some of the topics before coming to school, it helps the teacher get though the topics quicker by not having to explain as much. When the students do not have the summer assignments designed by the teacher, they do not learn the new topics, and therefore have to spend more time on them in class. For example, most classes have summer assignments so that they can avoid having to review a bunch of material before learning the new curriculum. Given these points, teacher-designed summer assignments are critical to save time for the new information to be covered during the year.\n \n Finally, these summer assignments promote independent learning for students. They teach students how to find information and time management, which are necessary skills for college and future careers. Research based summer assignments are valuable to learning because they are flexible in the structuring but also cover the topics necessary. If a teacher told students to write a short essay to summarize a few topics that they have learned or are interested in learning about, the students will apply themselves more than having to write out ten pages of notes on a book. This type of summer assignment requires actual thinking and creativity from a student. When a student is given fifty math problems they have done before, they learn nothing, but when given twenty and a small creativity based project, they will actually fully apply themselves to the work. This will also cause students to not resent the work that they are doing and hopefully cause for a better school year to come.\n \n For these reasons I agree that there should be teacher-designed summer assignments, but I also believe that they should be more engaging and interesting for students so that they apply themselves and retain the information. The summer assignments that the teachers assign now are not engaging in the least and cause the students to dread having to come back to school. I think that the core topics that need to be reviewed should be given by the teacher, but that the teacher should allow for the students to work creatively on part of the assignment, this may cause for less dread by the students. With these types of assignments, both the teachers and students can be successful during the coming school year.Â",

    essay: "Schools always want what is best for their students, giving them summer projects so that they can continue learning during their summer break is an amazing idea. However, having student-designed projects would not be the best option to go with. Teacher-designed projects would have more of an impact on students in continuing their education outside of school than having them do a project designed by students themselves. Teacher-designed projects and student-designed projects are both great ideas but the projects that the teachers have made themselves in a better route to go. A teacher's project would not only be more beneficial towards the future of students and push them to go to greater lengths with their knowledge but they will also assure that the what student is doing that will actually help them learn during their summer vacation.\n \n Children are the future and should think wisely about their life in the long run so that they can have the best life possible. All successful lifestyles do not always start with going to college, getting your degree, and finding a well-paying job it can start from inside your garage like Steve Jobs did to create\n \n Apple . Although not all will be as lucky as Steve Jobs. Therefore, it would be a wise choice for students to go to college to get their life started on the right track. Projects like the ones given out during break could possibly prepare them for what they will see when they do go to college. Especially if they take honors or AP classes during high school, unfortunatelyÂ those projects will be a bit more difficult but they will be more beneficial so that the students to know what to expect in the long run.\n \n These projects will also push the students to go to greater lengths and actually think it out for themselves without asking for a teachers help or looking it up online. With that, giving the students a project made to further their education and challenge them a tad bit would be a project made by certified educators themselves. Being challenged is an essential thing to do to everyone. Therefore, the student will know that they are smarter than what they believe when they finally understand some work that may be a little challenging. Giving students even the littlest push will be better than them not trying at all. Students should think for themselves and want to challenge themselves and not try to cheat off others or from online sources. Student-designed projects would not give students the kick start that they need in life.\n \n Although having student-designed projects would be more creative and within the comfort zone of the students, having a teacher-designed project would most likely achieve the goal of the students learning during summer vacation. Assuring that the students do indeed learn during their duration away from school is a big factor of giving them teacher-designed projects. Teachers could give out projects that are fun, educational, and challenging keeping in mind it will still be teaching them from outside of the classroom. It would not help the the student nor the teacher if the student learn nothing from their summer project. It would be more stress on both people, more teaching for the teaching and more work and learning for the student. Therefore, them learning from outside the classroom would be greatly achieved by the teachers making the projects for the students.\n \n Given these reasons, teachers should be the only ones making summer projects for their students. Being more beneficial towards the future of the students, pushing them to go to greater lengths with their knowledge and assuring that they are actually learning is better than having easy projects that can be done within fifteen minutes. Students at least be given the opportunity to create a project and allow a teacher to look over it to see if it falls under those 3 reasons. Teachers should also try to at least make it enjoyable for everyone not just for the students it would be pretty boring to grade a boring project. The teacher could listen to ideas of the students and combine them together to make everyone happy.",

    essay: "Creativity is the heart of our current society, when given the opportunity those who have the ability to think outside the box create unimaginably beautiful things. In schools students arent given the opportunity to be as creative as they could be because of how restrictive and bland the projects and assignments made by teachers are. If our society depends on the creativity and skill setÂ of the current generation in schools why not give them the opportunity to develop their skills and be able to flourish in their own success? Which is why I think that summer projects should be student designed because its helps students learn to become more creative and helps prepare them for the future.\n \n Students usually spend their summer either sleeping or just having fun with their friends trying to make the most out of the break but as students reach high schools they find that they have to do projects over the summer. Almost all students are annoyed at the fact that they have to do a summer project for a class and most of them leave it till the last second to actually do it. If students were allowed to design these projects themselves it would give them the will and incentive to do it because they would have designed it in a way that it would seem interesting to them. It would help break away from their habit of carelessly doing it and having them get creative with their project and make something astonishing,\n \n By letting students design their own projects to do over the summer it also helps them develop real life skills that they can use in the workplace. Students dont tend to learn anything new over the summer since they are focused on their break and enjoying it as much as possible but doing a project that takes time and interests them helps them learn what goes into making a project and what the requirements are. This helps students to use their new foundÂ abilities in the workplace to much more easily express their creativity since they now know the tools to show it.\n \n When teachers make summer projects for students it makes it harder for a student to care about the project because they didnt really have a part in making it, so if the teachers decide on making a project based on a topic a student doesnt like they wouldnt be as interested. It would lead to them wanting to do the bear minimum and be done with it, never even inspiring them use their creativity. Which is why when a student makes their own project they can be more creative and choose a topic or idea that interests them related to the class doing their best effort to portray how much they care about it.\n \n It could be argued that if students made their own projects they would make it easy that it wouldnt take any time for them to finish it. Although some students would just want to be done with their project and do something easy most students would want to use this project as an opportunity to get their point and ideas across. When a person cares about something they want it to be the best , so when a student designs a project in whichÂ they care about they would obviously want to do their best since they put so much work into it. So saying that a student wouldnt care about a project they created would be wrong since even if they did design a bad project they would be the one doing it and would make it much harder for themselves.\n \n There is so much good that can come out of letting students design their own projects not only for them but for their future as well. If teachers give students the opportunity to design their own project then they would be teaching more than the class but skills they can use in the future as well. Since creativity is the backbone of everything in the world when teachers start to make new ideas to have students think more creatively it helps the development of new ideas and innovations in the future.",

    essay: "Is it fair to have teachers design summer projects for students on break? During school, projects are normally done throughout the course to show a student's understanding of a subject. Most schools don't assign summer projects for the student body since summer is supposed to be the break time. Some schools do give out summer projects, but keep in mind, the projects themselves, despite being assigned during break, aren't usually designed by students. Summer projects should be student-designed because people work better with ideas they're familiar with, this gives students more freedom with subjects for a project, and students are more willing to do something they want to do or research.\n \n When working on projects, its easier to work with something you're familiar with than anything else. Making a project on a familiar concept means students would be able to write more in-depth about it. They'd also be able to understand it better since looking something up doesn't always give you enough info about a subject. Imagine trying to write a in-depth analysis on Didgeridoos when you've never even heard of one or even have background information on instruments. Familiarity with your work makes it come to you naturally and having the freedom to choose the subject of a project is important.\n \n Being able to choose what you're working with will make a project more enjoyable. Most of the time, teacher-assigned projects would have all the students doing or researching the same thing. While this makes the assignment easier to grade and gives everyone a common goal, some people want to look somewhere else. Choosing your subject could bring about interesting results and give you a new interest rather than just being given the generic science project where you monitor and grow a small plant for x amount of time. Working on something you, personally, picked out could also inspire you to put more work into the assignment.\n \n Being willing to do your work helps greatly with work ethic and attitude towards the work. Researching a subject that interests you, rather than something else, would make anyone more productive. There are lots of ideas people would look further into if prompted and this would be that prompt. Students would be able to enjoy looking up information on subjects interesting to them and put them on paper. They'd be able to turn in a well-written paper and get a good grade just for researching a fun subject.\n \n In conclusion, having students create their own summer projects would be highly beneficial towards productivity on said project. The benefits outweight the negatives and more students would work harder on these projects. Being limited to certain ideas will make it so students don't try as hard to think outside the box. This type of work also helps students find things they're interested in for later. All of these things would help them work better and earn better results, but they'd also find more information and learn better this way and isn't that the point of all this?",

    essay: "Most kids don't like school as it is and its boring to them. The student-designed summer project would be better in their favor Because studens don't get to say much besides ask questions, and They have more say and more of a voice, and not every student learns the same, and summer is better than the school year because you can do more outside activities.\n \n The project would be great for students to learn and have fun because you can do things like have a lessons with the activities where the kids can pick between thing because not all kids like everything to be just told to them. kids feel better when they can have fun and everything isn't crammed in their brains for 7 hours a day. Which would make them tired and not ready to learn. This would be perfect for students who are hands on type of learners. They can be hands on because the project is student based. Not every kid learns the same so kids who learn differently would be more comfortable because its not a 7 hour classroom environment where they just sit in class all day.\n \n Student would have more say or more of a voice because is about them.\n \n During the school year in the fall and winter because the teacher basically run the class and they teach they way they want and the kids just listen. By making the project student based students can present thier feelings and their feedback about what they like and don't like. It can also help teacher get a better undestanding about their students. They can also create bonds with new people such as students and teachers. Nobody want to be taught by a teacher they don't like. This will cause kids not being motivated to learn from the teacher and will probably cause bad behavior.\n \n The project willalso make kid have more fun and they'll probably like school. You can do more activies that kids will like, like going to the pool, or planning a picnic, or just playing on a playground. You could make it so that it could be a lesson in each activity. Then they will learn while having fun. It wold be a win for everyone. It can just belittle insintives that they can get because of the weather and little brain breaks so they dont get overwelmed. Students already don't like going to school and making it fun and in their favor will make them want to come.\n \n In conclusion students would overall like the summer project that is student designed over teacher disigned because not every student learns the same, students get more of a voice which means they get to pick between things they like, and school is just better in the summer because of the outside activities you can do.",

The projects can be on topics students really understand and actually have interest in.

    essay: "Many schools require their students to complete a summer project during break to assure that they continue learning while not in school. Some are simple, such as writing an essay about events that happen over the summer, while others are long and grueling such as keeping a detailed log of every day, which is something one teachers from Generic_School had us do. Some students however, find teacher-designed assignments to be a chore and a struggle because they are not interesting or engaging. In order to fix this problem,Â I believe that summer projects should be student-designed because the students can choose topics that will interest them and engage them, and because the projects will feel more relevant and engaging to students in similar age groups.\n \n By giving students the chance to choose their own project topic, it will insure that they will stay interested. For example, a few years ago, my band teacher sent us home before break with a project in which we would have to design our own marching band show and theme, the only restriction being that it had to be able toÂ be performed in under eight minutes. Everyone in the class was super excited to begin right away and many of us began planning and researching almost immediately. The amount of freedom given to us by our teacher made the project thrilling and the possibilities were endless! When we all got back from break, it was obvious how much work everyone had put into their projects and how passionate they were about them. There were dozens themes ranging from classic Rock and Roll to Star Wars. By giving us the freedom to choose the themes of our projects, my band teacher found a way to engage us all in an educational and enjoyable experience.\n \n Giving students the freedom to design their own projects also would insure that the project will be engaging and relevant to students in similar age groups. About a year ago, I went to a two-week engineering summer camp at a college I am interested in attending. There were students there from tenth through twelfth grade from all over the state, and the camp itself was actually run by a group of college students and a few professors. Over the course of the camp we learned all about engineering and future career fields we may be interested in, but we also were given an assignment. We had to design models of an Earth themed school in groups with the materials they provided before the end of the camp. To be honest, I had expected that we would have to take a test or fill out some questionnaire on what we had learned, given that we were at a college, so this was a nice surprise. Turns out that it was in fact the college students, and not the professors, who were in charge coming up with this project. Since they were not much older than us, they knew how to get us to apply the knowledgeÂ that we had learned in a way that we would enjoy. If all projects were done like this, I'm sure many of them would be of much higher quality than a teacher-designed project.\n \n However, there are some benefits to doing a teacher-designed project rather than a student-designed one. For one thing, rules and guidelines would most likely be very clear. One year, one of my elementary school teachers decided to let us do our own summer projects based on the events of our summer, and we would have to show up next September to present it to the class in a creative way. Let's just say that things did not work out in the end. I was one of about five students to get an A on the project because either the other kids just wrote things down on a sheet of notebook paper because they didn't know what else to do, or they had forgotten all about the assignment over the break. If the teacher had decided to give us all a few options to pick from for the project, there would most likely have been more A's.\n \n I do believe that there are real benefits in requiring students to complete projects over summer break, but I do wish that more teachers would give students more freedoms when it comes to selecting them. By using the students' input, students will be more interested in the assignment and will be more likely to complete them. If more teachers allowed students to select their own topics for these projects, the quality of the projects would most likely be better because it would be about something that the student was passionate about. If all teachers allowed more students to give suggestions and input into their lessons and projects, then the overall quality of schools and the desire to learn would increase.",

Now what if you had to do a project that required you to stay home for 6 weeks, but you were gone all summer? What if you had absolutely no interest in a topic you had to research? Rather than being teacher designed, school summer projects should be student-designed because it gives the students more motivation to complete the project, students enjoy doing assignments in which they are interested in, and it gives students a better opportunity to succeed.\n \n Students have more motivation to complete a project, if they are able to decide what it is that they will be doing. For instance, if I had to complete a project that required me to stay at the beach all day, I would totally do it! No one wants to do a project they have no interest in, therefore they have no sense of motivation to get it done. No basketball enthusiast wants to write a 4 page paper on the French Revolution.\n \n Not only does a student have more motivation to complete it, but they actually enjoy doing it too.

This is help students continue to learn and keep their brains active during summer break. Summer assignments also help students prepare for their incoming classes by learning concepts before the year starts. To better benefit the student, summer assignments should be teacher-designed because teachers have more knowledge of the course curriculum and many students need a teacher who can lead them through new concepts of the class.\n \n Summer assignments are designed to help students maintain an active mind and prepare for their upcoming classes by learning course concepts before the school year starts. Teachers are trained for years to master the subject they are going to teach and mostly likely have already seen or learned the material in the class they are going teaching. Students do not know the course curriculum before they have taken the class. If the summer assignment was designed by the students, the assignment would not be as beneficially because students do not know what the curriculum of the class is.\n \n For example, in classes I have always been give assignments created by my teachers. But, one class my teacher gave us an open ended project where students could create their own project using our ideas. All the kids in my class took weeks and even months to find an idea for their project.Â The students in my class had no idea what the teacher was looking for and how to correlate their ideas into the class curriculum. However, a teacher already knows the curriculum. This will allows for a more efficient and beneficial way of learning for the student because the teacher can create assignments they know is related to the course.\n \n Not only do student not know the course concepts, students also do not have the skills to create assignments; students need a teacher leader to guide them through the new class. When learning a new concept, students can become overwhelmed if they do not understand the topics. At my school, some classes have very little guidance from teachers to help the students understand a new topic. My friends in these classes become very overwhelmed and become more apathetic to the class. Students do not understand how to learn a new without the guidance of a teacher. A teachers job is to create assignments, tests, and projects to lead their students towards mastering a concept. When teachers create assignments they are more involved with guiding their students. If summer assignments were student-designed there would be a lack of guidance compared to an assignment made from a teacher would have. This would causes students to inefficiently learn through summer assignments.\n \n People who support student-designed summer assignments may argue that advanced placement (AP) classes require students to learn from textbooks without the guidance of a teacher so students do not need teacher guidance. But when taking a look at the students in these AP classes, on average students in AP classes struggle and receive poor grades in these classes. This is due to the lack of teacher leadership in these classes. Students in AP classes do not get enough guidance to fully understand the curriculum.\n \n Summer assignments should be teacher-designed because teachers have more knowledge on the course curriculum and students need teacher guidance while learning new concepts. Summer assignments would be more effective if the teachers created the assignments themselves. Summer assignments that effectively teach students the curriculum over summer break will help benefit the students during the school year.",

    essay: "Over the summer homework is not the best, hence, why teachers do not give it to students very often. giving homework over summer is not really good but what if it was student designed or student designed. There is an ongoing debate on whether summer projects should be student or teacher-designed and the benefits of each. Teachers being the ones to design the project can lead to: students having clear standards of what needs to be done, more time managed project, and being stressed out. Some may that student design is better due to boosting tier moral and letting the project being something they can enjoy. Although some may disagree having a teacher designed project over school is more efficient and safe.\n \n Teacher design based projects will be a lotÂ safer for the most part; Moreover, leaving less room for students to say something like not understanding,not enough time, and being stressed out. first thing is not knowing the standards of the project or understanding them. This could lead to a lotÂ of hiccups if this was a student designed project; Consequently stressing the students out. Time management is also crucial due even if a student has an entire summer. letting teachers plan the time it would best to gradually get it done would be great expecting it not to being able to be finish the day before its due. Some students might put it off until they cant any more probably messing up their sleep schedule trying to rush to finish the project Being stressed out is not a great feeling and can ultimately be a reason some students may just give up. Even if it is all planned out a multitude of factors kick in to be able to stress a student.\n \n There are further reasons to letting the project be designed by the teacher. This can help grades if the project is done, can later reward the students by the teacher having faith in the students to do a multitude of other things. These rewards can help students want to finish projects and have a reason to be doing projects on time. Letting a student design his or her own project is a privilege and will ultimately be earned and boosting confidence getting closer to a student designed summer project. One problem for lots of students is that during the summer a lot of things are forgotten. I think having a project made by a teacher can help challenge the brain and keep it ready for when school is about to began. Doing that can improve performance in school on a daily basis.\n \n Although some may disagree, the projects given over summer should be teacher-designed to limit problems.\n \n The summer projects should be teacher designed due to the benefits given to students like limiting time management problems, helping students be ready for the upcoming your and what to look out for. some state that student designed projects wold be better due to less of a workload and boosting moral but this is not the case. Getting teacher designed projects is a great benefit and less of a work load in the future and can set an example for students wanting to earn being able to have a student designed project.",

The time we live on right now students should get projects over the summer, so they can prepared for college and other things in life this is why the schools are giving them work so they dont forget about school and keep learning everyday. While some people around the world say that teachers should design the summer project for the students. It is better for the students to design their own summer project because they have better ideas, Can make their projects less stressful, and make it more fun with their friends.\n \n All students in the world have better ideas to how to design your own project and make it better. Students have better understanding of what they want to do for there project like having better ideas and knowing what they want to work on. Cristiano Ronaldo wrote a article about why is good students should design their projects and why teacher should let them design their own article. Cristiano Ronaldo is a soccer star but he went to high school and know what the students want to do and design. He wrote on the article that students brain is still developing;he said that if students keep making their own decision and teachers let them choose their designs of projects they can come up with better ideas that other people cannot even think about. In the article he wrote that we students have a amazing brain and we can come u with the best ideas and design of projects that no one else can't. Everyone keep saying that teachers should make the designs of students projects for the summer.\n \n Students of everywhere can make there project design less stressful if they get to choose what they can do. When students get to design there own project is less stressful for them because they can choose how they want to do it.\n \n Leonel Messi came to every high school in the united states to talk about how stressful is when teacher give students projects over the summer. They make us work super hard and is super hard to communicate with their teacher over the summer. He talk to us that picking our own projects is way better than teachers picking the design because we can make our own ideas and it is less stressful and that is going to be easier. When students pick their design they don't need to worry about asking question to their teacher and stressing out. Messi told us that when he was in high school,he used to choose his own design of project because it was less stressful and more fun to do. when people keep saying that teacher should choose our design it so stressful because us as student want to choose our design for our summer project.\n \n People in all high schools keep saying that is more fun for students to make our design of project ,because it makes our studies more fun and incredible. The mother of my friend ones told me that there is nothing more fun than getting to design a project as a student. She told me that when she was in high school their teacher choose the project for them and that wasn't fun for no student. That's why she told me that is more fun to get to choose your own design of project because when teachers get to choose them is super boring and stressful students sometimes cry. She told me that If i had the chance to make my own design to take it because it was not going to be fun to if the teacher choose the design. It is going to be more fun if you get to choose your own design for the summer project because i can get to make it with my friends and probably family members. Never let your teacher choose design the summer project for the students.\n \n While other people might say that these summer projects should be teacher designed because the student keep learning more and keep working hard;however, if students make their own summer project design it is way better because student have better ideas, less stressful, and get to have more fun while doing the project. Messi gave us a great talk about how to choose your own design of project can make every students less stressful. Students around the world have a ruff time trying to do projects that their teacher gives them over the summer. Teachers should let students choose their own design so students can relax and have fun over the summer and they can keep doing there project and still have time to have fun with family and friends. Every student around the world should start making their own design for their project. Â  Â",

Opposed to teachers, the students will find something effortless and easy to do. At that point it wouldnt be a challenge and they won't learn anything new. It wouldnt be a very difficult project either. It would just be hard enough to be a challenge to the students so they can spend more time learning about the subject instead of looking them up on the internet. Teacher wants the best for the students so they wouldn't give something out that they know you won't be able to do it.\n \n Therefore, A teacher wouldn;t give out a project without teaching about it first. A teacher would give an example and teach you about the project so it won't be that hard on you anyways. students would know ahead of time if they have an issue with the teaching method or the project itself. It could help parents know what to do and how to help there own child with there project or anything else throughout the year. so i think its a good idea for the student to pay attention in the class when the teacher is explaining it.\n \n Also, when you have a problem or an issue you can always ask the teacher. you can via text or email the teacher whenever you have an issue or a problem with the project. Dont understand the material just email your teacher and she will respond when she is able to. Even if you and someone else has the same problem then you two can work it out. You can contact your teacher and say that multiple people are having the same issues and it'sÂ not only you. If this was a student-designed project then it would be hard and wouldn't know who to ask.\n \n In conclusion, there are many teachers who worry about there student. They think that they will forget everything that they have learned about. It could be possibly true that students can forget what they have learned and so it a good idea to give summer break projects so they can keep refreshing there minds about the topic that they learned about. I feel like the slotions for students to not forget aboout what they learned is summer break projects. These summer projects should be teacher- designed so the projects can be a challenge for the students, the teachers would be able to provide the studentsÂ help when they have a question about the project, it will be easier for the students. teachers should provide a challenge, also will be given a short lesson on what it is on.",

    essay: "Summer projects help the students learn during the summer and become prepared for the next school year. Although some may say teachers are more experiencedÂ at giving projects because they have been doing it longer; Summer projects should be student-designed, because students will probably not be in that same class with the same teacher next school year, it will be more enjoyed by students, and student are on there break from school and still have to do school work.\n \n First, the students will enjoy the summer project more because the students picked it. The students would also put more work and effort in to the project becauseÂ it can be about someone admired by the student(s) or can be a career choice in the future. Students would be able to do a project on sports, history, engineering, animals, and even health of the human body. There would be interest in the project with that students do not have to do the repeated subject that is in class or a boring assignment the teacher does not care about. When students enjoy a project the subject and possibilities can be limitless and full of imagination.\n \n Secondly, if a teacher gives a summer project to the students nine out of ten of the students will not be in the same class next school year unless the class was an elective class and the students(s) chose to do it again. While having a different teacher next school year the project may or may not be cared for because of the subject difference and the teacher is not worried about what another teacher is teaching. Furthermore, the project may not even be graded by the new teacher so the student should have a project that can related or help them out of the school community. Also the project should be something the student can do without needing teacher assistance in case that the prompt of the project is not clear or the student has trouble finding information on the project.\n \n Last but not the least, during the summer students have a break to relax from all the things students do in school. The students already have to do a project that would be preferred not to do ,so instead of having a teacher design the project having a project that can benefit the students will help them in every day life. Most students take vacations during summer time so having a project that is designed by students can give them ideas on what to do on vacation. The students would have a guide or set up exactly the way the students want it and model the project with out frustration.\n \n In conclusion, If a student is forced to do a teacher designed project the students will be helpless, misled, and extremely bored during the summer. A project made by students can be enjoyed while also educating and preparing the student for the future while having a amazing summer.Â",

    essay: "I believe school summer projects should be student-designed. Student-designed projects will help a student express their creativity, it will be less complicated, and it will let them learn about a topic they are interested in. If the project is student-designed, it is most likely for them to keep up with it and not set it aside. Students should be trusted to build something on what they learned on their own.\n \n Even though not all students come up with astonishing ideas, all of them have the capacity to be creative. Creativity is important when it comes to projects. It helps a project look presentable, it also helps the audience gain interest. Students can let their imagination discover more ideas when a project is not teacher-designed because their options are not limited. Not only will it be more exciting to do a project, but it will increase students' grade by showing their creativity.\n \n A student-designed project will relieve stress from students by being able to create whatever they please. Instead of having to assemble something difficult given by a teacher, a student will choose an easier option for themselves, so they will not build up pressure. Since they will most likely pick a non difficultÂ idea, they can complete their project faster. Therefore, students will enjoy their summer break more.\n \n Furthermore, most students will choose an option they are intrigued in, which makes a project become more interesting.Â Students will pick one out of a variety that they enjoy; they will stay on task.

    essay: "Should summer projects be teacher designed or student designed? In my opinion they should be teacher-designed. Why? you might ask. Well if there teacher-designed you would already know what to do, all you have to do is follow instructions. With a teacher designed project it will also be more put together and less confusion. And you wouldnt have to worry about finding a topic or how should you go about things.\n \n As you know students tend to procrastinate. So if we were to design our own project do you still think we would procrastinate? The answer to that question is yes. If we were to have the opportunity to design our own project we wouldnt have the right mindset. Most students mindset towards a project of their choice is \"oh I already know what I want to do it'll be easy Ill do it a week before school.\" Then a week before school your stressed and trying to throw everything together. And when you get to school you'll blame it on the teachers as if their the ones who told you to wait till last minute. Even though they gave you the opportunity to design your own project, and do it on something you were eager about.\n \n The goal of a summer project is to make sure that students are still getting some type of education during the summer. Teacher designed projects would have more of a lesson to it than a student designed one. There would actually be a reasoning to the project. A student designed project would be more of what they like based project. In order to know that the student is gaining information from the project I feel as if it should be created by the teacher.\n \n Students come back to school from summer break completely clueless of anything they have learned last year. And in order to make sure that this doesnt keep happening each generation teachers have to design a summer project. Notice I said teachers not students. Teachers went to school ,and got their GED or diploma. So they know more than we do so they can insure that we get all the information we need.\n \n In conclusion teachers want the best for students they wouldnt create a project were it isnt benefiting the student.

    essay: "Over the summer, very few students have the desire to do any homework, especially not a project. In the scenario where a school mandates a summer project, the summer project should be student-designed. Having student-designed projects would make the assignment easier for students to complete and it would also ensure that the students are gaining knowledge from completing the assignment. Assigning a project that isn't grueling and time consuming, as teacher-designed projects tend to be, would result in more students completing the assignment and learning.\n \n Many students never complete projects during the regular school year, and assigning a summer project would seem like an impossible task. However, if the project appealed to students it would be more likely that they would complete it and this could spark a butterfly effect that leads into the next year for those students. It would cause students who don't complete projects or assignments, to turn into consistent, non-procrastinating students. Learning is often made into a very monotonous and dreadful thing but if schools designed learning for students, intelligence would be more spread out across the school. There wouldn't be the groups of \"smart kids\", the groups of \"dumb kids\", or the groups of \"average kids\" and the school, as a whole, would be more successful.\n \n A very typical and repetitive summer project is \"summer reading\". Many schools don't assign this as a mandatory project that is expected to be completed by every student, but is often assigned as a prerequisite to enter high level English classes or to join certain clubs. When the school year begins, a lot of very educated and worthy students are denied the ability to attend that high level class because they haven't completed the summer reading project. Now the logic behind this is, \"If a student can't read one book over the summer, how can they be expected to read multiple books throughout the entire English course ?\". What many people don't take into account, is the fact that regardless of a teenager's intelligence, they will usually neglect all school work until the last minute and end up forgetting. They will either end up not being able to fully put their knowledge to use, or lying about reading in order to enter a class, neither of these outcomes benefit the student.\n \n An argument against these claims would be, \"If teacher-designed projects are assigned, it will be easier for teachers to grade the assignment and this could benefit the student even more by giving them a better grade and better feedback.\". Teacher-designed projects are capable of this, and students would be able to receive more well-rounded, and understood grades if the assignment was being graded based off of a rubric. With a teacher-assigned project, teachers can compare each student's work to past projects that have been completed by other students and accurately determine how good the project is. These types of projects ensure that all students will learn the same amount by eliminating the option for students to do projects about something they are already very educated about in their personal life.\n \n Student-designed projects are more reliable and consistent than teacher-designed projects. They allow students to fully display their intelligence and academic potential. They also allow students to educate themselves about a topic. This leads to better learning habits in the future; and overall, it can turn a good student into an even better student.Â",

    essay: "In my opinion, the summer project should be a student-designed. I take this certain position on the question because students can explain what they've learned in their own way. I would be easier for the student to do the project of a topic that they are comfortable with. If the student can choose what they want the project to be about then, its a possibility that they would want to do the project more rather than if the teacher was picking it. I also feel that if the student might not be confident in all of the material they have learned, there is a possibility they could have something that they are strong in and they can choose to do their project on that topic.\n \n Don't you want the student to inform you on what they have learned since school ended? This is why I feel this project should be student-designed. I think that if the student chooses what they want their project to be on, the school would see what each individual student has learned truly. If the teacher was to design the same project for each student to do, it wouldn't show how every student has each learned something different. If every studentÂ does a different project or does a different way of doing their project, it would show how much the school cares about what they have learned.\n \n It would also be easier for the student to do the project on a topic they are comfortable with. If a student is confident in certain things, they can do the project on one of those topics. It would be hard to do a project on something that the teacher designed if the student didn't understand it that much. It could've been hard for the student to grasp the concept and if they picked it themselves it would save them the trouble of struggling to do the project. So basically, If you would want the students to do the project, it would be best to let them choose.\n \n Some students do really like the idea of doing projects. I believe if they are able to chose what to do their project on, they would actually do the project. Students tend to not like to do projects that teachers assign them. It could be a possibility that it's because its not interesting enough for them to care. So if you really want the students to do the project, I suggest you let them choose. In fact, you'd never know if you would be intrigued by what each student learned.\n \n In conclusion, my position is that the project should be student-designed. As I am bringing my ideas together it makes since because they want to know what the students have learned, so they should let the students show them. However, if they were to choose teacher-designed, they wouldn't get much feedback of what the students learned, in my opinion. So my position is student-designed. Â Â Â",

She recorded the information thrilled to present her project when school started again. Some schools require students to complete a summer project to assure they continue learning during their break. Although a teacher-designed project could help prepare students for the next school year, summer projects should be student-designed because they can do a project on something that interests them, decide how extravagant they want it to be and they are more likely to do it.\n \n To begin with, students should design their own projects so they can do something that interests them. For example, Generic_Name was extremely interested in robotics. She loved designing different robots that could do many things, such as feeding a baby, turning on a light and drawing. When she heard about the summer project, she decided she wanted to create a robot that could write her name. Generic_Name immediately began planning how it would look, if it would write in cursive and how fast it would write. She spent her summer building, redesigning and perfecting her robot. By the time school started, Generic_Name had built a robot that wrote her name perfectly and got a one hundred on her summer project.\n \n Secondly, students can decide how extravagant they want their project to be. For example, Generic_Name was extremely busy during the summer. She had to go to camp, do the summer musical and marching band thus she did not have much free time to do her project. Generic_Name did not want to do a time consuming project but still wanted an A so she went online to discover how to make bottle rockets. It only took one day to do and she could easily finish it and still have time to do everything she wanted to. However, her friend Generic_Name was not doing anything over the summer. She wanted to do something that would take all summer but would also give her enough time to be with her friends and family. She decided to do an art project that showed the most interesting and oldest parts of her city. She went downtown everyday to paint bridges, buildings, and the view of the city from the roofs of buildings. She was able to show her city's history through her paintings and show her talent.\n \n Lastly, students are more likely to do their projects if they design it. For example, Generic_Name assigned the students a project on the book they were reading. The students did not find the project interesting and most either waited until the night before to do it or did not do the project at all. Most of Generic_Name students failed the assignment or barely passed. However, Generic_Name allowed his students to choose the project that most interested them from a list. They had many different options, such as making a play list, drawing a picture or rewriting the ending. Most of his students were interested in at least one of the options and those who were not could ask him if they could do something that interested them. The students enjoyed working on the project and seeing what their classmates had done.\n \n In conclusion, students should be able to design their own summer projects because they can do a project on something that interests them, decide how extravagant they want it to be and they are more likely to do it. Teachers who let their students choose a project that interests them will have higher project grades than teachers who choose their students projects.Â",

    essay: "Summer is known as the time when students get to have a long break from their studies. However, some schools continue the education of the students by assigning summer projects. Most of the time, these projects are created by the teachers. Now, some schools are starting to allow the students to choose both the topic of their summer project and the method of completion, as opposed to everyone getting the same assignment from the teacher. Summer projects should be student designed, because students have individual interests, they have their own project styles, and teachers will have less issues to deal with.\n \n Every student in the entire world is different. Everyone has a favorite topic that they like to research or study. Summer vacation is supposed to be a time to relax and take a break from school, so forcing them to research a topic that they do not enjoy takes away from the relaxation of summer. Students would be much happier to research a topic that they personally enjoy. If someone is a big fan of history, they would much rather do a project on the first world war than on biology. The students would also do a better job on the project, because they may already have lots of knowledge on their topic. They would also put more work into the project itself, since it is about something they enjoy.\n \n Similarly, everyone has a prefered method of completing a project. Some would like to record a skit or news report for their project, while others may want to build a scale model. If they are able to choose their project completion method, students will also do a better job on the project, since they will most likely pick a method that they are already experienced at. Someone who studies engineering will be able to build a much better model of a house then someone who studies theater.\n \n Summer projects will also be more enjoyable for teachers. A teacher is usually a student's first resource when it comes to asking questions about an assignment. Teachers will be asked a lot less questions if the students pick topic that they enjoy and have a thorough understanding of. There will also be less lazy or unfinished work for the teachers to sift through at the end of summer, because students will be more motivated to complete the assignment if it is about a topic that they like and a method that they like.\n \n Some may say that teachers need to make summer assignments, because it will lead to a more consistent grading scale, but it will still be easier to grade the projects consistantly if it is all quality work that the student enjoyed completing. Summer projects will be much more enjoyed by the students if they get to pick their own topics and methods of completion, and by the the teachers, because they will have an easier time with assisting and grading students",

    essay: "Imagine getting told you are required to do a summer project for school but you have to come up with the whole project by yourself. Some schools require students to do summer projects to make sure they keep learning all summer. Some schools would also like to know if the projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Although it would be easier on students, the projects should be teacher-designed. Schools that require students to do summer projects should be teacher designed because there would be less stress for students, the projects would be easier to grade, and it would most likely be less work for teachers throughout the summer.\n \n Teacher-designed projects would have less stress on the students. If the students had to come up with the project there would most likely be a lotÂ of missing projects. Most high schoolÂ students have jobs and sports in the summer which would make having a summer project hard. Jobs and school is hard at the same time so having a teacher at leastÂ give you and idea would take stress away. Students having to come up with the project would also be a lotÂ harder for the teacher to grade.\n \n Teacher-designed projects would also be easier to grade. If the teacher has the idea already ready for the student then she knows what to expect. She would also know the requirements and it would be easier to give a grade. Grading is very time consuming so things to make that easier for them is probably appreciated. The teacher knowing what kind of projects she will have to grade when school starts again will be a lotÂ less stressful for her when grading starts.\n \n Teacher-designed projects would also be a lotÂ less work for the teacher. Yes, the teachers have to come up with a lotÂ of different ideas for the students. However, it will be a lotÂ less work throughout the summer. Some students might have a lotÂ of questions about how to do the project or ask for help. To the teacher that might be frustrating in her break from school. Teachers like there school break just as much as students.\n \n If it was up to me the summer projects should be teacher-designed. The teachers probably wont like that idea very much because its a little extra work but it would be a lotÂ less stressful. Teacher designed projects would be easier because there is less stress for students, teachers would have an easier time grading them, and the teachers would have less work throughout the summer.",

    essay: "Summer is a part of the year were students and families can take it easy and relax. Their are many things to do over the summer, students generally spend their time at the ; beaches, pools, a relatives house, and even at a summer job. With all of these activites sometimes students forget what they have learned in school. This is a big problem because everything you learn at school builds up on itself and gets more advanced as you continue through the year. Some school countys realized this and decided to take action. Their solution was to assign summer projects so that the students can retain the information they just learned in there current school year. Many students don't like the idea of summer assignments because it takes away from their break from school. If it was teacher-designed students wouldn't be motived to complete it, if it was student-designed students wouldn't learn the right material. That leads us to the question, should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed?\n \n When students are required to do something they aren't particually intrested in, they start to lack motivation or intrest. The same logic can be compared to summer assignments, if the project isn't intresting to students, they probably won't give it a lot of their effort. Which also leaves students to hold it off until the end of the summer. The solution to this problem would be to make the projects student-designed. When you assign yourself with a project you tend to do it with more motivation and more reasoning. This is because when you assign yourself something it is usually done with a reason and you have motivation to complete it.\n \n Some might argue that the project should be teacher-designed because the teacher knows what the students learned and whats best for them, doing so, would help the student retain information important to the teacher, thus setting them up for success next school year. This is a very intresting point and it is understandable to have the teacher explain whats best for them. Though it still doesn't keep the student motivated. As explained before, students work better when they work on assignments designed by them. This helps the student stay motivated to retain the information better rather than putting it off and waiting till the end of summer.\n \n The way the project will work is as follows, the student will be given options by the teacher as to what project ideas are avalible, as chosen by the majority of the class. The student will then be given a way to work on the project, this could be a posterboard, presentation slide show, or a physical demonstration. Then they will have all summer to work on it. When they comeback to school they will be required to present their project to the class. That way the students inform others as well as retain information for the new school year. To motivate to students even more they will be given a grade on how well they do on the project. That way they will be set up for success.\n \n In conclusion, the projects would be more benifital to the students if they were student designed. That way students can retain the information during the summer as well as having a good time over the break. Though others might ague that if the project was teacher-designed it would be more benifital to the student, we fixed that by giving the teachers a say in the project by having them pick out project ideas while the rest of the project was in the hands of the student. All in all the projects should be student-designed to give them motivation and advancement.",

    essay: "Imagine you are in the middle of a wonderful summer break. When suddenly, you received an email; you opened it, and it happens to be from your teacher. There it is, your summer assignment; after glancing through the rubric document, you let out a big sigh. The requirements and tasks on the rubric were super complex, and it does not interest you whatsoever. You thought to yourself that if this summer project was to be a student-based assignment, then you would enjoy it a lot more. Thus, this lead me to believe that summer projects should be student-designed because it expands students' creativity, give students motivation, and students will have a more likely chance to succeed.\n \n Student-designed projects give students a sense of creativity. Students will be able to express themselves, and show their teacher their fullest potential. Student-designed projects allow students to be more creative through learning by thinking outside of the box. This is because students will have the freedom to go above and beyond their limits, due to the fact that there won't be any certain requirements. Students can also be themselves, and create a final product that meets their teachers' standards. Without realizing it, students can end up creating a masterpiece that they would never have thought they'd be able to create before.\n \n Not only will student-designed projects give students a sense of creativity, but it also give students more motivation. According to\n \n The National Education of Youth Institution , a student stated that he was completely stressed while completing his assignment, which was teacher-designed. Since he did not know what to do for his summer project, this gave him lots of anxiety and stress. This shows that teacher-designed projects will not benefit students, but rather do more harm to the students' health. However with student-based projects, students tend to be more motivated and dedicated to completing their work; as a result, this will provide a positive atmosphere and mindset for students. Motivation is an important concept in learning because it is what strives students to go above and beyond. By having the motivation to complete the assignment, students will have more interest in their activity, and will enjoy it more.\n \n Furthermore, students will have a more likely chance to succeed. Student-based projects will ultimately benefit students because they will be more confident in obtaining a good grade, due to them originally creating the project with their own ideas. A study at Harvard University shows that 86% of students received above an 80%, a B letter grade, on their graded student-designed summer projects. After looking at the statistic, we can conclude that students whom had the opportunity to complete a student-designed assignment, were more likely to succeed and earn a decent grade.\n \n To summarize the totality of the argument, students will have a more beneficial and practical effect when completing a student-designed project rather than a teacher-designed project. Summer assignments should be student-designed because it gives students a sense of creativity, motivate students to do their best, and more students will succeed in the end. Student-designed projects will not only have a big impact on the future of education, but on the students as a whole.Â",

    essay: "No student enjoys doing schoolwork over the summer, furthermore, if the project required these students to design the project themselves, even less of them would end up completing it. Teacher-designed summer projects are preferable because they require the students to do less work, they're easier to grade for the teacher, and some students don't have the necessary materials at home for a student-designed project.\n \n On summer vacation school is the last thing that is on the minds of the majority of students, therefore, a student-designed summer project isn't ideal. Many of the smaller summer projects, such as simply reading a book, don't get completed despite being relatively easier in comparison to much of the work done during the school year.\n \n A student-designed project would require extra planning and more time devotion that many people wouldn't be willing to give. However, a project of the teachers design would take much less time to complete and the result would be more students actually finishing the assignment.\n \n Every teacher has multiple periods of students to teach. If even only half of the class each period turned in a summer project of their design, it would be a nightmare for the teacher to grade. A grading rubric would be rendered useless because every student turned in their own unique project from the topic of their choosing. This could cause unfairness in the grades given to these students because it would be up to the teacher's potentially biased opinion to decide what grades the projects deserve. If the project was entirely created by the teacher, on the other hand, a uniform grading rubric could be created and ensure that each student recieves a fair grade in accordance with the rubric. This is also beneficial to the students because having a rubric lets them know what they're being graded on and can help them plan out how they're going to complete the assignment.\n \n For the people who don't have wifi or a computer at home, a project they have to design themselves would be a hard task to complete. For starters, students without access to a computer or wifi at home likely aren't going to even know about the project because they were unable to check Google Classroom, Blackboard, or wherever else the project wouldv'e been posted. If they do manage to find out about the project, it would still require the students to go to a public library or a friends house where they can access the internet. This is a hassle that would cause a majority of these students to simply not do the project.\n \n Some people might claim that student-designed projects are better because it allows them to express themselves and their interests through their projects. Sadly, this is invalid because no students truly express themselves through a school project. They do it through things they love like sports, clothes, music, and art. Therefore, there isn't any point in allowing the students to design the project themselves.\n \n A student-desinged project is inferior to one of the teachers design because it takes a larger time commitment, is harder for the teacher to grade, and requires materials that not every student has access to. In conclusion, a summer project is going to be boring to complete anyways, so it may as well be easier for the students and the teacher and not require the students to do more work.",

    essay: "Do you believe projects in the summer be teacher designed or studentÂ designed? Well from my point of view, as a junior at Generic_School. I feel like all summer projects should be designedÂ by a teacher if you wanna boost their learning through the break. One way you can prove that is, when a teacher may teach you information that you never heard of before. Unlike having to something you already know.\n \n First for instance, if your teacher gives you a project it can be beneficial many ways. You may be learning something that you haven't learned before, and could be learning it in one of your subjects when you get back to school, so when you learn about that topic in a period you would be ready, cause you was provided with information you learned during the summer that teacher taught you. Also, some students prefer being given directional instructions while during an assignment. It helps them because everything is there for them because the teacher them with instructions to complete the project.\n \n However, they're some ways kids benefit from having their own designed project. This includes,kids or teens may not have financial they need for the projects teachers instruct them during the summer.\n \n Also, when they come back to school during the summer they can teach one another something new during things like presentations and etc. Another reason why student should design their summer project, is because students may not feel confront ableÂ with the project the teacher assigned them, and are more likely to do better with something they already know.\n \n So through all these details, what do you believe should students design their own projects during the summer or should the teachers design them. Like said teachers provide some students with information they never heard or ever learned. And you may be informed with information you may be leaning in the next school year.",

    essay: "Should students design a summer project for school? Yes students should design the summer project. Plenty of students would get their projects done; it'll be better understanding and easier on the students. I believe the summer project should be designed by the students because the students are going to be able to choose what is going to helped them over the break with their summer projects like making it fun to do maybe with friends, family members, or anything to get your summer projects done.\n \n More students would turn in the summer projects. From school experiences when students come back from their summer break plenty of students don't have their summer projects because students don't like the books they have to choose from. The project should be fun for students its their summer break it should be fun and about things they like and turn it an essay about what they did over the summer. The summer project should be designed by students so more students could turn in their projects when they arrive back to school from their break.\n \n Students would be interested in doing them if they were designed by the students. If the project would be student designed it would be much easier for students because the student will have to find something that interested in and what they like and also it would make it much better because the students would have to talk about a couple things that helped them with doing the summer project. Summer projects should be a little fun, better than the way a teacher would design the summer project. Students could make it creative and fun it doesn't have to be boring. Students like to do fun things with school not always just doing work that's boring.\n \n It would help if getting a couple students from different grade levels to talk about the summer project. The students would talk about what is going to be needed for the project. Students are going to agree and disagree about what they dont like about the way the teacher designed the summer projects and turn it into somethings students like and an easier and fun way for students to do their summer projects. Getting experiences from other students on what they like and don't about the teacher way of designing the project is helpful, so the students know what they should be looking for when designing the project for students.\n \n I believe that the students should design the summer project in a fun and creative way instead of reading books and telling things about the book, therefore more students can get them done. I could see why it should be teacher designed because teachers know exactly what their looking towards when trying to help students see their problems in certain areas, but students understand things more when it's coming from experience.Â",

    essay: "Doing projects over the summer can be a hassle and most of the time student dont want to do the work. Most of the time the teacher gives everyone a project to do ,designed by her, but what if instead the were student-designed. This would encourage students to do their work, let them make their own decisions, and showed their teacher what they really know and shows how creative they are .\n \n When someone tells kids to do something most of the time they dont really wanna do it,especially when it comes to school work when they are out of school. But letting students design their own projects encourages them to want to do it more because it's their own idea. This will make it easier for the student to complete their project because it is something they enjoy talking about .When they are having fun doing the project thats when things are done the best.\n \n When making your own decisions you can make a plan for how you want it done and what you are going to do for it. This promotes students making their own decisions on what they want their project to be about and how they will design it. It also, help students in early decision making with what the topic will be on and how they can put the most information in the project. Also ,if they have more then one idea they have to decide which is the best to do it on. They also have the decision of when they want to do it during the summer and a guessÂ of how long it will take them.\n \n If student designed projects it would let them be creative and show their true potential. Student would have to show their creativity while designing what it will look like and how they want it to be presenting it after summer is over. They will have to show their creativity with how neat and the colors they use. Also, staying on topic with the theme and not getting distracted in other things. This will also show how hard they worked on it and the effort put in it.\n \n In conclusion students should be allowed to design their project for over the summer because it will encourage them to do their work, help them with decision making, and let them be creative. This will help on independence as well as many other life skills they may need in the future. Choosing their projects are just the beginning of a long life of decision making.",

    essay: "As I sit in a room surrounded by other teenagers, I contemplate the effectiveness of summer projects designed by these students. Most of them would create a meaningless project that took minimal time to create, and even less to complete. And although many student projects would probably be more fun than ones created by a teacher, they would miss the purpose of summer projects- to prepare the student for the coming year's courses.\n \n The majority of students do not enjoy having summer projects. Because of this, if students were allowed to design their own projects for the summer, they would create easy projects for themselves in order to complete as little work as possible over the summer. While most students would be happier doing a student-designed project, few would actually be willing to put in the time and effort to design a good project, leading to a summer filled with pointless work that fails to stimulate the student's mind and prepare them for their classes in the fall.\n \n A major problem with student-designed projects is the students' lack of knowledge about the coursework they will be studying in the next year. Although a student project may be fun, it is unlikely to adequately prepare the students for their classes. The purpose of summer projects are to prepare the student for the next year's work; the teacher knows what will be studied and is therefore better able to prepare material for the summer. Teachers are also more aware of how much time it takes for students to complete a project and therefore will create a project better suited for the time over the summer.\n \n Teachers are expected to create quality projects for their students to complete, which are not full of busy work with no real meaning. Because teachers are both paid to design and teach curriculum to students, and enjoy the subject they teach, they are more likely to put time and effort into creating a meaningful summer project. Students, on the other hand, often do not share the teacher's passion for their subject, and have no motive for designing a good project. If a student's passion is math, but they have been told to design a summer project to prepare for the next year's English class, they are less likely to spend time on the project, because they do not enjoy it and have no interest in pursuing a career in English.\n \n If students were to design their own summer projects, this would mean that each year there would be new projects. New projects each year would create non-uniform summer learning, meaning that each year of students would enter their new classes with widely varying knowledge from the summer. This ends up being harder on the teacher, who has no way of knowing if the students are prepared to begin class, and may cut into learning time if the teacher is required to review what was supposed to have been learned over the summer because the students did not adequately cover the material for the summer when they designed their projects.\n \n The best option for creating summer projects is to have the teachers design projects for their incoming students to complete the summer prior to taking the teacher's class. Although student projects would be fun and easy, they miss the point of doing summer projects and would end up as extra busy-work for students to complete, rather than a meaningful assignment meant to prepare them for the year ahead.

    essay: "Summer is a time that both students and teachers tend to enjoy. It gives the students a chance to relax, and not worry about things such as homework, projects, quizzes, and tests. The teachers also get a chance to take a break from grading and assigning work. Yet, if students still had to do a summer project in order to keep learning over the summer, it should be student-designed because students tend to be busier over the summer with many different things, and the project should cater to their schedule.\n \n During the school year, most students are very busy with school work, along with different activities such as jobs, sports, and school clubs. For the most students, summer is the only opportunity that they have to relax, or spend time with family and friends. Vacations and family events are usually panned to take place during the summer. And a school project could interfere with that precious time. The student should be the one to design the project in order for it to be flexible to their schedule.\n \n Students designing their on projects would also be a great opportunity for teachers to get a break. Many teachers tend to spend hours on end coming up with lesson plans and grading work. Although teachers would still have to grade the project, the student would be taking a small work load off of the teacher by designing the summer project themselves, And, it could possibly educate the teacher on a different subject.\n \n Giving students the benefit of designing the summer project could also let them be more creative =, and enjoy the task at hand. Most of the time when students have to do projects, it is based off of a subject that is being taught in school: Such as math, history, and science. Letting students be more creative could also allow them to integrate their summer project into their summer schedule. Such as calculating the total amount of hours they have worked, doing historic research on the family vacation spot, or counting how many steps was taken during a hike.\n \n Some may argue that students would not be responsible enough to plan and execute the summer project. Though, there are students who do not do the appropriate amount of work throughout the school year, many students already handle great responsibilities in their life; such as babysitting a younger sibling, sports practices, and having a job to not only support themselves, but their families too.\n \n As previously stated, summer is usually an important time for both students and teachers. Rather they use it to participate in activities, or family events. Or, relax and take a break from school and work. At the end of the day, a student's education is important to maintain. But, so is their time and schedules. That is why students should be the ones to design their own summer project. Along with the fact that it would lighten up a teachers work load so they as well could enjoy their time off.",

    essay: "Should schools require students to do summer projects? Well I agree with this topic because, some students would want to require better learning experiences that would help them figure out ideas in the future to come; but instead of letting teachers decide we as students should be able to come up with ideas that would fit in with our learning pace. As students we would have more time to figure out everything we need in order to make a good project. Student decisions is made for a summer project.\n \n As students we can talk about what we have learned in class or even at home. Making a project about nature is something you can create for your science class next school year. We would be able to show off our skills as a team in order to let the true leadership come out of everyone. We should be able to partner up with someone that is determined to learn. Doing a summer project on something you done in class would help the most because mainly we already know what we have worked on; but instead of copying basically what you know you be creative. Working as a team isnt easy or hard it will come to you if only we put our minds into it.\n \n Some schools have teachers that want students to better themselves for a purpose. Teachers are settings students up for if there going to college. College isnt made for everyone, some colleges give projects that have to be turned in at a certain point of time. Like writing essays or doing group activity projects. While your in school teachers want you to better yourselves to be someone that you want to be in life. You dont necessarily have to have an poster project, teachers can give you projects that doesnt deal with school it'll just better our community. Projects arent always on paper it can be something else if you or the teacher ant it to be.\n \n Being able to learn during a summer break is hard, because we as children would probably have something to do, like family trips, field trips, and etc.. But if learning is something that is accomplished on its own. We can come up with projects on our own, we can be out of state and take pictures of something that fascinates us and than we could put it on a poster, or even a presentation. Being able to come to school from summer break starting a whole new year, you could talk about the amazing things you saw in a sideshow. Not knowing that we are doing a project basically everyday, it's basically life. Projects can come in many forms, but being able to do them as a team would make it more fun for school and the summer.\n \n While teachers teach and students learn, students should be able to learn on there own at some point. Teacher dont always have to give us work on there topic we should be able to come up with some good ideas that'll be creative in the learning environment. This is why I agree with students should be able to make there own decisions.",

    essay: "Have you ever had an project over the summer, and you thought what If this was student designed ? Well I defer, I truly believe that if summer projects were ran by students it will be a major mishap. There are many reasons why summer projects should not be students designed. First, because many students are not going to forget about the academic part of the project. Also many students will not set an time frame on when and how to complete these projects. Then students would not know what strategiesÂ to remember or to use to study over their summer break. For example over the summer I had to read the maximum of six books over the summer, but I could never finish or complete my goal because I would most likely forget about reading over the summer, and I would forget what strategies to use to help me complete my goal. Finally, this why I'm siding with all projects should be teacher designed.\n \n To begin, many students believe that summer break is not to really focus on the time frame that they have to learn or set their minds on nothing pertaining to school work or anything work academic. This is an reason why projects should not be designed by students, and I feel that teachers are going to give students strategies that pertain to what the students have learned during school hours. Also I know that teachers will give students an time frame that will allow students to complete projects, and help students focus on learning during break. I learned that many reasons why I could not complete my math goal during the summer. This was because I was not setting an time frame for myself to keep track and making sure I can reach my goal, also I would very so often forget my strategies that i used during school hours to help guide me. Next, this is why projects should be designed by teachers. I know that teachers would give us many things that will help us remember, and focus such as: notes work assignments that we have done during school hours, and also an time frame of when It can be completed.\n \n Next, teachers providing projects I felt It would be more easier on students because students need an extra boost over the summer mainly most students would feel that they might not remember, or cant retain the information and can not complete. If teachers where to design projects for students,I know that teachers will have an due date on when and how to turn in your projects on time. This suggestion is really good for students, because If students made projects that they wouldn't know how to turn in projects, or when to finish them. My teacher makes sure her students are completing and finishing projects on this website called Schoolagly. This process is to make sure that any projects or work assignments are turned in and done correctly, And also with this process teachers can add notes and definitions that will help with projects and work assignments. To become more perplexÂ on this topic this is the reason why students should not design summer projects,and because sometimes student wouldn't know when to complete or finish these projects.\n \n Finally, there are many reasons to why summer projects should be made by teachers and not students. These reasons are based on the needs for students, and how some students need an teachers to help them concentrate on projects during the summer. Also so students need help from teachers to manage time frame on when to complete projects. Then students might need help from teachers on how to retain the information learned during school hours. But if it were up to most students they would look at it in a different perspective a lotÂ of time students would want to design projects, because they believe that they have all of their materials that they will need for projects and sometimes they don't which makes it hard. Also this makes it complicated for students to make and time frame on when to finish the project,also some may need assistance with remembering what strategies they used to remember during school hours. To sum It up, I truly believe this is why teachers should make all summer projects to give students an helpful pathÂ to continue learning.\n \n In conclusion, there are many reason why students should not design break projects. Many students are going to forget about the academic part of the projects. Also many students will not set an time frame on when and how to complete these projects. Then students would not know what strategiesÂ to remember or to use to study over the break. This concept is really important,and also helps make sure students using the break time for projects,and has an adult that has put material down to help along the way. Teachers creating projects will also help by not letting the students to get off course during break. Just think about it would you want your students, or child to have projects over the break and not have to proper structure for thier projects?",

    essay: "Some schools do require students to do projects over summer break, however i do think they should be student-designed. The students should design a project that they would be interested to do, but the teacher would have to revise the project to make sure its a project involving school. Also the teacher can see work that the students picked and chose to do, and the teacher could learn more about that student.\n \n The students project should be about something that interests them in their life. The teacher would still make sure its an appropriate topic to do, but for the most part the student should pick and choose what he or she will do. I remember in elementary school my teacher assigned a summer project called, \"All about me\". Even though she picked the topic to the project me and the rest of the students had to really put together the project because it was a personal project that was about ourselves. It was a fun project to do for the most part. I got to put all of my work on a poster board; i talked about my favorite hobby, sport, and color. I also talked about how many sibings i have and their names and ages. It was a good project to do over the summer because it wasn't too overwelming.\n \n A student-designed project lets the teacher know more about that person an how he or she does their work. Students would most likely pick a topic on something easy, but i dont think thats a issue. The students should pick something that they dont have to sit down and think too hard about. It's summer time they dont want to sit down to do a school project during the summer and have to stress about how they dont know how to do it and they just end up not doing it because it was too hard and overwelming. Everyone knows when they get frustrated when their doing something important they just want to give up because they feel like it wont be good enough. Thats how i feel when a teacher gives me work to do and i find it difficult and not interesting i just wanna give up and not do it.\n \n When students are on their summer break mostly everyone goes out of town or their working, so they dont really have a lot of time on their hands. The teacher should atleast let their students do the project in however form they want too as long as they complete the task, i dont think they should be counted out for how little the project is when its completed. As long as the student has all the right points on his or her project they should get a completion grade for even starting it over the summer break; the time where everyone should be relaxing and just having a good time, not doing a school project in the middle of summer break. Like who wants to be out at a resort somewhere for vacation and all of a sudden you remember you have a project that is a lot of points due right when you come back from break ,like thats a lot of stress. It would be so much easier to do a project you picked yourself because you would already know what your gonna put down on your project. You wouldnt have to think so hard on one task.\n \n All the schools that assign summer projects they should let the students pick and choose what they want to do it on, so they wont be stressed out when their supposed to be relaxing on their break from school. Students should want to do the project because its a easy grade and they know exactly what they will talk about. Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â",

    essay: "Summer break from schools has been a topic of consideration for a long time. Many people do not appreciate a summer break because they forget school material too easily throughout those few months of no school. Others say the break is beneficial due to the fact that students' minds are given a while to rest. Some schools have been combating the loss of knowledge over the summer by giving mandatory projects for students to complete over the summer. By doing this, they are assuring that the students do not forget too much and are still able to function well at the beginning of the next school year. The issue comes in on the differing ideas that these summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. In the schools that require summer projects, the projects should be student-designed.\n \n Schools have given summer breaks with the means of giving both teachers and students a rest. But due to such a large gap in between classes, students have often been observed to forget many things and therefore need lots of review at the beginning of school, which takes up lots of needed class time. If we spend lots of time reviewing at the beginning of each school year, the date for the end of school gets pushed farther into summer, therefore decreasing the amount of break. If students are given projects to design and complete over the summer, they will remember much more. Allowing students to design a project themselves gets them more involved with the material, thus causing them to learn more efficiently than in the classroom. When they are independent and outside of school, the willingness to complete a project would improve quite a bit, even if it is over their break. The end result of this would be that there would be less time taken up to review at the beginning of school, and new material would be presented much sooner, leading to an earlier end date for school, and, obviously, and longer summer break.\n \n With a mandatory summer project that is teacher-designed, the teacher gets even less of a break. Instead of looking forward to the end of school and a nice, long break from the patience-draining teenagers, they have to worry about creating projects for all their students. Since they are already so tremendously busy, heaping yet another material requirement on their head would be unfair. They already do so much more work than the students, so why not make the students create their own projects? Many of my teachers have talked about how over breaks (like winter and spring break) they did lots of grading and planning for when school starts back up. Seeing as how winter and spring breaks would be the only good times to work on a summer project, they would have to be designing a project on top of grading and planning. Consequently, the teachers become more stressed and burdened, all the while not receiving an increase in their salary. Student-designed projects would allow teachers to not be as stressed, and allow them to have more of a break than they otherwise would.\n \n Personally, I would enjoy having to design my own project for summer break. It would give me something more to do, and if it's designed by me, I would find it vastly more enjoyable than one created by the teacher. In my experience, I have quickly forgotten lots of school material in the span of summer break. Summer break is already a time in my life where I hardly do anything except a couple vacations and lounging around at home. If I had to design my project, my brain would be up and running and I would be finding much more to do. Instead of being sedentary, I could be furthering my knowledge in certain subjects so that I feel more prepared for the following school year. My imagination could also run more free than it normally does. Having to create something ourselves allows our minds to be more free and imaginative. Deep down, imagination is something we all crave, but it is suppressed quite often by requirements and rubrics. Minds young and old long to be free and not confined to what we are told we have to do or should do. Making us students design our own summer projects gives our minds wings and something to do.\n \n A summer project is a good idea, but whether or not it should be designed by the student or by the teacher is still under thought. The benefits of having student-designed projects far outweigh those of having teacher-designed projects. Letting students make their own project allows them to increase their consumption of knowledge of different subjects because they are not sitting in a classroom and being talked to by a teacher. They can do what they want with that subject, making it more enjoyable for them and allowing them to remember more, thus decreasing the need to review for a couple of weeks at the beginning of every school year. Another benefit is that teachers would not have to be worked even more. They are already worked hard for so little pay, so they should not have to worry about creating even more material for students. A student-designed project allows the freedom of imagination. Schools preach the idea that they want students to be free of mind, yet they still have a multitude of confines. Many of us also do not do much during summer break, and if we are able to create something that we would enjoy completing, we would be quite a bit more occupied during the summer. We would be excited to go back to school and share what we learned or did over the summer. For these reasons, student-designed summer projects would be a much more beneficial and accepted form of education over the break.",

    essay: "School summer projects is the thing that students most dread in the summer, apart from summer school of course. Most of the time they are big, boring packets filled with long and boring questions. Usually everyone waits until last minute to complete them because thinking about them during vacation ruins the fun. But with student design projects everythingÂ would be different. School summer projects should be student designed instead of teacher designed. It would help the students get interested in the projects and topics they are about to learn, it would help the teachers better cater to their students in their lessons and it would also help the students explore their creativity and critical thinking in school related assignments.\n \n A teacher's school summer projects is usually just a very thick packet with a lot of questions and a lot of work, they are no fun at all and students dread getting them. Most of the time this projects are not even projects, they're very thick packets with the words 'summer project' at the top in big bold letters.\n \n With students being able to create their own student projects they can cater to themselves this allows them to design the project around something they did during their summer vacation or about an experience they had. These projects should be about using creativity to design something fun that involves what the students are learning and what they're experiencing in the real world. Most of the summer projects are assigned for their class courses for their upcoming school year. Having something that relates their summer vacations and their classes makes the students exited about their courses and all that they can do with it. It demonstrates to the students what they can do in real life with what they are learning at school. Since the students don't know what their summer project is they are going to be thinking about it their whole summer, when they do something they are going to be thinking about how it relates to that subject and if that can be their project. With students learning at different in different ways this allows them to demonstrate what their way of learning is and whatÂ they are most comfortable with. for example for visual learners it could be a poster with big picture and little to none words, for someone who doesnt not learn with drawings it could be a question and answer type project. Student led projects allow students to design their own project is the best way to capture theirÂ attention and make them exited about school.\n \n Allowing students to create their own project would not only be beneficial to the students but also to the teachers. When looking at the projects it allows the teachers to get to know the students, as in every project there will be a part of the students in them. Even though teachers try to it's hard to relate to all of their students. Student designed projects allows the teachers to learn about what type of learners their students are, whether they are visual learners or something else it teaches them about how they can better reach their students and not loose their interest during the school year. This will also help the teachers when making their student plans, when they look at the project they will be able to see what part of the course the students are most exited about learning, what part they have already mastered and what part what part the student seem more confused about. With this information teachers can better creates their teaching plans and better cater to their students and their needs. When making teaching plans it is very important to mold it to the individual because not everyone learns the same way, and this project will help. Catering to each students learning pace and design helps them learn and be successful in their test and their futureÂ in those classes.\n \n Permitting the students to deign their own projects also helps with creativity. In school everything is very structures, it help the students function better and have a more organized school, which is good. Having said this, having structure does not allow students to explore their creativity and their critical thinking all in one, with school related assignments. Creativity is a veryÂ important part of learning and if students are not allowed to express themselves once in a while they get bored and loose interest in the subject or in school all together. When students are allowed to design their own project they are able to explore their creativity in school assignments. Allowing them to design their own project allows them to express themselves in a way where critical thinking is essential to completing the task. Creativity and critical thinking are essential pieces to be successful in the real world and in professional settings.\n \n When giving summer assignment teachers are expecting student to have fun and to keep learning during their summer vacation, but are students expected to have fun doing the assignments if teachers dont put anything fun in them. When assignments are not fun students loose interest and don't want to even think about completing the assignment. Students should be able to create their own assignment. Having student designed summer assignmentsÂ would be beneficial to students and teachers. It would help o the students explore a new way of thinking about assignments, it would also help them explore their creativityÂ and critical thinking all together, and it would also help teachers when planning their lessons to help find the best way for students to learn.Â",

    essay: "Imagine having to do a summer project over a topic you don't like. Some schools have decided to do this with their students in order for them to still learn while they are on summer break. Although the teacher can make sure you have a topic that you have learned about, the students should design the project. The project should be student designed because they can chose how they want to do the project, they don't have to worry about not knowing the topics, and can be a topic that they like or enjoy.\n \n Firstly, the students can chose how they want to do their project. For example, they could chose how they would want to present their project. Either by choosing to have a report or a presentation to show the class. Another example is they might want to have a group project. The more hands they have the more creative they can make the assignment. Both of these examples show that choosing how they do their project helps them feel comfortable.\n \n Next, they wouldn't have to worry about not knowing the topic if they get to chose. For example, if their picking topics they would chose one that they remember. The students wouldn't pick a topic they didn't understand or remember for their assignment. Another example is that they could pick one that fascinates them. Like for a science project they could pick a marine wildlife topic, if thats what they find entertaining, or for English class they could pick one of their favorite authors or books. These examples represent the fact that if they were to pick their topics it will allow them to be engrossed with it.\n \n Lastly, this project could be something they like or enjoy. Like in my first example having a group project can make it more enjoyable. Because their in a group they could have friends working alongside them making it more fun. This project is where they might be able to let their creative side take control. Students would want the work to be colorful and interesting. Both having friends and being creative let the kids have a fun and enjoyable time doing their project.\n \n In conclusion, the students should design their own summer project because they can chose how they want to do the project, don't have to worry about not knowing the project, and can be something they like or enjoy. Would you let your teacher design your project?",

    essay: "Assigned schoolwork during summer break has been a widely debated matter for years. For both supporters and opposers of schoolwork being assigned during summer break begs a crucial question: Should summer projects be student-designed or teacher-designed? Although assumptions may lead many to state that teachers, who hold the experience, should deisgn these projects, it is more beneficial for students to design the projects themselves. There are many misconceptions regarding the mentality and intuition of students; it is very likely that student-designed projects can prepare them for large programs and/or assignments, such as the Personal Project. In addition, it may also relieve teachers of excess work.\n \n An increasingly common assumption is that pscyhological intuition, and creativity in some aspects, increases with age, thus students are less capable of designing a project, or most things for that matter, than adults. Several people argue that students may lack maturity, but various pscyhologists, notably Generic_Name, have disproved the claim, finding no evidence of maturity being linked to one's intuition or strive of creativity. In fact, this myth actually arose due to various reforms of the Progressive Era restricting children and immigrants' personal freedom, which continues to this day. Although many would deem this irrelevant, it is precisely the reason that we must not hold back to provide students with freedom in creating their own projects and avoid persisting a key issue.\n \n Adding to that, and perhaps one of the most common arguments against teacher-designed projects, is the statement that students are not exposed to projects that require overarching critical thinking. Research conducted by various universities, such as the University of Chicago, has shown that students are not prepared for upcoming projects every time they complete a teacher-designed project; for example, a student completing a project that provides them with a template, deadline, and requirements may not actually affect them to the extent that many people assume, as the student simply searches for information rather than being properly invested and analyzing the information they have, as they would be much more likely of doing in a student-designed project. This is not simple speculation; counties in New York and Massachusetts, even with their massive demographic, cultural, and ideological differences, have both reported increased success in student-led projects after beginning their student-designed summer projects curriculum.\n \n Despite the aforementioned standpoints, there is no doubt that teachers are very important figures in society, and they should never be taken for granted and must be treated with absolute respect. Unfortunately, a large domestic issue in the United States is the amount of appeal of having a teacher career. Unlike in countries such as South Korea, American citizens stereotype teaching with negative assumptions/statements. Although that is another discussion in itself, it still has a strong tie to teachers being overworked, in some regions more than others, but it should not be downplayed nontheless. In many states. summer break is one of the only periods of time that teachers can be truly relieved of work, and that time should be maximized by reducing their tasks; if there is going to be schoolwork done during the summer, it is at the very least a moral ideal to relieve teachers of doing unnecessary work that could be easily handed to students.\n \n Simply put, very few communities should expect to carry out teacher-designed summer projects with pleasing results. As promising as it may seem, it is apparent that teachers should not be given excess loads of responsibility of their students, and it is time to allow the students to take their own approaches to their tasks and prepare them for what is to come. It is not a perfect idea, as no idea can be, but everyone must take steps to reach their end, even if it is gradual. If we are to see to the success of more students and further cememt the well-being of our educators, this is a crucial step that should be taken.Â  Â Â Â",

    essay: "Some schools require students to complete summer projects during their break to assure that they are continuing to learn even when they are not in school. It is debated whether or not these projects should be student designed or teacher designed, and I believe that summer projects should be student designed. Students may want to design their project about something that they are passionate about, something they wish to learn more about, and perhaps they may be more accepting of doing summer projects if they got to design the projects they complete. It is hard for teachers to plan and design projects for each individual student because he or she may not choose a project that the student would want to complete and then a negative attitude develops towards summer projects. It is important for students to continue their education throughout the summer break but it needs to be something that they are interested in and something that they wish to learn about. Teachers get to plan all of their activities and projects throughout the school year and students have no say about what they wish to learn about or a project they wish to complete. Summer projects are the perfect opportunity to allow the student to choose a project that is interesting to them and that they have a passion for.\n \n If students were allowed to design their summer projects, they woud be more passionate towards it and be excited to complete it. Most summer projects that teachers design for students lack adventure and are the same boring projects they receive during school. Teachers design projects for their students all school year long and students do not wish to continue doing those same boring projects during the summer. If a student was able to design his or her project they would design it based on their interests and something that they are passionate about and that would result in an amazing project that shows heart and passion. A teacher rarely is going to plan a project that applies to each student's interest and instead just plans a project that is mundane that no student wishes to complete. Perhaps a student was passionate about art, they could easily take a trip to an art museum and design a poster or a slideshow about what they experienced at the art museum and then share their passion with other students in the classroom. Learning does not always have to be completing work in a textbook or doing a book report, it can be fun and exciting and something students have a passion for. If students were allowed to choose summer projects, it could result in more students being passionate about learning and some really amazing projects.\n \n A student designed project could be something that the student wishes to learn about as well. If a student showed an interest in marine biology, he or she could take trips to an aquarium and construct a project about what he or she learned. It is difficult for teachers to know all of their students interests and what they would like to learn about and that problem could be solved quickly by letting the students design their project. If a student does not want to learn about the project that a teacher has designed for them, summer projects become a negative thing and no student wishes to complete them. However, if a student designs a project around what he or she would like to learn about, it sparks a level of interest that may not be reached if a teacher were to design the project. Most of the kids in school are learning the basics, math, reading, writing, science, and so forth. While some of these subjects may interest students some may be more interested in the human anatomy, marine life, and the study of different cultures and if a student could design their summer project they could travel and witness different cultures and their history, or travel to a beach or nearby river with countless number of wildlife. They could truly experience it first hand which is a better form of learning than anyone could receive in a classroom.\n \n Also, students may be more open to completing a summer project if they were the ones to design it. Of course it would have to meet guidelines, but at least it would be catered to the student. When I was younger I was assigned summer projects and I dreaded them every year because they were mainly huge, thick packets of math problems. I had no interest in completing these summer projects and eventually I quit doing them. However, if I were able to design my project I would have made it fun and educational at the same time and I would have been more open to completing it. One summer my aunt took my cousins and I to the science museum and we had a wonderful time but we also got to learn a lot as well. I was about eleven years old when I took this trip and I will never forget all of the amazing things I learned as well as how much fun I had. Learning does not have to be strictly confined to completing packets all summer, it can be broader and more fun. If students could design a summer project that suits them and is fun and interesting, they would be more open to completing it.\n \n In conclusion, students should be able to design their summer projects because, there will be more passion towards the project, it could be about something they may not be able to learn about in the classroom, and they would be less negative about completing it. Teachers do not know each and every student's interest or what they wish to learn about so it is difficult for them to design a project that is fun for every student so they end up giving out mundane packets every year. It is important to allow students to choose what they would like to learn about and further their education in during the summer because teachers choose what they learn about during school. It should be their opportunity during the summer to explore the horizon and further their education by doing a project they wish to do and that starts with letting them design their project.",

    essay: "Some schools have summer projects so students will keep learning during the break. These projects should be student-designed. The one of the reasons for this is because if a student makes them, they will choose something they enjoy and will also enjoy the work. Summer break is a time when your supposed to enjoy your time off so shouldn't the projects you have to do be the same? That being said, let's say... A teacher assigns a ten page essay to do over the break. No one would want to do that. If a student was making the project, they could make it into a fun project of some sorts. Like for example, a project to solar power your iPhone charger. They would still be learning but they could enjoy themselves while doing it. They might even do more projects than required because they are enjoying themselves.\n \n Eventually, you run out of things to and you get bored, designing your own project could be a fun distraction because you're not writing that ten paged essay. Students could learn while making their own project. While making the project, it could help learn important leadership skills, how to make good use of time, how to be independent, and could even help them get closer to their dreams. They are no ends to the possibilities of what kinds of projects. They could be research projects, experiments, keeping a journal and so much more. The student could cater to their interest and goals so they aren't just doing more schoolwork that might not help them achieve their goal or get where they want or need to be.\n \n If they're projects can help students reach their goals, then as teachers, whose jobs are to help students, they should be able to make their own projects. Teachers can even set a minimum of how much they need to do. We don't have to leave it all the to students if your not comfortable with that. The teachers still need to grade those projects. But they should still be student-designed, teachers can just help guide students like their supposed to. Teachers jobs are to guide students and the best way for them to help them is to let them make their own projects. Like it was said before, students can gain new and helpful skills they can use in the workplace.\n \n People have to make projects all the time for their jobs, so why not start early so they can figure out what works for them and what doesn't. It would save them a lot of heartache in the future and that's what we want... To prepare students for the future. That's exactly why I think summer projects should be student-designed.",

If students did their own projects some of them might be a good project while others students projects looks like they didn't try at all. Teachers should come up with summer projects because it is more organized for the students to do, easier for the teacher to grade, and it motivates every student to try and put in effort in their projects.\n \n Teachers should assign summer projects because it would be more organized. Many students that I know hardly put in any work writing their own essays in school even when they can write about whatever they want to. Some students don't know how to write a essay or how to even come up with the structure of one so how do people expect students to come up with their own personal summer project. Some students, however, are very creative in coming up with certain project ideas and are able to create or finish a essay easily. Not all students are like this. A lotÂ of students need to be told what to do for a project because they aren't that creative in coming up with ideas for projects and need help.\n \n Assigning summer projects by teachers make it easier for them to grade the project. Teachers usually have a hard time grading essays already even when they assign a certain book that the students are suppose to read. It makes their job twice as harder if the students were allowed to make their own project because its all different topics rather then 1 topic. Some teachers are really good though at grading peoples assignments and know some of the facts students projects. Most teachers, however, are not like this at all and they find it easier for them to just assign one topic for the student to make a project about so that it is easier to grade.\n \n Students lack motivation in doing schoolwork, especially projects. Some students that I have meet could care less about projects even if they have the choice to come up with their own ideas. They see projects as a pointless thing because they are already doing bad at school and the feel like its not gonna help their grade so what's the point. Some students are more motivated in trying to get their grades up and if they were able to make their own projects they would feel more motivated to get better grades. However, not all students think the same way and would rather feel more motivated if teachers handed out the topics for projects rather then make their own project.\n \n Summer projects should be assigned by teachers rather then students make their own summer project. It makes everything easier for both the student and the teacher. It also allow students to easily research the topic so that they can enjoy their summer rather then worry about it all summer.

Classes should be challenged to design their own project, this will challenge the student to design a complex project that is guaranteed to stay a topic of interest. Students should poses a checklist that details what the project needs. Teachers can provide examples for the class to reference if they become puzzled on a part of their task. Upon completion the teacher would receive an email verifying that the student finished the task.\n \n Say if the project is for history the teacher can choose the time period they want and the student will find a topic. For example the teacher wants the project to be in the 2000's, the student could then choose to write about wars in the Middle-East. Therefore the topic is relevant to what the teacher wants and the student is interested in his or her research. The person working on the task can write about why the war happened, who started the war, and when the war ended. After the student finishes, the work will be emailed to the history teacher and would be graded.\n \n If a teacher dictated the project the student would not have much interest in the work. The student would lose interest and stop working on it or would score low on the work. Loss of interest may result in the student not learning anything over summer. If someone holds interest in a subject they will retain the information they researched, and can possible continue to understand and research that object or subject.

Well if a student controlled their work they would be able to let their imagination flow, allowing them to discover their personality and learn about how they think and work best. The student would most likely choose something they want to learn more about. They can also choose something that appeals to their interests. For someone to learn something they must choose what appeals to them and build knowledge through research.

Schools say it benefits the student and expands their knowledge. Schools should let the students choose and design their project.

    essay: "Summer projects are beneficial in allowing students to continue learning throughout their summer break. By working on a short essay or PowerPoint over this three month span can allow students to achieve their goals in understanding a certain subject better. However, the debate about these projects is if they should be teacher-designed or student-designed. While some may believe that teachers know more about learning than students, I believe that these projects should be student designed in order to make them more enjoyable to the students, help the students individually, and give the students a break from the typical classroom norms.\n \n First, making these summer projects student-designed would make them more enjoyable to the students. Students know what they enjoy doing and what they do not like. At first, summer projects may sound like a hassle for students, but if they design an exciting project, they may be excited to start it and turn it in for grading. For example, when I was in the eighth grade, my English teacher assigned us a long list of vocabulary to do over the summer. My classmates and I were all dreading the 100 vocabulary words that we had to define by ourselves. However, if we were allowed to put our own spin on it and create a PowerPoint or hands-on project, then we may have been more motivated to learn the vocabulary words and retain the information in a more beneficial way.\n \n Also, the students know what subjects they struggle to learn in. Some students have trouble in math or science, while others struggle with reading or history. By allowing the students to create a summer project that focuses directly on a subject that the student knows they need help with would be more beneficial than just a random assignment that the teacher chooses for everyone. For example, I struggle with history, so when I fall behind in class, I ask my teacher for help and he will assign me extra credit work that is based on the topic that I am struggling with. This extra credit benefits me more than just a worksheet or a quiz and I begin to actually understand the topic.\n \n Moreover, these student-designed projects would also give the students a break from the typical classroom norms. During the school year, teachers will assign worksheets or packets of information that is used one time in the class and then never thought of again. They also use tests and quizzes to store information in the students head for a short period of time. By allowing the students to create a project that they would enjoy and is proctored to their specific learning style, could motivate the students to learn and retain the information better than they would in a typical class.\n \n Therefore, the student-designed summer projects are the best solution to keep the kids learning, but also not overwhelm them with work. Allowing the students to create a project that they would throughly enjoy doing is not only beneficial to their learning, but also their attitude towards the school. Creating a project on a particular subject that they know they struggle with could motivate them to do better and help them develop a passion for learning. Also, swaying away from the usual learning styles that are shown in the classroom can also give the students a break while also allowing them to continue learning. Although teachers know what to teach and how to teach, the students have to have a passion for learning before they can retain any information and student-designed summer projects are the best solution.",

    essay: "The summer before the upcoming school year, many schools require students to do a summer project. These projects are usually designed to make sure that the students are still learning over their break. When these projects are assigned, the teachers are in charge of what the project is going to be about. Most students feel as if they should decide what the project should be about. I believe that teachers should design summer projects because when the following school year comes along the project will go along with what they are about to learn, the students would be challenged, and it would be overall more beneficial to the students as a whole.\n \n When teachers design a project, it always has some sort of purpose behind it. Assigning these projects over the summer would allow students to have a start on the lesson before the school year starts. The students would have an idea of what they would be learning about the upcoming school year. With this advantage, teachers would use time in the classroom more effectively. This will also cause students to have the thought of school already in their mind.\n \n Another factor to look into when teachers design the summer projects, it would create a challenge for the students. If the students were in charge of designing a project, then they are most likely to pick something that doesn't require a lot of thought. As a teacher, their job is to generate the students' mind. Designing challenging projects would do just that. This would cause students to have the urge to learn more about the project. Also, when they get back to school they would have numerous questions about the project.\n \n Although some may say that if teacher-designed projects are implemented, then the students may not be interested. Simply because of the fact that it is not a topic they particularly want to learn about. While that may be true, ultimately it would be more beneficial the students if the teacher designed them. If the students creates the project, then they could possibly pick a topic that doesn't really benefit them in the future. When the teachers create the project, the students are more likely to get something out of the project.\n \n In closing, teachers should design the summer projects. This decision would benefit the students as whole. It would guarantee that the students are actually learning during the summer. Teachers wouldn't have to worry about students making a project that didn't require a lot of thinking. Also, it would cause teachers to not start a completely fresh lesson when the school year starts. The whole idea of summer projects is to continue learning outside the ten month school year, that can't happen if the students are in charge of the other two months.Â",

    essay: "I belive that these summer projects should be student designed rather than teacher designed. Students are able to work better if they get to design what their project should be about and have the chance to be more creative, they are also less likey to be stressed about doing it wrong. If these projects are teacher designed, students are limited to what they are capable of doing.\n \n When students get the chance to design and pick what they can learn about for their project, they will most likely pick something that they are pasionate about. Which means that they will most likey have more information about it and have the opportunity to be more creative on the finished product. For example, if a student wanted to to bulid a model about something they like, then they will work as hard as they can to complete it to the best of their abilities. It doesn't matter what topic they choose, all that matters is that they are using their time wisley and learing about something new or learning more about something they already knew.\n \n Having to do a project over the summer in general is stressful enough, so having a teacher get to design the kind of project students should do, would add even more stress. This stress could lead to students wanting to give up on the project and not complete it. Students are excited about summer because it means they won't have the stress of doing work for school, so if you design something that is easy and know a lot about, causes youto get it done quicker and enjoy the rest of your summer worry free.\n \n In my opinion, I think that is would be less stressful if I could get the chance to design my own project. I wouldn't have to worry about holding up to what a teacher expects me to do and only worry about what I know i can do.\n \n Concequently, if these projects are teacher designed, students are limited to what they are capable of doing. It limits their creativity and their work ethic. For instance, if student wanted to create a type of art work about what they learned about, they wouldn't be able to do that if a teacher got to choose the kind of design the student had to do. Students are expected to do their best and succeed, limiting them to do a specific project would only casue them to do the opposite. Students are capable of doing great things if you let them.\n \n In conclusion, students should have the opportunity to design their own project. Letting students design their own projects would only effect them in a positve way. It would cause them to do their very best and improve their creativity. They would be less stressed about doing what a teacher expects and get the project done much quicker. Students would have more time to enjoy their summer worry free. Teacher designed projects would only limit them to what they are actually capable of doing.Â",

    essay: "I along with other students, hate summer projects especially when a teacher designs it. As you can already tell i'm against teacher designed projects, and hereÂ isÂ why.\n \n When a teacher designs a summer project or any project in that matter it can be very uninteresting, which increases the chance that a student would just forget about the project or put in a low effort. Teachers these days give out more online work than paper, and anything online can be easily forgotten. Due to the fact that its online means that students would have to stay inside and not do what they've planned for the summer. Some students work efficiently if its on paper rather than a computer. What i'm trying to say here is that summer projects should not be designed by teachers.\n \n A big reason why students should be the designers is because that teachers lack something the fresh minds of young students have. That something is creativity, believe it or not creativity can get you far in life and it even makes school work a lot easier and fun. Doing anything in the same old fashioned traditional way can be tiresome and repetitive ,but doing work or anything can be a lot moreÂ enjoyable and easy if you think of a creative way to do it. There is no reason at all a student should not be able to complete a project they designed themselves.\n \n Now I know some people think teacher designed summer projects are more direct and easy to follow this is false because if you make the project you know all the steps and how to follow them.\n \n In conclusion students should be the ones designing summer projects not teachers.",

    essay: "Summer projects. The way schools assure that students continue learning during break. During summer, students often find themselves forgetting most of the material they had learned the previous year. A way to stop this from happeningÂ is to require students to complete a summer project. Alas, it is difficult to decide if the project should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Summer projects should be student-designed since it promotes creativity, invokes passion, and encourages students to be independent.\n \n A student-designed project promotes the students creativity. Generic_Name found himself wanting to be more creative after he finished his project. Promoting creativity in a project may spread more to a students daily life and strengthen their creativity. Since summer break is so long that the student's creativity could keep building. Generic_Name saw that he was able to solve problems quicker based on how creative he was. This can transfer over to other task the student may need to get done. Along with that it could make the summer project progress quicker than usual. Although a project does require creativity, it also needs some care.\n \n Allowing a student to design a project the way they like it, creates passion. Generic_Name like it when he can choose what he wants to do because he can do something he cares for.\n \n A Student that cares for a project will work on it more and one that dislikes their project. Summer break allows students to have a long amount of time to work on something they love, drastically improving the quality. Generic_Name had more pride in his work because he cared for it.\n \n Caring for the project and finish it can create a pride in the project and in ones self. Also, with the more time someone works on a project the more pride that person can get for finishing it. The benefit of a student-designed project can be good for the short term and long term.\n \n Projects that are student-designed encourages students to be independent. Generic_Name enjoyed his project since it gave him a taste of independence. Getting a sense of independence is good for teens since they are about to become young adults. Along with that, during summer break students can exercise that sense of independence by going out on their own. Generic_Name as so experienced with being independent that he had no problem when he moved out. Practicing independence can help with the future hardships students may face. An example of this is managing college and work. Student-designed projects can help in so many ways.\n \n Although, many feel that students would get off track of what the project is meant to do and not know want to do without structure but, this would just promote the ability to think for their own. Promoting Creativity with student-designed project would increase the creativity of the student it would help problem solving. Passion can be created, where they care and have pride for something, through a student-designed project. A student-designed project can encourage students to be independent, building experience and practice doing so. Just letting the students decide will help them.",

    essay: "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Should these summer projects be teacher designed or student designed? These summer projects should be teacher designed, because students may want to make simple projects without putting much effort into them. Students may not learn anything from their own projects, because they could just be copying and pasting from the internet. Teachers can also make a list telling the students what is required for the project, making the project more effective.\n \n Making the summer projects teacher designed would be better than making summer projects student designed, because students may want to make simple projects, without putting much effort into the work. For example, if Generic_Name were to work on a project, during his summer break, Generic_Name would probably rush and put random things on his project in order to say that he has done the work, because he may have other priority's, such as going outside and playing a sport or going to the swimming pool. For sure, tons of other students would do the same as Generic_Name. This means that making summer projects student designed wouldn't be the most brilliant idea. Making summer projects teacher designed means, teachers would want to see some fantastic work, instead of some junk that students would do.\n \n Students may not learn anything from their own projects, because they could just be copying and pasting information from the internet. That is plagirism, which is illegal to do and students can get into trouble for that and by the way, students are not learning. Therefore, summer projects being designed by teachers is a great idea, because teachers can assign the students ways to write, instead of copying and pasting, and teachers can make powerpoints of the instructions, that the students must follow. The way students can gain knowledge on what they've done is by reading reliable sites, based on the topics that the teacher has given them and summarizing what they have read and making sure it makes sense.\n \n Teacher's can make list's of the requirements that the students must follow for their projects, making the project spicy. For example, the teacher can require the students to write a certain amount of paragraphs in their own words, joined with pictures that relate to the students work, and even data that the student would have to collect, making students experts that they could even present their work to hundreds of people. This means students would have to put in time and effort to make sure they have learned something during their summer break, instead of just spending time on their phones, playing games, and not doing anything productive. Meaning that the requirements that the teachers give to the students is a huge role on how the students final product is going to look like.\n \n Therefore, schools requiring students to complete summer projects to assure learning during their break, should be teacher designed. This means that the teachers should create the way the summer project should be made. Students should take time out of their summer break to complete a project that is informing and can help them learn more. At last, summer projects should be teacher designed instead of student designed. Â Â Â Â",

    essay: "Why are summer projects student-designed instead of being teacher-designed? They are designed for students to learn about a specific subject that could teach them about a lot of things that they haven't heard about before doing the project. Student-designed summer projects represents new information, the amount of time it has been worked on, and the possibility of helping the society. Summer projects will help a student during their summer break to keep learning new things in the world and develop facts about them.\n \n Firstly, student-designed summer projects shows new information to students rather than a teacher. A teacher taught themselves to know the knowledge that a student would need in their future life, so making a project would increase the knowledge of a student. Projects during the summer break could actually help a student to remember everything that they learned and teach others about it to where people will learn new things in their life. When a student is able to give people details about what they learned during the summer, it would be added to the brain of the person to know what to do or how to do something. Information given from a student would stay in their mind for a long time to recollect, but a person will try to prove them wrong, so that they will get the point of the argument until the student is able to show the facts that they are the correct individual. Students collect facts of their subject and study them to show to the teacher of how much new information has helped them in knowing something they didn't know before working on the project.\n \n Secondly, student-designed summer projects shows the amount of time the student has been working on making the project. Timing of a project can represent how determined a student wants to learn about a new subject, so they could use all of the facts and put it into their project. If a student is taking days to weeks to finish the project they are going to make a spectacular presentation to the students and the teacher that will give them an extra boost in their knowledge. A student that takes only a day to work on their project wouldn't care about the facts they learn, even though it is important to learn everything that they need to learn to be smarter with facts that could come in their future. It shouldn't take a long time for a student to work on their project and not finish it in time to where they don't have the information, and it will show how irresponsible the student can be of not working on their project.\n \n The project should be filled with real information to where students can use it and transfer it to other students brain as they would have the possibility of taking a test or quiz on the information that was given to them. Testing or taking a quiz on a subject that the student have done a project on should be easy for all the students who learned a new fact.\n \n Thirdly, student-designed summer project helps society to do better and not make it worse to where it will become a deserted area or bad society. A summer project about helping society would influence people to care for their society to always clean it instead of trashing the area making it look dirty that no one wants to come near it and help people, so that nothing bad will happen to their society and no one will make it a bad area. Society creates a place to where Americans can be comfortable around each other having them to express their emotions publicly and getting the attention of people to care about them. It also creates a space to where people wouldn't like it based on the people that lives there having it to be seen as a bad society that no one who wants to live in a good society would consider to live or visit in that area. Americans can help society from becoming a bad society and a deserted area by taking care of the area and citizens who are in need of help before they make the society to be bad. If the society becomes to be not a good society everyone who lived there would leave and decide to live in a bigger area that has a better society.\n \n However, teacher-designed summer project will give the teacher the same information that they already knew before, but a student-designed summer project would actually teach the students new information of their subject during the summer. When a student is doing a project during the summer it would be intriguing to the students to keep learning and show everything they have in their brain to offer to other students improving their knowledge too. Teachers are able to learn the information as they study hard to give the students the same information, so a student should be able to do the same thing and achieve a better grade for their summer project. Student-designed summer projects can show their capability of getting the facts and information of their subject to where they would gain ideas on how to make their project connect to other students mindset on it.\n \n In Conclusion, summer projects are required to be student-designed to help students to learn new information and develop facts in the world. It teaches the students new information, the amount of time the project has to be done, and a way of helping their society to know in their future life. Summer projects are a good requirement for students to learn new things during their summer break.",

    essay: "Over summer, many students are required to do a project pertaining to a specific class. The projects given, should be teacher-designed rather than the student creating his or her own idea. The project should be teacher-designed because the project gives an outline to the student on what will be taught that school year. It also helps the student determine officially, if he or she would like to stay in that specific class and as well as, express to the teacher on the type of student he or she will be, based on the effort given on the summer project. If teachers continue to design the projects, there will be more success within the classroom and the work ethic given by students.\n \n When teachers give a summer assignment, the work given helps a student see the type of material he or she will be learning that year. The work comes to show how rigorous the class and classwork will be based off of the work load and in depth questions that the teacher has provided. With receiving an outline, it gives the overall idea of what to expect, so that the student can mentally prepare, for the upcoming year. When being able to prepare ahead of time, the student will be able to see the amount of work that might be given. Without the teacher-designed summer project, the student will be oblivious to what to expect in the class that they will be taking.\n \n Continuing on, a teacher-designed project, helps express to the teacher on the type of student he or she will be receiving, based off of the effort given on the project. When a teacher designs a project, it is usually a reflection of how hard that specific class is and type of teacher he or she might happen to be. If the student happens to only complete the bare minimum or does not even try, it shows that, that student may not be best suit in that teacher's class. With the teacher giving a personal designed project, it shows which students have the initiative and will work hard on any assignment given, moving forward. The project overall gives a central idea to the teacher, on what he or she needs to expect during the future of the school year.\n \n Many claim that not letting a student design their own project, takes away from his or her creativity and own personal ideas. However, the point of someone expressing creativity, is being able to take anything and make it their own. A student can still be creative and express themselves through the work given by the teacher. Having the ability to express his or her own ideas and meet the requirements, will stand out to any teacher evaluating it. Just because the range of ideas and creativity is limited when the student is not able to create his or her own project, does not mean creativity or personal ideas are completely shut out and prevented from being intertwined within the teacher's design.\n \n Overall, having a teacher-designed project is more efficient and much more beneficial than one that is student-designed. When having a project designed by a teacher, it is a way for a student to see how hard and rigorous the class will be and the abundance of work that will be given throughout the rest of the school year. Not only that, but it as well gives teachers the overall idea on what will be expected of specific students and the standards that will need to be upheld the upcoming year. Without the teacher-designed projects, the students will not know what to complete a project on and will not be ready at all, for what they will be learning the upcoming year. Teacher-designed projects are a great idea and will be a great addition, for all students to have the ability to be prepared, for the upcoming school year.Â  Â Â Â",
