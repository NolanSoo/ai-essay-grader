- This is the source code for my trials (using Source Dependent 8th grade - 3rd essay set) as that was the last thing tested.

- The "release-development" branch is for my work on an eventual release with the features I mentioned I wanted to add in the future in the Reflection slides, the video, and the interview (I will most likely mention it/or already have, depending on when you read this)
- Edit: "release-development" branch is severely behind some new features I added. I created a new repo (to have access to another GitHub Page)
https://nolansoo.github.io/ai-essay-grader-dev (contains some features such as written feedback reports)
