- This is the source code for my trials (using Source Dependent 8th grade - 3rd essay set) as that was the last thing tested.
- The "release-development" branch is for my work on an eventual release with the features I mentioned I wanted to add in the future in the Reflection slides, the video, and the interview (I will most likely mention it/or already have, depending on when you read this) - I am using ai-essay-grader-dev to publish it as a webpage but am keeping this branch so the source code is visible here as well
